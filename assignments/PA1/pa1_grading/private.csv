5,Fun Times,"This is a great little system for the family room. If someone is watching the TV, just pick it up and go. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe has been hours of fun. The only issue for a lot of folks can be the controller size. When removed from the main part of the system to play multi-player games, your fingers and feel cramped. They're really small. Other than that, can't wait to pick up some more games."
1,HORRIBLE!,It sucks.
4,Great programs. Great price.,"I ordered this pack simply to try out combat chess. It's a newer version of a very old game called battle chess. The pieces fight when they capture. Animation is good, and it makes the game humorous.  The pack also includes Maurice Ashley Teaches Chess. This is probably my favorite because you get to watch actual chess games between Grandmasters! Maurice comments on the moves and explains why they were made. I find it fascinating to watch the 13-year-old Bobby Fischer outwit his opponent by thinking 10-13 moves ahead. This program is good for children or beginner players because the first few lessons explain in detail how each piece moves, how the game is played etc... It is also good for higher-level players because the advanced lessons are good memory and logic exercises.  For you windows 2000 users, these are the only two programs that will run. That is unfortunate, but they are 2 very good programs, and I would have still purchased this product if I knew that ahead of time."
5,Awesome!!!!,"I just received this game today and started playing it.  For years I have wanted to find something that is fun and exercise, something that doesn't feel like a workout.  I have purchased workout video after workout video and either never did them, or did them once and that was it.  This game is so much fun and you don't even realize that you're getting exercise at the same time.  I am 31 years old and I totally love this game.  I think I could do it all day long!  You get a great workout and have so much fun.  I have only tried ""freestyle mode"" so far, but I plan on trying everything.  In freestyle mode, you get a letter grade for your performance.  I started off most songs getting a C or even a D and am now getting A's on all of them.  There are way more advanced modes as well.  This game will keep me busy for a while and hopefully burn a lot of calories.  If I enjoy this game and actually use it, so will you.  I promise it will be a great investment, no matter what your age is.  Buy it!!!"
1,"Pre-Ordered, may be returning.","I've been eagerly awaiting the release of this game for years and pre-ordered it months ago.  I am now bitterly disappointed to learn of the outrageous DRM policy.  As someone who has a lot of hardware who tends to reformat hard drives from time to time, this is a real problem.  Much as I was looking forward to Spore, I may now simply ship it back.  Disgusting!"
2,What's all the hype about?,"Everyone must have brain fog because this game is not the masterpiece that its claimed to be. Gameplay is clunky, the open world is sparse, and the graphics are meh with pop-in textures galore. Stop being a try-hard and go play something besides a souls-like for once."
5,great fun for the family,we loved this game it was great fun for everyone we had lots of laughs
5,"Just Like The Old WiiMote, Only It's In Black.","This worked exactly as expected, and it finally comes in black!  This Wii Remote works exactly like the old WiiMote from the original Wii, as far as I know.  I got it for my partner and I to play Mario Kart 8 together since she was used to the WiiMote controls from Mario Kart Wii.  It works just as you'd expect it to."
1,Only one ear has audio.,Right out of the box only one of the sides of the headset worked. Had it replaced and the new one we received is the same. Only one ear has audio.
5,Fantastic Case for the Nintendo Switch!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND,"I've been wanting to get a case for awhile, but wanted the 'right one'. And this case exceeds my expectations. The switch fits perfectly and safely in the case, and there's plenty of room for games and other accessories. Highly recommend!"
5,Try different things to pair to Fire TV.,"Bought as a second unit since I got one Fire controller last year on Prime Days for the Grandkids.  Didn't want to spend a ton for something used maybe twice a year and they wanted to play against each other when visiting last week.  As others have stated it was difficult to pair because I was following everyone else's directions.  For me, instead of HOLDING the mode and X, I just PRESSED them for a second and let go.  The red light started blinking and it showed up on the TV ready to pair.  If I HELD the buttons FIRE never found it.  The kids said it worked great."
5,Don't listen to the trolls,"If you're a fan of the previous two games then this game will blow you away. The graphics are spectacular and the open world aspect is a lot like S.T.A.L.K.E.R. It's a fantastic game with a lot of major improvements over its predecessors and couldn't reccomend it more. For those that are new to the series yes the sensitivity is lower than most fps games to make it more realistic and also the point of the game is survival horror, so don't try to kill everything you see!"
1,Frustrated,"It needs a 20-25Gb update before you can play the game. If I had known, I would never have bought this game. I live in a rural area with low data cap  and slow speeds. Constantly having to update games has just about made me give up on gaming. I love the fallout series but the constant need for high speed internet makes my butt want to take a dip of snuff. (It's irritating)"
1,Dead On Arrival.,Brand new system overheats and wont stay on for more than a few minutes. It was dead on arrival. Very disappointed.
5,"The case is very well made and fits very nicely, it looks and feels like it could be ...","The case is very well made and fits very nicely, it looks and feels like it could be an official Nintendo product. The Different angles are great when I like to play on my desk, far superior to the built in kickstand. Sliding the Joy-Con controllers in and out is very easy thanks to the design of this case. One really nice addition is the strap on the back that is handy for handheld mode. A detail that I appreciate a lot are the air intake cut outs, confusingly labeled as speakers in the product photos, that help keep the console cool where some other product don't. I would recommend you get this case if you're looking to take it on the go or just want to have a more protected console."
1,arm and leg,Cool figure but its not worth the price listed. I will wait for target or walmart to stock it.
1,Not sure yet,"I hope to enjoy the game..I got it yesterday from eb games and YES I noticed the online connectin required. HOWEVER, MOST WILL ASSUME THIS IS FOR REGISTRATION ONLY Its not an online game(primarily) . Until you actually open the box you dont realize that you are required to have one to even play.  I DONT agree with that AT ALL.  They will still get their money, this is the sort of thing thats driving pc gamers to console, and making these companies spend more on consoles than pc games (much to the chagrin of pc gamers).  While the game itself may be worth it, (looking forward to it) this BS with ""steam"" is definitely NOT"
1,does not work for switch,if i could give negative it would be negative 5 stars. purchased becAUSE IT SAID IT WORKED FOR NINTENDO SWITCH BUT IT IS NOT COMPATIBLE FOR NINTENDO SWITCH VERSION OF MINECRAFT.  WOULD HIGHLY NOT RECOMENED THIS PRODUCT. VERY DISAPINTEDIN THIS PURCASE STAY AWAY.
1,Don't buy this garbage,"Let me be clear, there is nothing, i repeat NOTHING special about this sd card, a standard micro sd card that costs less and has more storage will work PERFECTLY FINE WITH YOUR NINTENDO SWITCH, THIS IS NOTHING MORE THAN A SCAM."
5,Five Stars,"Fantastic headset for the price. Lacks some features of more expensive brands, but definitely a great find!"
5,Finally I can use the mic on my Astros A 50's on Xbox one!!!!!,I order this chat wire for my xbox one controller adapter and it works perfect with the Astro A50 headphones. I love it.
5,Best nerf shooting game EVER!,This is the best nerf game I've ever played! The red reveal feature that allows you to get secret codes is awesome!  Great for all ages.
5,Rayman is back and looking great on gameboy color!,"Rayman is back and better than ever on gameboy colors.  The graphics are awesome with a huge variety of color.  Rayman is trying to defeat the evil Mr. Dark and free all the toons. Like Warioland 3, this game also makes you  go back to free toons you couldn't before because of special abilities like  flying.  Without losing any lack of controls, this platformer is a keeper.  Rock on Rayman!"
1,Christmas Present that was DEFECTIVE,"Ordered this present early for my 3 kids - it was to be the ""big"" gift for the day.  They were so excited to set it up.  Guess what?  It didnt work - the power supply is apparently defective.  Not Amazon's fault - the purchase experience, packaging, speedy delivery was all great.  Spent an hour on hold with XBox Customer Service while they checked to see if they could replace the power supply without a fee (huh? it was brand new?  was there even a question?)....finally, she agreed to send a new one, and told me in approximately 10 business days I would receive it.  Cant tell you how disappointed we are with our first XBox experience."
5,"Comfortable grip, questionable storage.","I have no complaints about the grip itself.  It offers good support and has totally eliminated the cramping I was getting in my wrists.  It's comfortable, lightweight, portable, and very easy to remove from the 3DS unit. It fastens securely and never feels like it's going to fall off.  The stand works as it should and I'm glad I have it for when the 3DS gets Netflix.  I do have one small complaint though.  It seems silly to me that it would have a storage space for an SD card rather than a 3DS game card.  Since I only use one SD card it's pretty useless for me.  While not a huge inconvenience, it seems like a pretty big oversight, especially considering that I usually carry multiple game cards and an extra storage space would be very convenient. Besides, if I really needed to bring an extra SD card with me, but the only available slot held a 3DS cartridge, wouldn't it be pretty easy to just stick the SD card in there? SD cards are smaller in all three dimensions... Anyways, I am very happy with my purchase (great price, by the way) and I highly suggest it to anybody considering buying it."
5,Love my WriteWayPro!,"As an author, I struggled to keep my information together and contained but couldn't do it on my own the way I wanted. A friend suggested WriteWay, I downloaded the trial version and liked the program enough that I bought it. Once I learned my way around the program, I now have several books started with character traits and photos, location photos of where the story takes place, etc. The program allows me to do scenes within chapters, I can see my word count progress, check the number of pages per chapter, spell check, color code my POVs and characters plus much more. I love the program! I would recommend it to any author!"
1,Dead as many others with blue light of dead.,"Dead on arrival and amazon would not exchange, just refund. What I'm I supposed to do with a refund? Can't play with it. After 2 hour hold with Sony they are replacing my unit. Lady told me they are very aware and surprised almost all are coming from amazon.if you ordered one from amazon, don't even open it, return it!"
5,My son loves this game,"The graphics are amazing, my 9 year old son loves it."
1,Do NOT buy the 4GB for Halo: Reach.,"As of this writing, Halo: Reach is not properly programmed to address the 4GB of flash memory inside the Slim.  This means that any co-op (Campaign or Firefight) will not work.  Until a patch is released (who knows when that will be), go with the 250GB version."
1,Buy it on steam.,The only way to redeem this item is with Bethesda's terrible launcher.
2,Get it cheap,"Its a fun game to play on the go, but a huge downside to it is that in order to win XP and money from matches to unlock more stuff in the game, you need to be connected to wifi. I play this on work breaks and when I'm out, you don't always have the luxury of internet connection. Just another classic example at how 2K messed up yet again with another game."
2,Why is there no power cord,Why did I get no power cord what happened there did they just forget the thing actually needs power to work like are you serious
1,Poorly Developed,"Although the Micro Sleeve is a perfect fit to the GBA Micro,it is almost comepletely pointless. The GBA Micro comes with a cotton bag already to fit the Micro in. This sleeves looks to be something u can have on while playing but that is not possible. The GBA Micro Sleeve isn't comfortable while playing. The sleeve it self makes it hard to push buttons. The start and select button along with the left and right trigger are not even visable. The only thing I can see useing this for is carrying it, but thats what the cotton bag is used for."
5,Worked Great,We connected the controllers and they worked great out of the package.
5,Great replacement for original,"After the cat chewed through my OEM cord, I replaced it with this one and haven't noticed a difference. Works perfectly, and now I hide it in an ottoman where the cat hasn't figured out how to get at it... Yet."
5,One of The Best Games of the Decade,"I must admit I really enjoy playing a good RPG or JRPG, and recently it seems there's been a lack of them. When I first heard of Ni No Kuni, it was a few weeks before the release date, I read a few reviews, including IGN's and immediately felt the need to buy this game. I'm not sure if it was the visuals that Studio Ghibli is famed for, or if it was the music. But, I knew i wanted it, so I went out and purchased it on the day it was released. As soon as I started the game, it brought back those childhood memories of watching films like Howls Moving Castle, Princess Mononoke, and Spirited Away. The way the visuals were done so well is probably my favorite part of the game. After playing 10 hours through the story, I realized that it is just an amazing game and that I definitely got my moneys worth here, if you're teetering on buying this game, go for it :)"
5,Great Family Game,"This is the only game (garden warfare and this one) that my wife will play with me in the last couple years- We split or take turns.  Game can strategically be advanced, yet also super playful that any age would benefit from.  Garden warfare and chill weekend coming up! (Tmi?)"
1,Not satisfied,It's missing a part that was not told about in the description of the console
5,The Original puts Uncharted on the run,I will make this review short and sweet. The graphics are amazing the story is solid the visual and cinema-tics  are nothing short of breath taking. If you had any doubts of this game fear not. This game is great. I have not been able to stop playing. So do yourself a favor or someone else a favor. Go out right now and buy this game after reading this!
5,Works for pc!,Packaging came with the corner crushed but the controller was fine. WORKS WITH PC!!! its a nice matte black with a really industrial feel. For 40 bucks you can't get better quality powera didnt skimp they just took out the wireless features to make it cheaper. The cord actually locks in and you have to depress 2 side buttons on the side of the micro usb to get it to come out so thats kinda good and bad. Nice grips on the edges of the sticks. Overall i do recommend this u can change the colors and make it breathe to match your setup ive never felt bumpers and triggers this nice maybe its the new xb x design or its powera idk but it feels heavy duty.
1,"Waste of money, and a system.","No one is gonna buy this, and if they do, it WILL kill their system at some future point when they forget to remove it. The system doesnt attract dust when powered down, it attracts dust when its ON."
5,"A Fun game, with great replay value","This game is fantastic.  You play as a pioneer in the wild west, seeking resources and adventure.  The game comes with four different modes, that change the goal of the game, along with the look and feel, just enough to make it interesting, but not too much, so you still feel like you are playing the same game. There's a lot going on for each game, which gives you options on how you want to try to win.  Overall, I loved the game, and would highly recommend it."
1,What a disappointment! This is not the Supercharges your kid is looking for!,My son saved up his money also to purchase this and what a disappointment. He said that this version is a mario cart-esque supercharges. The Wii version is not the version where you move through the game and try to defeat Kaos. If you are looking for the version that is the next game in the series DO NOT BUY THIS.
2,"Clunky, and old-fashioned, but still fun","I purchased this game after playing the far superior Freedom Force, and while that game runs rings around this one, Hero X is still entertaining in a retro way. Unfortunately, the game isn't very stable, even on a state of the art machine, and I frequently encountered problems with crashes, scrambled backrounds, and saved games that failed to load. That said, when the game did work, it was fun, if repetitive. Not much of a challenge. For real superheroic bang for your buck, hunt down Freedom Force instead."
5,Have it for 2 weeks and have to head back to review.,"This is a pretty decent product for the price from YCC team. The package include the manual, the usb cable, the thumbstick cover that they giving away for now and the charger itself. To be honest, they're pretty good! Not sure if they will charge faster with usb 3.0 but im feeling it. i just plug it to my fast samsung charger 3.0 and not to the ps4. After 2 weeks of using, I'm impressed, the charger feels pretty solid, fast on charging and looks good! Ha! and the last thing is they even give out thumbstick cover too. I already have one from KontrolFreak but who cares, free stuff is free!"
1,????,"I purchased this gift CARD to give as a gift, but what I received was an email with the code. So I had to copy the code and write it on one of my own Christmas cards to give to my grandson as a gift. Why advertise a digital gift CARD when what you get is an email with the code??????? Sorry, but I was disappointed. I really wanted an actual gift CARD."
1,"Save your money, Scrabble does not run on Windows XP","I'd give this game a -10 if Amazon had an option for it.  I've played Scrabble on-line and at home for years and absolutely love the game.  Atari has taken the game and ruined it for me.  Don't bother buying Scrabble Complete if you are running Windows XP.  It will lock up and IF you should get into the game it will run so slow you'll want to scream.  I had an old copy of Scrab Complete.  I thought it was a scratched CD so I bought a new copy.  In the mean time, I bought a new computer and when I installed the new copy it didn't run on my new puter.  I emailed Attari tech support and got the usual run around.  Try this, try that, send a copy of a file, blah, blah.  Here's an idea Atari, try installing a copy on an XP computer, then come up with a fix.  I'm serious people, save your money and hope Hasbro buys back the rights to Scrabble."
1,This wasnt the correct version.,I bought this thinking it would work on my 3ds. But this is the EUROPEAN version. So it wont work on US 3ds's. Im not too happy about this since nowhere did it say it was the European version of the game.
4,No power supply included.,"This is a great product. However it does not come with the power supply needed to power it up. Nowhere on the instructions, the box, or the description does it mention needing to purchase a seperate power supply. Amazon would not help me with this. I had to steel one from a home security camera to get it to power up and now I have to contact logitech."
1,Waste of Money,"This car charger came with the Inetec case, and although it looks very stylish, it has one very serious design flaw. It wouldn't stay in the lighter slot on either my wife's Saturn SL2 or in my Geo Metro! It was popping out so frequently that my wife and I were having to trade turns holding it in the slot so we could get the PSP to charge. If you really need a car charger, try the Pelican charger instead. It worked right out of the packaging, and was certainly a lot less trouble."
1,Don't do it.,"3 words, Always on DRM. (I guess that is technically six)  This could be great game but you can't play offline, ie on the airplane or a place you don't have the internet. For a game where there is no social element required, though it is a nice add on here, that is ridiculous.  If all my software was like this I might as well not own a laptop.  So, I am going to call this a desktop only game, that is assuming EA fixes the servers on their side which is another ball of wax entirely.  What happened to you MAXIM?"
1,SYSTEM DOESNT WORK!! DONT BUY!!!,"I ordered this consule and was so excited to play again. Only to find out that when it arrived, I doesnt display on my TV at all. Turns on, but no sound, video or anything at all. Light is on it rotates the discs. But I am definitely disappointed. Dont buy this product. Going to return mine."
1,don't even think about getting this pass there's hardly any ...,don't even think about getting this pass there's hardly any content and it repeats the same mundane tasks of the previous version of destiny. Spend your money elsewhere and just get a new game. Of course this is my opinion.
1,"No adventure, just action.","This game was so disappointing; I can't even begin to detail the inadequacies.  If I had wanted an action game, I would have bought one.  I was so looking forward to this since I have enjoyed all three predecessors.  No mouse control at all.  And, as I read in other reviews, going in a straight line is really difficult.  I don't play action games so I am figuring that, if you're use to them, the characters in GOF are easy to control but I'm not use to action games.  This is really second rate.  Where are the secret places?  Where are the puzzles?  Who cares about killing these stupid monsters?  I'm only on the second level and I don't want to move forward.  What a bore. What a disappointment.  I've bought other EA games and they are action rather than adventures games, so I was angry at myself for those, but I'm mad at EA for this one.  I preordered it, assuming it would be in the same vein as the previous three - boy, was I disappointed.  Wonder how many times I can say that?  Don't buy it, if you haven't already.  The first day I was already looking for cheats or patches - anything to make the game more doable and usable."
4,Pretty good,This doesn't shoot as fast as you are led to believe but aside from that it works well
1,unhappy,had to down load from separate disk then was told didnt have enough gigga bites just didnt like cant play
5,Worth it!,Really pretty wireless controller. Easy to sync and very responsive. Worth it!
5,Be patient,For all the parents out there hang in there I just found him locally at a major video game retailer along with thumpback
1,Ridiculous,"Really pissed off. Although information was given about the board, it doesn't say it's required to play. I was irate when I saw that. I would strongly encourage people to buy from a different source."
1,You better keep your money,"I feel so dissapointed about this cases. A friend of mine made the purchase for me with his account and received it today and what a surprise. The condition is not 'used', but awful, all cases are totally useless for what I wanted them. My damaged PS4 cases are in better condition than this. I wasted my money and my time."
1,False advertising!,False advertising! I thought I was buying multiple thumb caps according to the picture. Only got one set
5,Awesome,Very happy with this stand. Its build tuff and don't fall over like the cheap stands. Has 3 USB ports that charge pretty quick. The stand has a power button to turn off the charging device so your not burning power and it hasn't overheated with all ports charging.  Great value for the money.
5,James Is B-a-a-ack!!!!!,"I just rec'd this game the day it launched and I can tell you that the graphics may suck at very beginning of playing the game, but there is so much action that takes place, you'll soon pay no mind to it.  Compared to ""Quantum of Solace"", it surpasses it because the gameplay is by far the most refreshing thing to the gaming community. The controls are intuitive, not difficult at all to master because the game prompts don't take you by surprize. Boy! The action is top notch too! Even though I haven't finished the game yet, the game definitely reminds me and plays like ""Uncharted 2"". It truly is a very good game for even those hard core gamers. Get it a try, you won't be disappointed. It's not perfect with the graphics---but I'm sure the developer will do a patch to adjust it."
5,Miss information on this great product. It works!!!,"So I watched a how to install video on YouTube and it wasn't specific to this item. If you look at the small tabs on the bumpers they go into small slots in the controller. Once you align those you will hear the click and it's ready to put back together. If anyone runs into that issue message me. Also, I've seen some people saw the back of the replacement is missing the middle tab. You don't need that. I hope this helps anyone stuck trying to reattach the bumper.  The company responds back asap."
5,Great quality for the price.,"Great headset for the price, very comfortable can be worn for hours without discomfort,adjustable head band moves a fair amount to allow comfort.Sound quality is clear, chat audio comes through clearly aswell as game audio. Noise cancellation works great. The mic sounds clear with little peaking asked multiple people they could all hear me really well. Comes with all plugins for PS4, and computer gaming. Cord is a decent lenght, when plugged into a usb port headset produces bright blue light on the headset and mic. Very happy with this product definitely worth the price."
5,works perfect,works perfect
5,"I lost my job, my home and my wife because of this game!","It's that good!  Just kidding.  Actually, the game is very good.  I remember the last decade of the Cold War very well and this is a lot of fun for that reason alone.  You can really get tactical with this game and the equipment is pretty accurate.  Just make sure you have all of your important things done before you get started.  ;-)"
1,NOT RETURNABLE EVEN IF YOU GET A DEFECTIVE CONTROLLER - BE WARNED,"Purchased two controllers and both gave phantom inputs on both PC and Raspberry Pi.  Bought because of the reviews, but item and quality control has really suffered.  Furthermore, upon trying to return this DEFECTIVE item to amazon, I was told that it was not eligible for returns even though it is not clearly listed in any of the descriptions.  Don't waste your money on this gamble."
2,For parents,"One important aspect that parents might consider is the language used in this game. I would not expect the ""f..."" word to be mild, but the rating apparently does. My 10 year old loves the game, but he plays with the volume off because of inappropriate language."
1,Not good for XBOX controller,I made the mistake of purchasing this after reading the many positive reviews.  I specifically bought it to play with my xbox one controller on my pc.  The micro USB that attaches to the controller doesn't fit in well. It partially hangs out (no good click or snap). It works but I have to position it correctly for it to work. One wrong move and I become disconnected during the middle of an online game.  Avoid this product.
5,Amazing Price and Good Quality,"These work perfectly with my Gamecube.  I have had no issues, and they seem to lock in pretty tightly.  Just so you know, each one is six feet long, so with four of these, you can definitely make longer runs of cable than you can possibly need."
1,"Great For Children, But................","If you are an adult looking to buy a 3DS do not get this version. Yes, it is cheaper, but the clam shell design is gone, which means the system can no longer be closed together. Which means that it's much harder too transport, you can no longer carry it in your'e pocket, you MUST buy a case or it will not last very long. The button placment is akward, especially if you have big hands. The joystic is especially annoying because it feeels like its too high up. No 3D effect, the 3D in some games could significantly add to the experiances and even improve the graphics on some games. Now the games graphical quality seems much lower without the 3D. This console is good for younger children, but that's it. For any older children or adults I recommend you buy the 3DS XL, that system has all the features that this has and all the ones it dosen't. Plus, the screens are bigger, but thank's to it's design it is still smaller than the 2DS."
1,Didn't work on my xbox 360. Kept asking me ...,"Didn't work on my xbox 360. Kept asking me for to infall a Xbox 360 hard drive, which is installed."
2,Does not charge...,"I plugged in my two move controllers and nothing happened. Normally a light would come on saying it is being charged, but no lights changed on this. I left them on till the next day and tried to turn them on and they were died. They was on there for at least 24 hours so it should've charged then."
5,Switch case,Very nice quality switch cases comes when multiple different things for your switch very durable very heavy duty great for somebody that has a switch and like  to travel this will keep your switch protected from getting damaged higher recommended
5,Starfox has always been one of my favorite games!,"My love for Starfox goes way back to when I was a kid and starfox came out for SNES. My father took my mother and I to dinner at the Olive Garden and he snuck away for awhile during our dinner. I didn't think much of it until later on that night when he presented Starfox for the SNES for me. My small brain was blown away by the sheer awesomeness of this game. Now having been some 20 years into the future and my parents having recently passed away I thought it would be fun to relive a memory so vivid from my childhood by playing this wonderful game. It is in fact wonderful! It fulfills my dream to pilot the Ar-Wing from the cockpit as well as see amazing visuals updated for a modern age. It allowed my to relive the memory of my father without feeling sad for once,a year since his passing. Simply one of the best things I could have asked for. Thank you Nintendo and Platinum games for giving my something so fun to play to help me grieve as well as throughly enjoy. Nintendo will always be apart of my happy place. Thanks again!"
4,Good but weird packaging,"The product looks and works fine but it didn't come in a package. It was just the instruction manual, cord, and battery wrapped up in bubble wrap. Seemed kinda weird to me especially since it said it was sold by Microsoft when I ordered it."
5,I love how it's convenient and safe!,I LOVE this car seat and stroller. It's exactly what we needed and the price is great too. Easy to use and safe. Evenflo is one of my favorite car seat brands. I'm a Certified Child Passenger Safety Technician and I would recommend this car seat. I enjoy the fact that I can click it in and out of the stroller. Super convenient. It has straps to hold the car seat into the stroller and there is a place for the front end to also click into the stroller.
2,"Must NOT buy,  play originals versions","Don't buy the 360 version there is no patch for it. Unless you are a super fan of Silent Hill, I wouldn't recommend this Collection to anyone.  These games were made with a incomplete build of the original games from the ps2. This collection takes away from the originals were supposed to be played, the HD exposes what was not meant to be seen in the original versions.  I suggest finding a ps2 and tge games with it to get a true proper experience."
5,If your a gamer buy this,I like because it fits well in my hand and you can play well with this
5,Freaking awesome,These things are fantastic. Must haves for die hard Zelda fans. The detail is incredible and you get bonuses in game!
1,No disks for other RE titles with this. Very misleading!,I purchased Resident Evil Anthology thinking it would include the physical disks for the other 1-5 RE titles. Guess what?  It doesn't!  Aside from the sub-par RE 6 games 1-5 are downloadable content only.  What a major let down.  I'm returning this item.
1,Pre Order Bonus Code missing,"The game was recently delivered to my door.  I  immediately searched for my pre order bonus code and found nothing.  Theres no code, no information or anything.  I pre ordered the game several weeks in advance to make sure I got the bonus content, but I got nothing except the basic game"
4,It's ight,"Its alright, only if amazon allowed for normal people to get their hands on it."
4,Why not buy a DS?,Why would you buy this now? It was really cool a couple of years ago but you should buy a Nintendo DS. It will play all the GBA games plus the DS games for only a little bit more. They've already stopped making games for this system. After Christmas I highly doubt they'll even have games available anymore. Get a DS. Just trying to be a buddy and help.
1,Not worth it. Please wait for the price to go down if you want to buy this title.,I was so excited for the release of this game I preordered it back in december! I spent days imagining the fun I would have playing Street Fighter 5. Then the day came. I'm completely dissatisfied.
5,"It's got a compelling story, great graphics and scenes that make you jump. Everything you need in a game!","I SHOULD write that I HATE it because I never see my husband anymore because HE is the one who LOVES this game so much - that I never see him!! But, with that said, it WAS a Christmas gift, so I'm really happy that I picked something he liked (finally!) that had to do with video games. He's VERY hard to buy for with his PS3 and PS4, but I succeeded! Yay me! Yay Dishonored 2! I've watched him play (I do that, I live vicariously) and I've got to say it's got a compelling story, great graphics and scenes that make you jump. Everything you need in a game! So, Yes, I Definitely will Recommend this game!"
5,Looks Fabulous,"This keyboard and mouse look fabulous, I only have one issue with them the lettering is not really bright and sometimes I have to look  for specific keys and they're a little hard to see, but other than that I really love this set I also got my husband the same set for his comp and he really likes them also. Now my daughter saw them and wants a set too. Update, I spilled a glass of tea into my keyboard and it stopped working but I love this set so much and the price is right so I bought another set. I really love this set if I could give it more stars I would."
2,Reduced the number of players,"Wipeout in the Zone, the first Wipeout game for the Kinect, while it has it flaws, is fun. The four of us (Mom, Dad, and 2 boys) get together and have a few laughs watching each other get knocked about. We gladly purchased this version, Wipeout 2, but when we booted up the game we found that it's only for 2 players! I've never seen a video game series reduce the number of players from one version to the next. Hugely disappointed."
1,Horrible Sony,Sony gotta do better
1,One Star,No pace at all wingers are useless
5,"Best head strap, works with VRPOWER with slight modification","Fits extremely well.  I have tried the other halo straps, the Oculus elite strap, and the HTC DAS, and this is my favorite head strap.  I did cut two identical slots next to the rear slot which allowed the VRPOWER to attach with no other modifications.  This complete setup is very comfortable and has great balance to allow for extended game play."
5,Solid battery packs at a great price,"This product is a great value for the money, and it works well too. The battery life is really good and compares well against other leading competitors. The charger dock is simple and easy to use and makes recharging a no-hassle task. Overall, very pleased with this product."
5,Great Product,"this is a good product i have been using it for some time now and love how the cartridge compartment is removable, but it grips well and feels like im hold a controller with a screen on it, looking forward to buy more products from this company"
5,It's perfect for me,"This case is awesome! Just got it so I can't really say if it holds up for long. But it fits the games I play the most, it is a snug fit but that means they won't go sliding out. The pouch holds my new 3ds xl with a crystal casing tight and perfect, might have to glue some velcro so it'll stay in the case. And the zipper pouch is great, holds my charger, cleaning cloth and little baggy of styluses and there is still more room for earphones or keys or whatever. I notice Mine didn't have the little keten flap like the others but oh well, it's no biggie. I would rate this 10 stars if I could, would buy again!"
4,Very good buy,Very nice controllers for a nice price.
1,Not for tennis players,"I got this game for my birthday and took it back.  I play tennis and love playing tennis.  I would play everyday weather permitting.  This game was suppose to be better than the last one because the technology is available to one to use the Wii remote like a tennis racket.  Instead of doing what they should have done for some reason the game developers decided that we tennis players want to go back to playing tennis from our couches, pushing endless buttons to play tennis.  Shame on you.  I thought you had learned better by now.  I am over 50 years old and like to play active games and I know a lot of people my age who paid good money for our Wii so that we could play active games.  What were you thinking.  So here is my suggestion to game developers:  Get out of your chair and play tennis then develop a tennis game for the rest of us."
5,Great great game,"I'm a big tomb raider fan and having beat that game several times, I needed a new game. I bought far cry 3. I was hooked. Then I found out far cry 4 was coming out. I had to have it. I ordered it and a a few days later I began my journey. I am not disappointed. The graphics are wonderful and there's so much to do. My favorite part is looking for all of the masks, etc. riding the elephants is pretty awesome too."
5,Great Way to Revisit an All-Time Classic,"As someone who still has his Nintendo 64 and this game, I've found it less and less pleasant to play this as time has gone on. Even keeping a CRT in my basement for retro gaming, the 64 just doesn't hold up as well as and it's sad watching games I love become more and more unplayable relative to modern gaming. I picked this remake up among a pile of games for my (new) New 3DS XL and quickly found myself abandoning several other half-finished games (looking at you, Samus Returns) in favor of playing this to completion. Like an old house that's still in great functional shape, sometimes all you need is a fresh coat of paint, and that's exactly what this game delivers. The underlying mechanics of Ocarina of Time are still a blast and being able to short portable spurts suits this game well, especially considering how small the game now feels compared to when it launched in 1998. Graphics aside, a few small tweaks have been made to modernize the experience but my only gripe with this is the update they DIDN'T include. I would have much appreciated it if the developers had removed the old system where your location is reset every time you boot up the game. Granted, as you progress, you learn song that warp you to the general area you want to go, but that still result in some time wasted when a modern portable game should reload you at the last doorway you went through, or some other streamlined system. Still, a small gripe. The game felt great and controlled smoothly. The graphical update does everything it should without robbing any of the original charm. Playing this made me very eager to revisit Majora's Mask soon. If you've never played a 3D Zelda game, this is a recommend starting point."
5,Great Value,I was sceptical that a gaming keyboard would really make a difference. But for the price it seemed worth a try. The keyboard (and the mouse) make a huge difference in my game play. Well worth the price!
1,Not worth it! Don't Buy!,First after doing research these codes are not really random as is it just chooses from a group of worthless games on steam instead of the whole store and it is really possible to get duplicates. It is best not to purchase this and go on steam and look for sales or use humble bundle to get a bunch of games that are worth something plus you know what games you getting.
5,Mac Mechanical Keyboard,"I am currently using this keyboard on a Mac.  Typing experience is completely different than typing on a traditional mac keyboard, longer key travel and louder.  It's a whole new experience."
5,Kamehameha!,"I really enjoy this game. Took me a little while to figure out how everything works but once I did I could not put it down. I love how you can activate the special attacks with the joycons by performing the actual hand movements from the show, it's like a small dream has come true! Kamehameha! ;)"
1,"The case sent did not fit my PS Vita, ...","The case sent did not fit my PS Vita, and in the description, i was led to believe it would. very sneaky..."
4,"Nice, but could be better.","I like the fact that it holds 60 games -- better than their older versions that held only like 28 or so. What I don't like is the fact that when you open it, the games don't stay and fly everywhere because it's tight when you try to open it."
1,"This is Vice City STORIES, not Vice City","This is Vice City Stories, not Vice City.  I spent 2 hours downloading and installing a game that I didn't want.  Thanks."
1,Disappointing,"Story feels like it was written by an 8 year old, voice acting is absolutely horrible to the point of distracting, load times are ridiculous after your character dies (go have a cup of coffee).  More than an hour into the game, so far this sequel doesn't hold a candle to its predecessors. Weapon upgrades are tedious, too much time is spent gathering materials needed for building sparse equipment. Overall gameplay is slow and outright boring."
2,Not a 6pack,"Love Ferrero Roches, especially the dark chocolate ones. Wanted to have multiple packs to gift other people so chose this 6pack over other listings. However only 2 bags were delivered. Amazon was great and fast to issue a refund but this item description needs revision."
1,"Awful, absolutely awful","Want a game that manages to get worse every year? Want a game whose winner is determined by the games random bugs and AI deficiencies? Want hours of frustration? Want a developer who's only interested in exploiting children via microtransactions, instead of actually improving the game? Then this game is for you!"
1,If I could give this zero stars I would....,"This game models the epitome of greed and laziness put forth by EA in releasing this excuse for a game. The game is horribly buggy, crashes every 10 minutes, and you have to wait over 30 minutes to even get logged into a server to play a SINGLE PLAYER GAME. This was a complete waste of 60 dollars and I'll be pursuing a charge back with my credit card. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UNLESS YOU ENJOY FINGERNAILS RUNNING DOWN A CHALKBOARD FOR A GOOD TIME."
1,Everything about the game is broken,The game is broken. Better buy PES this year instead.
5,The Return Of Megami Tensei,"Megami Tensei, or Persona, as it's known in the States comes back with Persona 2: Eternal Punishment...and it was well worth the wait.  Eternal Punishment (one half of Persona 2, along with Innocent Sin) improves on nearly every aspect of the first Persona.  There is an improved fighting engine, more persona to master, and the real gem of the game, the Contact System, has been greatly expanded upon.  This feature, unique to the Megami Tensei series, allows you to avoid battles at times, instead opting to CONVERSE with your opponents...a novel concept indeed.  Everything is done better in Eternal Punishment than in the original, and it will offer RPG fans a refreshing taste of something new and different in the genre.  Don't miss it."
5,Great product!,Receive the product in great condition and the shipping was prompt and the product works great no malfunctions
2,makes the headset run hotttt!!!,"basically put it on for one session and removed it. the side strap covers ripped once i put the head set up and down a couple times where the strap rotates on the kiwi design headstrap replacement, which is the best headstrap ever made. i love kiwi accessories, just not this one. real review right here!!! no bots needed. im a human who typed this and hit enter!!!"
2,Do not get this game.,Very disappointed. As far as graphics go...AMAZING.  But game play.....well I will say I was bored about 4 hours into it.  Greatly disappointed.
5,A great buy,"I got this for my son as a Christmas gift.  I am very happy with purchase.  The cooling stand came with two batteries for his controllers that allow them to be recharged.  This is great because he was going through batteries like toilet paper - LOL.  I like the fan because it helps cool the gaming system.  The fan does not come on automatically as you have to turn on yourself.  However, it's just a push of a button.  Overall, happy, happy, happy."
5,People Seem to be Confused,"This is a DLC code, yet it looks like the bad reviews thought it was the full game. Some people don't pay attention, don't let that affect this purchase. This DLC is as big as the main game with new mechanics added."
1,I really hate to leave this review as I loved the Elite ...,"I really hate to leave this review as I loved the Elite remote when it worked. It feels like a solid piece of engineering but after just a few weeks of light use the left stick wasn't working correctly. Okay, it happens, sometimes you get a bad batch however the replacement remote that I got ALSO was broken, right out of the box. The 'A' button seemed to not work at all at first however if pressed at an angle somewhat, it would register the touch about 10 times. I had a lot of high hopes for this remote however it was a huge let down."
1,"Fraud, game never works","Do not buy this game from this source. These 2k17 games are corrupt with the logo screen lockup that prevents you from ever playing a game.  Sometimes it might work but most if the time you spend an hour and never never play the damn game. You make the fix from YouTube, then the game does a forced update and goes back to the same pick up crap. This is fraud !!!!"
5,Great price!,"We bought this arcade game, Ms Pac Man, to add to our game room. We had earlier purchased another arcade game at another store. We got Ms Pac Man for almost half the price as the other arcade machine! So, amazing price! Easy assembly, works great! We are loving it!"
1,simiwantmymoneyback,"So if I buy something, and it doenst work, does that not entitle someone to get their money back?  One would think, right?  However, anyone wanting refunds on this are being turned away, yet its not even playable.  Go figure.  Just dispute your credit card charges."
5,"Versatile, powerful, fun","If you can find previous versions of Fritz, buy them. They are cheaper and can do everything that Fritz 10 can (for a hobbyist player) and don't require a CD to be present in the drive at all times. Beginning with version 8 (and updates), ChassBase introduced a very nice feature when you can watch their video demonstrations with synchronised pieces movement on the board."
1,"Never again ,cheap ,cheap cheap.,but not in price ,just construction.","Pip boy is a plastic piece of junk ,first button or what I thought was a button broke off now rattles inside .its basically a cheap holder for your I phone with an fallout 4 app .that screen in the pic is just a thin piece of cardboard with a pic on it .all buttons are just for looks no function."
5,Super Mario is the greatest!,"I recently purchased this Super Mario All Stars edition for my Wii U. As a kid, I loved the Mario brothers games in the early 1990's, most especially Super Mario Bros 2 and 3. To anyone out there who grew playing the Super Mario Brothers games in the 1980's and early 1990's, I recommend that you buy this game. The nostalgia of playing the games again have brought back great memories for me. This game includes the original Super Mario Brothers, Mario the Lost Levels, Super Mario 2, and Super Mario 3. This is a must buy for old school Mario lovers!"
5,Perfect,Bought this for my brothers ps3 and they work great and also love how they look really cool 5 stars next going to buy the pink an blue one !
4,"awesome game, very difficult to play","This WW2 combat game puts you behind the Axis front near the waning months of the war to end fascism in Europe (tunfortunately Communism took over after the war in Eastern Europe).  You play an American soldier who begins the mission storming the beaches of Nazi-occupied Northern France, and continue through killing schusstaffel soldiers with weapons like shotguns, M-1 rifle, colt 45 pistol, the sniper rifle, grenades. grenade launcher, etc...  The game is a first person shooter with beautiful nearly photo-realistic graphics and intense sound effects.  This game would be perfect if 1) aiming the weaponry was a little more control-friendly to the gamer, and 2) more realistic physics (enemies in reality probably do not lean over and fall down dead peacefully after being hit in the chest with a 70 pound tank gun bullet fired from a Sherman at 50 yards)  The levels get increasingly difficult and some are rediculously impossible.  other than those three things, the game is a good buy."
5,Beautiful color flop with brilliantly shiny flake,I've only had it few a few days but the paint is by far incredible. Beautiful color flop with brilliantly shiny flake. It's also very smooth to the touch. Overall I'm beyond impressed with the colors and quality of this faceplate. Fits perfectly.
4,Like Brain Age for the eyes,"If you've played Brain Age, you'll know what to expect from this game. It's somewhat fun. Doesn't take long at all to do the exercises. Seems it's more of an observance teacher than something to improve eyesight."
5,Works perfectly,Simple and works
5,Son likes it.  Win for me!,"Got this for my son and took it up to him while he was visiting my parents. I told him he had to let me know how it works, so this is what he says.  He said it seems to last a little longer than his old one, and actually feels a little better in his hands. His last one was just a little too big, which made it very hard for him to control the joysticks. He seems very happy with this, and said that it actually mounts his phone, which is a Galaxy S7, just a bit more snug. When he moves the controller, the phone does not wiggle around either like his other one. So, I guess he likes it, so I look like a winner dad.  LOL"
5,Works,"Works fine, it just doesn't turn my console on by pressing the round button as it usually does."
5,"... to use at work thinking it would be a fun, colorful conversation piece and that it probably wouldn't ...","I bought one of these 8 months ago to use at work thinking it would be a fun, colorful conversation piece and that it probably wouldn't last long considering the price. I enjoyed it so much and it held up so well that 3 months ago I bought another one to replace my expensive gaming keyboard at home. This keyboard is awesome! I love the feel of the key function, the rotating backlight, and the raised key feature for ease of cleaning. It performs as well as the gaming keyboard I had, and I enjoy the feel of the key function more for gaming as well. Both keyboards are still going strong with no issues. Lots of bang for your buck!"
1,Garbage controller,Lost connection at random times (at least every 1-2 minutes during multiplayer games) with multiple fresh batteries inserted. Other controllers work well with my Xbox 1. Might have been a random issue with the controller they sent me but I wouldn't risk it again. Issues were so annoying I went office space rather than return it.... See picture.
4,Four Stars,It would be 5 stars if not for the tiny hard to see and find power and eject buttons.
5,Wow! This is a close 2nd to the Wavebird!,"Or maybe on even footing if they can both stand on the podium together. But this one is rechargable directly from the NCG's controller port (5 volts DC), which is a big bonus. Mine came with a bent pin on the battery pack and wasn't making complete contact to charge up, but that's an easy fix if you have a butter knife handy. Oh, and the batteries are regular NiMH rechargables. Nice to know if the battery pack finally gives out."
5,Nintendi Wii REnewed,I purchased this for my 17 year old granddaughter for her birthday.  Finally got it set up today and she and her friend have been playing non-stop and having a blast
5,Good buy!,"The shoulder button on my right Joy-Con wasn't working properly (even after replacing the wire) and I didn't want to spend too much, so I went for an used one. I feared the worst but lucky me, the Joy-Con was in perfect condition, no scratches or scuffs and most importantly, no drifting on the stick."
5,So cute and such great quality!,"tbh i didn't buy these for gaming, but i'm in love! i needed a comfortable pair of over-the-ear headphones because i need in-the-ear hearing aids, and i can hear music but can't wear my old earbuds. these are comfy af, they fit perfectly over my ears and hearing tech, and i can wear them for a few hours a time without feeling any aches or discomfort! i can listen to music while writing or working without being interrupting by ANY sound around me! i can't review them for gaming, but the sound quality is perfect and the headphones are super cute and snuggly!! love love love!!"
5,It introduced me to my WiiU,"I love it. I've had my wiiU since launch, but this game really made me grow to love it. The use of the map, Item management on the gamepad is awesome!! I cant imagine playing this on any other console."
5,pretty good keyboard,"Its a pretty good keyboard. Since I'm a gamer the first thing I always do when I get a new keyboard is pop the caps lock key right off (curse that little devil) and it was a little more difficult than usual so I'm hoping that is an indication of quality. It goes clickety-clack and has good feel and response. The pulsing lights were annoying me but all you have to do is hit the Fn key then the little sun key and you can switch between on, off and pulsing."
4,Bend the tabs if too tight!,"Works good, would be 5 stars but as everyone else said they lock in way too tight. To overcome this just bend the tabs a few times, now its no problem!"
2,The headset stopped working after 2 weeks! Returned.,"They were for my son's birthday and after 2 weeks of use they developed green horizontal lines across the screen and finally went entirely blank. Returned for a set from Bestbuy, hopefully these will last longer."
5,A great seek and find game with excellent story line and puzzles,"I really enjoyed this seek and find game.  You need to search for objects and combine objects to solve more complex puzzles.  Most levels require you to navigate between several scenes to find all the objects and solve each puzzle to enable you to move to the next level.  The storyline involves a couple who have been separated from one another by a time portal.  I liked the creativity of the story and the graphics.  I also enjoyed that this game was fairly long.  It took me several days to finish (probably 6-8 hours) -- that is much longer than many of the new games being released.  The puzzles were challenging enough to be interesting, but not terribly frustrating.  This is the best game of this genre that I have played in quite some time."
5,Great Game,Great game with lots of action. Excellent seller. Story is amazing with likeable characters. New content is great with lots to do.
4,It helps,I bought this video game for my husband so he could learn to fix up the house.
2,Not for Apple TV,Wanted it for Apple tv so returned it
4,Super Kawaii but a little small and won't really keep things safe,"I'm not sure if it's due to having the second release of the Switch (not switch lite, just the second release of the switch with slightly bigger screen and more battery life) or if they just are marketing this for switch when it's more suited for a new 3ds xl, but it BARELY fits the body and the joycons with one usb cord inside. I highly recommend that if you get this, you have something to cover the touch screen ,as mine was slightly scratched. The joycons awkwardly fit in the pouches (you have to remove a cover first if you have one and then remove the joycons before placing it in the case). It's cute, but not worth the constant hassle of trying to get everything to fit so nothing breaks from sliding around. I'm using it as a 3ds case instead."
5,Great Upgrade,"I extremely recommend this, especially for the games that have come out lately, which may run slow without it. Other games won't even let you play the full version enless you have an expansion pack. I speeds up the game speed and raises the graphic quality by a lot. It makes a dramatic difference to your game. Go and buy it today."
1,No power.,Would not work with my ps4 slim. Returned for refund.
1,Shouldve called it Shat,"This game sucks. EA sucks. DRM sucks. Seaman for Dreamcast was better than this pile. What a waste of money this game is. Avoid at all costs. People call the Designer of this game (Will Wright) a genius, I call him a moron for making this game. Dont buy this game, if you do just know you will only be renting it. This game isnt for hardcore gamers, hence the reason they make it for the PC and the frikkin DS. Stupid game, stupid idea, stupid gameplay, stupid Spore."
5,Perfect combination of story and play,"If only more of this team's games were ported to the Mac! This is one of the best games I've played in years. Like some other strategy games, you control a team with various abilities, and there are multiple solutions to many of the challenges. But in this one, you get to be Robin Hood! There's a path for those who like to kill and ways to win with almost no bloodshed. It has humor, drama, and spectacular scenery. There's a satisfying number of challenges but a widely varied range of difficulty settings. I can't say enough good things about this game. It's easier and more low-key than Starcraft or Diablo--two of my all-time favorites. And it's slightly less engrossing than Escape Velocity, the best game ever designed for the Mac. But the blend of story, intercut movies, voices, and game play is almost impossible to beat. I can't believe that ""Dead or Alive,"" this team's other game, isn't available for OS X. It's almost enough to make me want a PC."
5,works great,it plugs snugly and charges a great rate. it looks and feels to be made to last. but time will till with my 11 year old lol.
5,Five Stars,A fun game for all to enjoy at his or her own pace.
1,Steer Clear...Big dud!!!!!,"I am probably one of the biggest Animal Crossing fans out there and have been playing and waiting for new releases since 2001. When this game was announced, I was elated...Sad to say but after having it a week it is absolutely boring and redundant. Once you build the city...it's pretty much a dud game. No tools, no fishing, no cute clothes, no digging or planting or mail. I am bored stiff! Creating houses for the animals to live in is nice but the rooms are super small and everything seems cramped. I am praying that Nintendo comes up with another game system and a full fledged AC game that is great every day...Maybe corporate business, farming, anything to give the game an exciting edge and a surprise each day. Save your money and wait for the next round. BORING!!!!!!!!!"
4,Enhances Game Play,I really enjoyed this purchase and it makes playing Wii Resort more fun. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that there is a snug fit with the attachments and the wii remote. It can be difficult to get it in but once its in its great. The frisbee attachment and archery bow really add to the game play.
1,PLEASE BEWARE!!!,"This is not a physical copy as one might think, by purchasing the disc. You only get one episode and the rest takes days to download.  If this is the future of gaming to these Telltale Turds, im done!  If you you work at Telltale, dont let the marketing idiots who drank their way through college run your shop.  When a person buys a physical copy of the game they expect it on the disc."
4,A very tight fit.,"This a good deal for what you get.  The travel case seems durable, if a bit small, and the buttons, clear case, and screen protector all went on smoothly.  I like the extra grip that the design of the clear case gives the Switch, however it does make the joycons incompatible with most accessories, and the clear casing is very difficult to remove once attached.  The casing around the screen component makes docking with a TV impossible while encased, but luckily the center casing is very easy to detach and reattach."
5,So far everything is good!,"The sound quality from these headphones is surprisingly excellent!  I wanted headphones to replace a set of USB  headphones.  For the price this replacement headphone, I believe, can't be beaten.  I highly recommend them."
4,Real Deal,"Did not expect him to be so tiny, but it was so worth it! The detail on the face is exact and the stand works. Downside is, the hands are a pain to put back on and the hair gets stuck whenever you try to switch the face. But other than that, love it!"
4,Great for the price!,Great sound and great mic only downside... above medium volume everyone can hear it.
4,Best.  Simpsons game.  Ever.,"This is without a doubt the best Simpsons game ever because it comes the closest to doing something that I've always wanted a Simpsons game to do and that is let you play an episode of the show.  Most Simpsons games have you doing silly nonsense like wrestling and fighting aliens and don't allow you to really interact with the Simpsons world.  Although it is not quite as interactive as I would like.  For instance you can't talk to people very often unless it is part of a mission.  Although they well talk quite a bit if you kick them in the head.  As far as the gameplay goes, there are several types of missions but they basically fall into several broad categories.  There are missions where you have to race people.  Another mission is the trail where you have to follow another vehicle and keep them from losing you and another mission that is the complete opposite in which you have to lose someone.  Some missions have multiple objectives, which can be annoying, especially since failing one objective means you have to go back and sart the whole mission over.  There are also missions where you have to wreck other people's vehicles.  This is the closest this game ever gets to Grand Theft Auto which is what this game is based on.  The only thing that I don't like is that this game gets really hard really quick.  Another bad thing is there is no map that comes with the game unlike Grand Theft Auto.  The only thing you have to guide you is a small radar like thing and green arrows to quide you in the general direction you want to go.  However, in order to beat the harder levels you need to find the shortcuts which the arrows do not point out.  in order to find them you have to scout out the area before starting the mission.  Luckily, you can skip missions after repeated failure which is good for people who suck at these type of games, like me.  I'm on the marge level now and I have only beaten one of the levels.  I've skipped at least three of them.  Other than the somewhat severe difficulty however this game is great.  Any Simpsons fan will love it."
5,Mikayla's Mom,"This is a wonderful game for any Dora fan.  My 4 year old just loves it and can't seem to put it down for very long.  I'm not sure what the problem is with the other reviews, but my daughter has no problem playing this game.  It has made long car rides very enjoyable!"
5,A must have for traveling!,"This was a godsend when I took my Xbox Series S with me on vacation! The console fits perfectly in it with much leftover room for controllers and accessories. There are also holes between the handles so that you can put a lock on it or zip-tie it shut. That was an unexpected, but highly appreciated feature! I recommend to others buying it for the same reason that you also get some ""fragile"" warning stickers. There are flat rectangular areas on every side of the case where they can be placed if the right size. A funny thing to mention too, and this is not a bad thing- after checking it in at the airport, they handled it with especially extra care because they thought it was a gun case! Each time I went to pick up my baggage they had it sitting in a secure area waiting for me verify ownership to pick it up! LOL! That made me pretty happy because I didn't have to worry about somebody thieving it off the baggage claim carousels."
2,Disapointment,"After watching the commercials on TV I thought this game looked great. However After playing it through I was very disappointed. The game didn't look to bad visually, but other than that there isn't a lot to be excited about. The thing that was very annoying was that the aiming  seemed like it was unresponsive even when I put it on the highest setting. The campaign was short and I beat it in under 6 hours. The online multiplayer has an interesting concept in working co-operatively with a partner to complete various objectives, but it's hampered by the slow gameplay. If you really have your heart set on buying this game , I strongly, STRONGLY suggest renting it before hand."
1,Bad experience,"I have pre ordered this console 2 months ago,i received it today,hooked it up to my HDTV,attempted to start the console and bam!! It won't turn on ! Man i am pissed off..this is so annoying.I will be returning this xbone asap and hopefully i will get a replacement before christmas"
5,Great setup!,"I liked this keyboard and mouse combo so much I ordered another for my home office and one for my wife, who also loves it.  The mechanical feel is very satisfying for someone that has to do a lot of typing throughout the day and the mouse is one of the best I have ever used.  I ordered this to replace the keyboard in my home office that can get very dark from time to time (usually at night).  Some reviewer had mentioned that the keys themselves do not light up, just space in between the keys.  That is only partially true.  In a dark environment, the letters and number DO light up, at least enough so that you can read them.  Overall I am glad I switched from my wireless set to this one."
4,Good game- bad DRM,"The game itself is brilliant. However, I feel burned because I ordered a physical disc and it still is considered a lease- even with contradictory statements in the packaging. What the game industry is doing is wrong!"
1,The game is great..,"The game is great... when you play it on a steering wheel. I have a Logitech T150 that is both PS3 and PS4 compatible. We still play burnout on the PS3 when we have a bunch of people over. The kids love it. So you think the remastered version would simply carry over that feature. Wrong. After waiting months for the remaster, we find out that they didn't bother making it for a wheel. The menu options from the PS3 version that control the wheel weren't included on the PS4 version. This is the biggest gaming disappointment of the year."
5,Love the simplicity.,"Easy to apply, no bubbles at all."
2,"Terrible, terrible, terrible",When I bought this game I was so excited.  Like many Nancy Drew fans I thought this game would be an extension of the Herinteractive games that I have come to enjoy and love.  This could not be further from the truth.  I found the game to be very cumbersome.  It is very difficult to move the players and the graphics were primitive.  I found the dialogue between the boys to be annoying and distracting. The Adventure company is going to have to make a lot of improvements before I will buy another Hardy Boys game again.  I think I will stick with Nancy Drew.
5,Works great,Perfect works great thank you so much received when I was told I would thank you
1,From a pocket owner.,"As a analogue, super nt, mega nt, and pocket owner. This is stupid. I've seen better deals on eBay. Tbh it is not worth over paying like this even with openfpga support....."
1,BORING,"This game is not good an any level. Not as a shooter, not as an RPG and not as multiplayer. Don't waste your money."
1,Fake,"Once I opened the device, it was very clear to me that it was fake. What a disappointment. The buttons are all red, and when I looked up online videos of the actual unboxing from factory sealed boxes to check if it was legit, all of the unboxers commented that the buttons were brown to match the pikachu color scheme. I never leave reviews, but I just wanted to warn people out there before they buy. Yes, it does work, but it is not legit."
5,One of my favorite DS games!,"I pre-ordered this game because I love fashion and shopping for myself as well as others.  I began playing it the night that I received it and I have literally spent hours at a time playing this game.  It is so much fun to play.  You begin by working as a sales associate under a manager at a shop.  You then begin to assist customers with their specific needs.  Sometimes they will just come in to browse, need a specific item, want you to make a suggestion or even require a complete ensemble.  After proving yourself as an indemand fashionista you will get the option to run your own shop.  You can chose what your shop looks like, the type of music is played (which I agree with others to say it is lame music), create looks on manequins for your shop window, visit the warehouse to buy garments that you want to add to your stock of merchandise to sell and even enter contests.  Everything that you buy to add to your shop stock is also available in your own closet to wear.  You can change your clothes and also visit the salon or cosmetic store to change your look.  This game is rated E for everyone but I don't really see that young kids would have any interest or appreciation in playing this game.  It would more suite teenage and up.  You have to use reasoning skills like paying attention to the type and style of clothes the customer has on as well as what amount they allow for their spending budget to be able to pick out something that they are going to like and will purchase.  I am in my 30's and sometimes they don't even like what I pick out.  I love this game and I would highly recommend it to anyone that has an interest in style and fashion."
5,Bang for buck.,Product works as described.
5,"Perfect for me, right in time for Christmas too.","I was skeptical at first given i thought it was just gonna be a refurbished console, i was sorely mistaken in the best way possible, it came in the original packaging, PLUS the MW 2 bundle. I was very pleasantly surprised and im very satisfied with my purchase."
1,Not the right one! Not for Xbox 360,"Wrong cable!! The description and head line is wrong, the picture is the only thing right.. This is FOR THE ORG XBOX ONLY! Do not buy if you are looking to hook up a Xbox 360!!! I have to return this one now"
5,These pair well and work great,These pair very well with the Wii u. We have had no issues using them and playing with two sets of these.
5,Funciona perfecto!,"El producto es exactamente lo que se describe, es la versión de la batería mejorada. Estoy en Panamá y me llegó en tan solo una semana. Full recomendado."
5,Awesome,These are awesome!.I have very small hands and they easily accommodate me and feels.very secure and comfortable.  Adjustable for different sized hands.
2,Unsatisfied,I bought 2 of these game genies for the fact that they are supposed to work for the nintendo 3ds well once I recieved them and tryed one there was nothing on there for 3ds and no way to get codes for 3ds either U could get them for ds and gameboy but not 3ds and when I contacted the company I got no response so if your looking into this for 3ds forget it it don't work.
4,"This is a modular system, expect modular results","I heard previous reviews saying this wont work with a Warthog, but bought it anyhow. As I expected, you CAN make this work with most throttles and HOTAS systems, but it will require a bit of out-of-the-box thinking and a lot of the bolts that are provided to you. The rails, as many have noted, are too short to actually fit a Warthog throttle on themselves on the brackets, but with various other screws you can secure it in multiple spots to prevent movement. I think I need to adjust a lot of it to make sure things are level, but I can see where others thought bending was occuring, which I currently believe is user-error, as you have to make sure your mounts are level to secure a not bent connection. They seem to mount to my desk without issue and I wanted to provide a few examples of how I did for future purchasers. I may not recommend this if you have a Warthog throttle, but I can see it CAN work if you want it to."
5,Street Fighter's 3D sequel,"From all the fighting video games around Street Fighter has always been the mother of all.From it's beginning it has been a game who deserves admiration and if it did good as a 2D game it did way better as 3D.This game gives us the opportunity to enjoy SF even more with a lot new things such as great graphic,combos that will blow your mind,lots of new options and lots of characters to chose from.It brings us a whole new SF with the same stuffs we like.Old characters in their 3D version which is just perfect and a whole new cast all with their uniques techniques.This game has new options never seen before in any other SF game.The arcade,versus,Team,ect,modes are all new and better.This game offers you a great deal of exitement as you spend more time playing it.By far,one of the most revolutionary and why not controversial among fans from all the SF games.Buy it,play it for 2 or 4 hours and I guarantee you this game got nothing to envy other SF games."
5,This is a cool game.,"This game is awsome.  I found out that it works better when the color setting is on 16 bit mode 400 X 600 pixels.  When on this setting, the movies won't be as choppy.  For a walkthrough go to gamefaqs . com."
1,Looks nice but it smells awful.,"The design of the case appears nice, but I will not be able to use it as it reaks of a smell similar to stale cigarettes at a bowling alley. I'm not sure if it was due to how it was stored, or chemicals used in the manufacturing process, but it really reeks."
5,So far it seems pretty good. It has kept my 5 year old ...,So far it seems pretty good.  It has kept my 5 year old occupied on long trips.  The only problem is keeping my wife from playing it.  We both grew up with these games.  Good stuff.
4,Worth buying in bundle pack!,"This pack is way cheaper if you buy than getting them separately. Not only that but it comes with the free Sim points. This duo expansion pack is very helpful in that you can travel to three there countries, go to your prom, experience no movement for your sims, and more! It may not be the top expansion pack to own, but it certainly helps building your sims world into something much more!"
5,Five Stars,I'm Commander Shepard and this is my favorite Omni Blade on the Citadel.
1,Got old very fast.,I was hoping for alot more from a game Microsoft was pushing so hard for. It's very repetitive. I wouldn't recommend it.
5,Great to play your switch around the house,"This case is great if you like to play your switch around the house and don't want to worry about it getting bumped off a table or getting the back scratched up. The case itself is thin enough to be practical, and the added padding around the controllers makes it comfortable to hold if you have large hands. One downside is the case needs to be removed to fit into the dock (i have both the Nintendo dick and aftermarket docks, neither fit while in the case) not a huge issue as I mostly play the switch in handheld mode. The controllers are also easily removed without taking off the case."
1,"DOA, DOA, RROD,,Why again?","DOA, DOA, RROD, Why microsoft always make low quality product. I had to go thru 5 360s. Now this crap came out again. Will return to Walmart tomorrow."
2,"Great product for the price, but does have a time limit","I will admit, it worked great for me! It played all my SNES games and with a much better picture and sound. What did not work was the two-player feature. Each time we place a second controller for two-player mode, the game would freeze and only the ""A"" button would work. When contacting the company, they advised that they could not help and stated that they had only a 90-day warranty. A 90-day warranty and I only had my system for 13 days."
5,WORKS WITH THE PS4 PERFECTLY,I bought an LP1 and it works for it. But the best part of it.....IT WORKS FOR THE PS4!!  You just plug the top to the headphones and the bottom to the controller and bam! Headset for ps4 with an amazing sound!  Soon I will upgrade to the M-100 but for now this works amazing and I can listen to music after I game :)
2,"It's ok as long as you dont have any expectations of it, such as finishing the game.",It is nothing like years 1-4. You dont use the touch screen at all and it glitches. I had no idea what I was doing when I started the game. Like I said it is nothing like the first one. My biggest problem is the fact that it blacks out when I am fighting Valdimort and does not come back. I have to start all over again on that level. I would give it a better score but cant when I cant finish the game.
5,From DualShock 4 to G3w,"So I had already bought a DualShock 4 controller and jumped through the hoops to get it to work with the right software. I loved it but the only two problems I had were, the usb charging cable going into the computer (don't have a bluetooth motherboard or pcie card) would loosen over time and in the middle of play the controller would disconnect. Also from time to time due to the conflicting xbox 360 controller drivers were fighting DS4Windows (the driver program the shows the DualShock 4 as an Xbox 360 controller) the controller would disconnect and then not even be recognized, so my quick fix was to disable the controller from Devices and unplug and re-plug. So I  reluctantly purchased this thinking that I already bought the DS4 controller why would a cheaper controller meet or exceed my expectations. Well it absolutely exceeded everything I thought it was going to be. For starters it plugs right into the PC like an XB controller so no need to fuss with programs and setting up layout or needing to download extra software. The joysticks are more sensitive (which is a problem I had with the XB360 controller) than even the DS4 and I was already pleased with the response, but now I have an even more responsive controller.  It fits in my hands even better than the DS4 and I started gaming on an original Playstation, so they have always been my preference. The G3w is also lighter because it doesn't have a battery in it, small plus but it's the little things. So for the price of a DS4 I could've got 2 of these. Wish I did."
1,No Co op for Split Screen.. DO NOT WANT,Wanted this to play with my son on our tv at home like the last 10 years of Halo.  Soooooo disappointed.  No co op split screen.  Will return.
1,Fake product,Product is a fake. Received a memory card adapter w no game. Would give this zero stars if possible.
5,Truly Awesome,"Forgotten Battles (FB) is truly awesome with its amazingly realistic graphics. The detail to aircraft (including cockpit interior)will delight the WWII buff and the sunlight effects are stunning and realistic. You can zoom in and out, and have internal and external views. You will however, need to ensure your computer and graphics card can handle the requirements of the game. The flight model can be adjusted to suit ones own individual skill or pleasure levels. Pilot career campaigns can be created from a whole range aircraft including Stuka, Heinkel 111, ME109, IL2, I16, MIGs etc, although these aircraft could be upgraded during the pilots career. Once you start to amass a tally, the game has you going back for more to increase your tally. Many variety of aircraft can be encountered, including Gladiators, P40 Kittyhawks, P39 Airacobras, JU88s etc. In the midst of combat on bomber aircraft you can take up the postion of gunners and attempt to shoot down marauding fighters. My only gripe is that there is no strategic element to the game and there is no way you can influence the outcome of the war, but then again the air war on the Eastern Front was almost entirely a tactical affair. Perhaps the creators of the game will have a strategic element in the proposed Battle of Britain game. The FB game includes a Quick Mission builder and a Full Mission Builder. The game will certainly provide many hours of enjoyment."
1,Recertified product not new.,"The product itself is good, much better than my old keyboard. My only problem is that it came in a recertified box and not new. That should be listed in the description period."
1,Huge disappointment,"Crashed twice the first hour, textures dont load, combat is jank. Embarrassing that a company can release a broken product after 8 years of development and 3 delays. Maybe shouldve spent more money on making a good game and less on a big marketing campaign."
5,Great bang for your buck,"Friends haven't had any issues with my mic creating echo or feedback, they all seem to be able to hear and understand me perfectly, sound quality is very acceptable, and (most importantly?) they're surprisingly comfortable. Most head phones make my ears pretty sore after 30-45 minutes of wearing them. With these I'm able to sit comfortably in them for 2-3 hours without any issue."
5,I love it,"Look I'm an ex- everquest player, and I hadn't touched a regular video game since the 1st Sega Genenis came out and the arcades went out.  I ordered the Wii for a family present and the people playing it today range in age from 4 to 57  (4, 18, 19, 28, 35, and 57 actually played and loved it) and we all love it so far.  I got several of the games but the wii sports alone that came with it is just really fun.  I have no time to look up game codes and cheats and learn 102 game control combinations to win something but I can have fun with the wii simply because I can use a remote control.  It's just tight :-)"
4,"works well for gaming, not perfect","I was happy to find a pair of headphones with a mic that didn't sound like total garbage. there are two drawbacks, though. 1) they're tighter than I would like. 2) the ear cups are small. I don't have big ears and they still bother me after a while. I wish they had big circular cups instead of oval ones. I wish the padding was thicker, also."
1,Rip Off,"Just buy a flash drive and wear a watch... Bang, you have the same thing"
4,Doesn't enable the resident to move to your island on Switch,Should have done the research before I bought it but I thought if anyone else thought of using these for AC:NH to move residents to your island I thought I'd save you the trouble and let you know that it won't work and since there is no warning in the game about which work and which don't I thought i'd leave a warning.
1,Terrible packaging,Products are good but they damaged the box to put it in a smaller container. What if I had bought this for a collection and was not going to open it.
5,Great charging stand!!,"Husbands loves the ease of this stand plus it provides a safe place for it when not in use.  Very sturdy, well made..  holds unit perfectly.."
1,This listing is pointless,Literally no point having this on here. Just go to the eshop and download it for free.
2,I paid full price for a NEW PS4 and got ...,I paid full price for a NEW PS4 and got a used one with someone's account already on it instead...
1,price!,250 dollars for a 50 dollar controller is just unacceptable.
1,Warning before buying this product,One thing they do not mention is that your wireless phone must have infared or have bluetooth. I did not know this and must now return the product. Make sure your cell is compatible before ordering.
2,Not a long lasting product,I have owned this charger for 2 years now and its all but stopped working. the sweat from your hands rust the charging contacts on the battery pack and after awhile the pack doesnt hold a charge anymore. Looking into a new charging system by Energizer. It had induction charging
5,Great buy,My son is very happy with this keyboard it is everything he hoped for.The way it changes colors is really cool.
4,128mb sounds great! The price is great too,"I was nervous about buying this. I have a lot of ps2 games that I still play and constantly run out of storage space for my save files. The 8mb cards weren't cutting it. So, 128mb sounds great! The price is great too. I was highly concerned because the product ships from China and when it arrived--while it does look like an official Sony product, it's clear that it's not. Actually, there wasn't even a brand name on the packaging and any text such as directions were oddly written or translated. In short, this looks like a knock-off you'd find at an American flea market. I've been duped before with Chinese knock-offs so I took one of the memory cards I purchased apart to see what was inside. Looked much like a standard memory card. I put in Kingdom Hearts and attempted to save game on it. It worked fine. The memory card did read as if it had a lot of storage space too. And after having this product for two weeks, so far nothing has gone wrong (knock on wood). Overall I'm just going to go ahead and say that I'm satisfied. Skepticism aside, it does what I need it to do and given time, I'd probably order another one from this seller should I need more memory storage for my ps2."
5,Sticking to Nintendo products on wheels,Learned my lesson buying knock off wheels. In my defense the Nintendo wheels weren't released yet when buying the other types. I'm hoping we don't break the triggers like the other ones we have. I have 4 of these wheels now and they fit my 5 year old hands well and ours too. He plays almost every night for a little bit as a reward.
1,Romance is meh,"I usually don't rate a game I have played very low like this but honestly Bustafellows was the definition of boring for me. Suddenly when this game got announced, all of the otome community started raving about it and some even compared it to Collar x Malice and how it's so much better done than CxM. THEY ARE WRONG. The mystery in Bustafellows was underwhelming and didn't even excite me enough to consider continuing the story despite major lack in the romance department. The romance is somewhat forced by the end of the routes as there wasn't even hints of the characters starting to have feelings for each other. Lots of repetitive scenes and lots of slice of life dialogs which kept this vn boring as I go through trying to finish it. I would say this is more for those who like Slice of life, family style, and less romance type of players or those who like American TV shows. Sadly, I didn't enjoy it at all."
4,A step in the right direction,"Surfing the internet on your DS.  The Japanese have been able to perform this task for a while now, and finally, we get the DS Browser on our shores.  Like a previous reviewer excellently stated already, the DS Browser is useful, but limited in it's capabilities.  Despite that though, it's still a handy little addition for your DS that is worth picking up.  There are a few different options when it comes to web surfing, most notably being browsing the web with the top screen while using the touch screen as a mouse.  Viewing pages of text is easy enough, but there are some glaring flaws to the Browser.  Most notably being just how limited it is in terms of overall functionality.  Viewing videos is out of the question, as is any sound capabilities from sites you visit.  Those facts aside, the Browser works great otherwise, with the touch screen being excellently formatted it's biggest trait.  Be warned though that you are going to need to find Wi-Fi hotspots to connect, which isn't a problem if you live in the city.  In that case, having the internet on your DS on the go is a nice and welcome sidekick if you need to look up some information quickly.  Though it seems inevitable that Nintendo will update and release better versions of the Browser for the DS in the future, this is a step in the right direction.  All in all, if you're considering picking up the DS Browser, beware what it can do and can't do, and once you've made your peace with that, you'll find it makes a fine addition to Nintendo's powerhouse handheld."
5,Excellent service and resulting product,"Excellent service and resulting product. I sent in 3 films to be digitized. At each step in the process, I received an email letting me know what was going on. Within a couple of weeks, my digitized films were returned. They were beautiful."
5,fritz 13,I received the product quickly and was very satisfied with its performance. It was far better than expected and heads and shoulders over what I had. My game will definitely improve with this remarkable product.
5,Best Mount Available,"This is by far the best mount available for Kinect! It works for TV's of all shapes and sizes, I highly recommend it."
5,Fantastic product,I love this product as it allows me to charge my PS4 controller while playing from my couch. I no longer have to sit 2 feet away to be able to charge my controller. The cable is very high quality.
5,"Fun game, not for youngsters...","Wow, thats for starters, but let me tell you this game will get you frustrated at first but dont give up, you will get it...thats why i say not for youngsters, im 33 and it took me about an hour just to fiure out how to operate Mickey. Wish this was on PS3 or 360, multiplayer would be AWESOME! Maybe next time....Epic Donald, or Epic Goofy! I loved the way they incorporated Disneyland in almost every aspect! I saw the people movers, haunted mansion just to name a few...you will enjoy collecting all the secret stuff that can be found throughout the game too! If you remotely like Disney pick up this game, if you dont even care for Disney, pick up this game, but remember not for kids under 10...too hard and a little dark."
1,I hope you never upgrade your computer...,"Once you buy the game, you can only install it three times.  Ever.  If you get a new computer, there's one install down the tube.  If you so much as uninstall it to make space for a while, that's another install gone.  Use all three and you can never install it again.  Have fun with your rental."
5,Works in Wii U,"Works in Wii U. Just need to go into Wii mode (the system prompts you how to do this) very simple.  Game is fun, brings back memories. It seems original mario's graphics were a bit enhanced for the orig version but seems to be same game play."
5,Best Headset for the Best Price,"I'm sick and tired of people giving bad reviews on this headset.I own a PS3 and I've played COD4 for about 12 days. Many people have horrible mics that echo and make what I call ""the devil screech."" Bluetooth mics create that noice when they pick up background noice. I previously owned a blutooth not knowing about this one. The first problem was it echoed horribly, where as the this product has no echo what so ever. Also charging a blutooth can be a pain and turning it on and off for some can be trouble. When using this product it requires no charging and it is always paired and it is always on. The noise cancelation on this product is great. I usually always have a loud tv on in my house and my friends can't hear it any more since I've switched to the Logitech USB. Also the cord is very long so you don't have to play close to your tv if you don't want to. In short this headset is the most reliable product on the market today for its inexpensive price."
5,Awesome!,"This charging dock is amazing, we could never keep our ps4 controllers charged, it can be used with a wall socket and the design is nice with an led screen to note if they are still charging and when they are done. My husband was so happy!"
5,Great keyboard and mouse,"I love this keyboard and mouse, first this is my first mechanical Keyboard and mouse with RGB."
1,"Not the best game ever, not the best rpg,","Well, look.  play this game.  dont take my word for it, youll be sorly dissappointed by the lack of game.  So rent this game or borrow this game and play it.  I guarantee you, youll agree this game is bad.  the polygons are herondous.  the story is kid friendly, and the whole game is a headache."
2,Directions would have been nice,It came with no directions.
1,Horrible design.,"Was hoping this would work but unfortunately it does not fit the controller like it says. Have tried multiple times to see if maybe I was connecting it  wrong but its not rocket science. Should be simply connect it and bam, it should work. Nope, I was totally fooled. Should've gone to the store and got it there instead, that way I can see them demo it on the controller to be certain that this is what I wanted."
5,"Before, I was skeptical, but now I'm sold","I must admit that what originally brought me to buy these controllers was the lack of availability of the Xbox 360 original controller.  It seems Microsoft stopped producing them.  I purchased a pair of these controllers, with a little skepticism, for less than the price of one original.  I expected them to wear out or break quickly.  I was pleasantly surprised; the look and feel is remarkable, the weight is almost identical, a little more lighter, but all buttons and functions work as the original.  The two thumbsticks have the same grip and they click well, the vibration is great, the ""Xbox"" button works as the original.  Also, the triggers, D-pad and bumpers all have the same feel as the original.  I'm still using one of the two controllers I originally purchased; I gave the other one to my son as a gift and he still uses it.  I purchased a new, single controller during Black Friday to have as a spare.  This should be your replacement Xbox 360 controller; I've had others, but they don't come close to these."
4,Almost perfect,"The HyperX Alloy Elite 2 Mechanical Gaming Keyboard is built like a tank.  Solid construction and craftmanship,  this is by far the brightest key board I own.  The keys are silent with shallow key travel before activation.  Solid keyboard all around I have no complaints with the keyboard , now on to the bad.  The ngenuity software is mediocre at best , with poor implementation as you must download it from Microsoft Store.  My Razer Corsair keyboards do not have this problem at all ,download from their site without having to use your MS account.  You must have the software running in the background if you want to implement a color theme , if you turn off the ngenuity it reverts back to the three default profiles.  You can create three new custom profiles but the software is not user friendly either or intuitive like other vendors.  I would have given this rating a perfect 5 stars but the ngenuity SOFTWARE completely left a sour taste.  If they want to compete with other premium keyboards they need to fix their software."
1,RUINED MY SWITCH,"I should've known better than to buy a Nyko product. Tested fine when I received it, but when i plugged my switch back into my original dock later that day, all i get the is the fast blinking green. Ruined."
5,Solid headset,"I have a small head (youth hats fit me) and these fit ok. My husband has a big head and they adjust to be even bigger than his size,  so we really like that about them. They are comfortable and not hot. Easy to use. Would buy again. They look and feel nicer than everything local I tried on (about 12 pairs).  Used for ps4"
1,"Never worked, my loss your gain.","Item did not charge the DS.  Bought it because the New DS does not come with a charger.  Used brothers for a while.  when on vacation needed to charge both at the same time discovered this one does not work on either the original 3DS or the 'New' 3DS.  Too late to return.  Learn from my experience, spend a few dollars and avoid the hassle."
5,"Well, it's about time a great Mortal Kombat game is released on handheld!!!","This game rocks. I played it on PS2 and I loved it and finally as soon as I heard it was going to be on handheld for the first time ever i thought to myself ""this is great! Much better than those other MKs on GBA and on black and white game boy because the graphics just don't cut it as well and PSP does."" The 3-D is awesome and I have to say I knew it was gonna be great and I was proven right buy purchasing it and playing it to be impressed by it! So all you Mortal Kombat fans out there that own a PSP; GET THIS GAME NOW!!!!! You won't be sorry!!! And it's even better than PS2 because it has extra characters like Shao Kahn, Blaze and Goro!!!"
5,"... to say that the color on this controller is amazing, it is so much better than the solid ...","First off I have to say that the color on this controller is amazing, it is so much better than the solid color versions that Microsoft has put out in the past. The best part about it is that the material they used on this controller feels almost like a silk on the front but has the texturing on the back of the handles so it doesn't slide around. Also I have noticed that for some reason this controller has a longer range when I have it connected to a headset than the older controllers did. As I haven't taken it apart and since Microsoft doesn't say anywhere on the packaging I'm just going to guess that they moved the location of the wireless unit in the controller or upped the power of it. I would definitely recommend this controller if you are thinking about getting it."
5,Wonderful purchase.,I cannot begin to say how much I love this case. Well designed. Does not affect game play at all. And by my picture provided you can see that it dock comfortably. This is a must buy if you want to add some protection to your switch. Thank you to the seller. This is a wonderful product.
4,"This IS NOT Baldur's Gate Dark Alliance, nor was it ever claimed to be...","This is a remastered version of the original PC games BG1 and BG2 for the current gen consoles. It's great. This IS NOT Baldur's Gate Dark Alliance (PS2), as that series was entirely different and wasn't a true roleplaying game anyway."
5,finally makes my ps4 purchase worthwhile,"Despite being a little let down by killzone shadowfall, Infamous Second Son is the ps4 game I've been waiting for. My favorite part is when you suck in a blast shard or smoke and the controller helps make a sucking sound. Good times."
5,thank you Fosmon for making a pretty sweet product,"So let me tell you a few things when receiving this item and before you buy this product as well, It comes very well packaged and in the package you get a little wire thats supposed to connect to the charging port and the wall but you have to get a wall charger separately since it cant plug into the wall with just a usb wire, that being said I took out the batteries and the plastic backing of our controllers knocked those auto charging black whatchyama callits on the back of that sucker and watched the magic happen as they were charging, if I remember correctly either someone in the comments or the directions stated that they had to leave theirs on for an 1 or 2.... but bro I left mine on for about a lil over 30 mins  and whammo the damn thing was working for hours an hours while I was playing Monster Hunter World with my boyfriend, this thing was such an add on to my experience with that game no wires attached yeah!! thank you Fosmon for making a pretty sweet product"
5,Get a grip! A must have accessory,"I ordered these before there were any reviews and was a little nervous about what I'd receive. My fears slipped away the first time I put these in my hands. I'm not a small guy and was afraid these weren't going to work as I've had trouble in the past with such accessories. Not a problem at all here. The way they have an offset design at the top and bottom gave me plenty of room to get the right fit. I really like the way it attaches with the tabs around the controller face and not wrapped around the ring itself. It hasn't budged once. Once they are on, VR just becomes second nature. If you don't have a good set of grips by now, what are you waiting for? Besides a re-stock maybe..."
1,Right wing parade,"This book was a major disapointment' ""you Yankee's"" and ""y'all""...last time I checked, the U.S. military was an arm of the federal government, not the Texas state government."
5,Bowling is a fun sport. and I really like this game it's ...,Bowling is a fun sport. and I really like this game it's a lot of fun
1,NCSoft: not a company to give money to,I would NOT recommend investing your money with any product produced by NCSoft. They do not value their customers!! They put corporate greed above ethical and moral business practice!
4,Thank god SEGA didn't work on this....,"Thank god SEGA didn't work on this game ! They destroyed THOR and I could only hope that they don't rush Captain America and doom it. Overall the game is excellent great weapons,great combat a load of powerups. All the weapons serve a pupose in the game. The game comes with 2 pairs of 3d glasses and it works and makes your gaming experience that much better! Not to long, not to short just rite. The level presentation looks great and so do your enemies. I was sceptical on this release after I played THOR and if your a gamer you know how bad movie games usually are, with a few exceptions ( Batman Arkam, Wolverine, not many) I'm glad I purchased it because I can't stop playing the last 3 days. AWESOME !!!"
2,Seriously Boring,"The SS Collection is bascially three XBOX Arcade games on one disc.  I guess I'm a little disappointed because I sort of expected the developers to make a few upgrades to the games when putting them together in a collection.  Perhaps tweak the graphcs a little or add  a few new enemies.  Unfortunately, they didn't.  I had only played a quick demo of Serious Sam 3 prior to picking up the collection, and it seemed pretty decent as a FPS.  After playing all three games, I just got bored.  From part 1 to 2 to 3, it's all more of the same: mindless shooting.  The first two were particularly boring - even annoying at times.  The same enemies, the same annoying sounds they make, the same mindless shooting.  Part 3 does make some significant improvents over the first two, which is to be expected.  However, at the end of the day you'll still find yourself moving along a linear path, shooting, shooting and shooting (with the occasional swing of a sledgehammer).  I mean, I guess these games are ok for what they are.  If you know you're going to sit down for a few hours of shooting monsters and nothing else, and you're ok with that, then by all means, pick this collection up.  Just don't expect much in terms of content.  I guess I did, which is why I'm not overly impressed."
1,Scarcity,Scarcity Keyword that describes the price an the demand of switches
5,"Ladies and Gentlemen, we have a WINNER !","I had been waiting with baited breath for this, and I cannot reccomend it highly enough. It has the best outdoor graphics I have seen on a PS2 and the levels are HUGE! no little valleys and then loading here... Just one load and you can explore a huge level hunting for deer, moose, even mountain lions and bears. There are little critters like squirrels and raccoons for target practice. The atention to detail is incredible. Leaves fall from the trees in the fall and the animals kick up dust and splash as they run through water ! The vehicles are very easy to control, actually being useful as opposed to a liability. The weapons are great and replicate the real world weapons very well. The fact that the designers included a split screen two player mode is a first for hunting games and is a worthwhile addition. I have a great time playing with my friends, as we hunt down animals in torney mode. The online is astounding. The other hunters appear exactly as you set them up and instead of the weapons just appearing their hands when you change them, the hunter actually reaches back into his pack and gets out the new weapon. Stalking through the woods for a prize buck and then spotting someone 100yds away sighting in on YOUR buck is a real rush as you try and bag it first. The AI on the animals is great and they are hard to kill! The graphics on the animals are great and the trophy room is presented as a museum style with all of your animals presented in brilliant dioramas ! All in all a very polished game and the only one you should get for PS2"
2,Hope You Can Connect To X-Box Live,Didn't know when I bought it that I had to connect to X-Box Live to play chapters 2-5. Total waste of money since I can't do that. Wish it had been spelled out when I purchased it.
5,Delayed delivery but very good overall,"Delivery in damaged, included everything just a day of delayed delivery"
5,Woop!,"This came 3 days after I ordered it when it was said that it would be 17 days! amazing. It came with everything I could ask for. I love both the expansion packs that came, and its really a great deal! 2 games in 1 for the price is 1. Don't have second thoughts."
5,Makes a great gift!,My grown daughter loves these so somehow it's become a tradition that I always get her these for Winter Holiday. I knew she was expecting them last year (this past Winter Holiday) so I surprised her and got her two! One year I got her one big one but was disappointed to find that it was hollow. It's also just not practical to have one giant one lying around for a couple weeks so I always just get her these big packs now. She loves it! I know she looks forward to it every year and I have NO intention of ever disappointing her!
1,Two Stars,Nothing special. Much Smaller than the original VCR Xbox One. The white it ugly. I would suggest sticking with your original or just waiting for the Playstation Neo
1,150.00 bucks and broken...,Left thumb sticks drifts to the the right constantly. And my P buttons on the backside of the controller and miss labled compared to the app for mapping them.
5,Fun game!,"It's short--which I rarely notice so this must be pretty short. However, there are extras and ways to make it longer. I loved this game--in the beginning, every portal is new to you, and while the items aren't all that hard to find, the locations are well-drawn and, since they are in dreams, wonderfully fantastical. After a while you will find yourself returning to the same portals, which can be avoided by playing in bonus mode, which will give you a way to pre-view the portals and avoid the ones you are getting tired of. Bonus mode takes you to the portal of your choice (use the one you know the best, and work your way through those you are familiar with) and you are given 3 hints and a relatively short time to figure out what the hints are talking about, and then find that item. This is where it helps if you are familiar with the items in that portal. That's the only kind of mini-game. You can play timed or relaxed. This may be too short and simplistic for those looking for a real challenge, but if you just want some relaxing game play with some vivid and interesting locations, give this a try!"
5,Problem solved,"My kids kept taking my controller chsrger to charge their tablets and breaking the chargers.  I had to keep replacing them.  I found these and not only are they not a wire,  it charge through a completely different port.  So it can't charge their tablets and they have no reason to take it.  So glad I found a solution to this problem"
1,Waste of Time,would give 0 stars as the product was nothing more then a window telling you that the servers are gone and that the product is dead.
1,They have ruined what used to be a good product,"I'M SO DISAPPOINTED!!! A total waste of time and money. I used to love playing the older versions. Successive versions have gotton worse and worse and this one is just terrible. I loved playing canasta. In this version, the cards are so small, the layout so small that you can't even make out which cards have been laid out. They even changed how the player's hand is viewed, making visually seeing your hand and the number of cards of a suit much harder to identify. I can't even get the discard to work correctly half of the time. If they had just left the old games alone. How can they possibly think this is an improvement? I suspect, like me, the users of these games are older. Do they think we have screen magnifiers that make playing possible? I'm disgusted beyond belief. Unfortunately, the older programs won't load with the new software. All of the changes have been for the worse since the 95 games. They must feel that they have to make changes to justify new versions. Who do they have test these products? Hoyle has gone downhill. It's so bad, it's unplayable. Shame on you Hoyle."
1,Worst seller,"Received this product and it came with a dent in the shell. Then it worked for a week, but now it will not charge. I have attempted to contact the seller, Rock 30 Games, but no answer. I understand that it is refurbished so I lived with the dent, but if you refurbish it the battery should be replaced as it is the main issue with these systems. Do NOT buy from this seller unless you want to be screwed out of your money!"
4,"Good, but not the best","I have both the Pelican G3 and Nintendo Wavebird. The Pelican is a great value for wireless controller. It does have flaws though. First, Pelican's construction is not as solid as the Wavebird. Secondly, and more importantly, the Pelican does not give you the accurate control you need in some games. The Pelican's analog control stick is kind of rough, not refined. If you play Zelda, Top Gun, you definitely want the Wavebird. If you play Harvest Moon of Pikman, the Pelican will be fine."
5,Very cool...,Cool.  Charging pad is a nice plus.  Easy - plug and play.
1,Does not support charging standalone battery,I have one controller. This unit came with two batteries. I wanted to charge both batteries (one installed into the controller and the other not) at the same time. Unit does not seem to support charging a battery outside of the controller. I need to charge one battery at a time using the controller to hold the battery in place on the charging unit.
5,I like it,"The letters don't light up, so it's not for gaming. I'm using it at work though, so it's fine. It is extremely loud when you're typing. I feel that is a small price to pay for such a cute keyboard. It really brightens up my drab cubicle. I'll update my review if I have any issues with it in the future, but so far so good!"
5,Amazing for an off brand product,"We absolutely love them. The only thing we have to gripe about is that the ""X"" button on the blue controller is lower than all the others, but that's it. The snap back and rumble are perfect."
5,Not your kid's video game...,"If you want a game that takes you by the hand and leads you to its finish, do not buy this game. If you are looking for instant gratification and a game you can complete in a couple of days worth of 15 minute sessions, do NOT buy this game. If you are easily frustrated and don't want to invest time with economics, strategy and long range goals, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. If you ARE looking to lose some sleep planning your empire, building fleets and the logistic means to support them, exploring a huge galaxy with many races and many paths to victory, being an industrialist, a pirate, a simple explorer or all of the above then check this game out. You won't be disappointed."
5,Perfect for gaming!,"I bought this for my son to use with his Nintendo. He loves the fit and comfort, the sound quality is great and the microphone is perfect for connecting with his friends.  The noose canceling feature works wonders as he cannot hear me now :)  Highly recommend."
5,Its a game and came in a box,Dumb game but my wife loves it because books and stuff. If you wife loves dumb games then add this to your Hanukkah list now!
2,set came with 5 defective disc,The set as most people know has come with 5 defective discs...i put in request with cbs video to have them shipped and i was PRoMISED by 12-10 ...i called them after not having received them and the cbs rep says they HAVE not been shipped out and there is NO estimated date on when it will happen ..THAT IS TERRIBLE SERVICE FROM A COMPANY THAT ISSUES A  REMASTERED SET ...well i will keep waiting but for now i have to give a bad ratign on this set until the replacement disc are receivd...
5,Best stand!,This stand is amazing! Very sturdy and much better design than the others out there. Incredible shipping!
5,Awesome bundle but....,This is one of the coolest bundle Nintendo has released. The only problem I had was the box arrived slightly bent from the poor packaging it arrived in. The faceplates are awesome and you can always buy new face plates if you grow tired of them. Would definitely recommend.
1,Listen to the other reviewers,This game is so broken. Half the time you cant even select a server. When you select a server you usually cant login to it. If you manage to login it forces you into a tutorial and then tutorial breaks so that you cant do anything.
4,"I'm not a fan of Broadway musicals, but....","This was the first CD I've purchased in probably 10 years.  My wife saw the show and can't get enough of the content.  She's listened to it dozens of times.  I appreciate that it is, for the most part, historically accurate...even if it had to skip over some elements of the story due to time limits.  Included with the CD are all of the lyrics, which I had trouble understanding at the speed with which they are delivered.  This is an epic musical worthy of everyone to enjoy."
5,Screw final fantasy,"This game beats the WHOLE FF series in every way, shape, and form.  'nuff said"
1,Inaccurate website description and no customer service,The controller soft touch looked good and was comfortable. This controller was advertised as a modded controller. When it showed up there was no instructions or anything about the mods. I went into premium controllerz website and it says there is a small button on back side of controller to activate the mods. My controller had no button. I sent an email to the company about my issue and now it's been 5 days and still no response from them. I tried the controller and it is just stock controller as far as I can tell. I sent it back for a refund.
5,Great gift,easy to use and more versatile than the original dock the switch comes with
5,COD is back after a major fail,So far so good..fun gameplay and campaign is decent.  Some people are hating due to other players actions or because it's the 21st century and you need the internet to play.  My only concern was the comment that internet was required to play single player campaign.... not sure if true because I have internet but if it is then shame in infinity ward and Activision!
5,So much better in person!,"Looks amazing at my work desk. Great conversation starter too! I am a loud typer anyways, so my coworkers were already use to the noise. I would say if you work in a quiet area, you may want to think about it...."
1,Way over piced,Over pricing should be illegal and should be jail time. Its supposed to be 499
1,"""Corrupted Data""","I haven't been able to get this disk to work. Once inserted I was asked to format which it said was completed successfully. I could see the disk and capacity under data management. But anytime I download something I'm unable to open the game afterward and the error says ""Corrupted Data"". This is extremely frustrating after waiting for multiple hours for a hefty download only to have it fail. I'm going to try erasing and formatting the disk one more time but seems like this is going to be a returned item."
5,Keyboard,It was AWSOME!
1,Broken day one unit,I received a broken unit. Seriously having questions about buying electronics online now. When I put a disc in I hear a loud noise a nd the system won't read it. Amazon support was amazing and I should have a replacement tomorrow so hopefully I have better luck.
1,THIS WILL BRICK YOUR CONSOLE.,"any unliscened dock for the nintendo switch WILL brick your console. Do not purchase these, or anything else that is unofficial- despite the price tag. Youll end up 300 dollars- or more- in the hole!"
4,The return of the FPS (First Person Sneaker),"If you have ever played Thief 1 and 2 (or even System Shock 2) by the now dissolved Looking Glass Studios, you owe it to yourself to give this game a try.  The stealth isn't as well done, as the AI seem to converge on your position from all over, even if only one guard is alerted to your presence, plus there is no HUD indicator of how well you're hidden, so sometimes it's a crapshoot.  But the first time I realized I could climb up pipes and walls and tiptoe over the guards' heads, I knew this would be a fun game. Then there's using Blink, good fun. There are always alternate routes, and no kill playthroughs of missions are possible, but are a bit harder, require more planning, and more creeping around in the shadows, and that's a good thing. The game is beautiful in my eyes.  No hyper-realistic textures and models here, but the watercolor-styled textures and wonderfully realized cityscapes, and especially the well done water, shadow, and lighting effects make for a immersive gaming experience, who cares if it's a little bit cartoony. The gameworld really asks to be explored, and rewards you with secrets if you do.  The powers are a blast, and there are many ways to use them to either avoid or dispatch enemies, and they kind of have a Bioshock style to them. It's hard to write about many things without giving away spoilers. Voice acting is well done, and the background stories found among audio files and notes littering the gameworld are sometimes better than the main plot. Overall a fun, immersive game, but I'll dock a star for the inconsistent (and sometimes annoying) AI reponse to the stealth aspects of play."
1,Disappointing,"I played this game once and probably will never play again. If you are struck by nostalgia and buy this game, you will be disappointed as it is nothing like the previous versions."
5,Excellent power station,"I purchase this for my son. Best purchase ever, no more buying batteries it has two battery packs. Great design to power your xbox and charge your controllers at the same time. The green LED lights gives your gaming time an awesome effect when playing in semi dark."
4,More carnage,"If you are a lawsuit happy whacko stay away from this one. It's not for the family, unless you happen to be in the Manson family! This game is a one player, 1st person shooter. There is a cable link option and if you are  lucky enough to have two TVs, two game consols and two game CDs then you  can have some real battles (same goes for the original DOOM)as you blast  your way through violent, disguised communists or declare war on your  playing partner. There are several levels and most get a little tougher as  you finish each level. The music can be turned off to make the setting even  more realistic. Lots of suprises and weapons keep this body count classic  fresh. Nothing like a point blank double barrel shotgun blast to the face  to really make you mad! A great deal at this price for sure."
1,Didn't work,It doesn't work on my TV. Not sure why. I guess its too modern as I'm assuming it'd probably work on a CTV but I can't verify that.
1,Bandai Namco is now censoring this game and not releasing content in North America,Bandai Namco has decided to not release content in North America because it shows too much skin. Do not buy this game. This game is not complete and will never be. There are exclusive DLC items only available to Asia.
5,Nice console for 199.99 Black Friday,"Love it, playing like a god on Spider-Man"
5,Was able to take controller apart and put the board ...,Was able to take controller apart and put the board into a actual Sega Genesis controller for my rasberry pi genisis mini project
1,Over Hyped and under delivers,"Xbox One commercials promised this device would take over your living room. It does not, i find it easier and more accurate to use the controller to do what kinect does. Many games run at xbox 360 resolutions and this device is too expensive. The new kinect allows whispers across your house to be heard and it can read your heart beat. This could get hacked or Microsoft could use this information for advertising and the government is going to love this massive amount of data. You may pay for this console with your privacy. Do yourself a favor and buy a PS4."
1,Not worth the wasted time at this point,Endless server issues make this a completely botched release. Worse than any of them that have occurred so far. If I hadn't bought a few months ago I would chargeback the amount on my credit card.
5,What's more adorable than 5 different pikmin altogether,This amiibo is one of the most charming ones they have ever made. What's more adorable than 5 different pikmin altogether! It's highly detailed and makes a nice display piece on my gaming shelf. Nintendo really is getting better at making them more detailed since the Smash bros. days.
1,I used Stealth Elf and did just fine. I love the game,"There is a known glitch on the Telescope Tower level. I have a 6 year son that loves the game and characters (so do I), but this glitch is very frustrating. Consider completing the level by yourself and use a character with no range attacks. I used Stealth Elf and did just fine. I love the game, but the fact that Activision released a game with out fixing an obvious and known glitch is the reason behind the one star rating."
1,Don't buy,I had the original Kinect Sports and thought this one might be fun.  But after trying out the games I was very disappointed.  It doesn't catch on to your movements in the game very well.  I expected more out of this game and have since gone back to Kinect Sports.  I will wait for better games to come out.
5,ps3 60gb,"i love to have this 60gb Model of the PS3 it allows me to watch DVD,BLUE-RAY and play CD it also allows me to play my ps1 ps2 ps3 games unlike the newer model the 60gb model is the best system ever it also let me use the internet as well like Youtube and Facebook it also free online unlike the xbox 360 paying for xbox live the 60gb ps3 has everything that i need for the price...."
5,Fast shipping and nicely made packaged well,Man this thing is awesome after reading some reviews I was skeptical about buying but I took a chance totally worth it battery life is great it takes a while to charge which is good imo that means a slow charge battery life lasts a good while before having to recharge cooling fans are quite they produce more than enough air to keep system from over heating game case storage works as it should over all good buy battery packs lay flush into battery housing will purchase another soon
1,Not a 2000 battery,Battery is packaged in a 2000mah package battery itself is 1200mah
5,Family game night just got easier. Hours of fun without the fuss.,"Love, love ,love...okay, I haven't played Scrabble yet, but have been playing the rest daily with my son. I hated Risk growing up, because it never made sense, but now, finally I can get into it. Trivial Pursuit is fun and informative, and even playing it daily haven't come across the same question twice yet. And Monopoly, changing the rules to fit how the family plays, great idea. Free parking...here I come. You don't have to have controllers for everyone, you can share. And our Droid Turbo 2s act as controllers as well. And there is no banker sneaking money out of the bank when the other players aren't looking. Lol. Family game night is easier and I don't have to look for missing pieces or dice."
1,"Within the first 5 minutes of playing the 360 version I hated it, was confused","I rated this 1 star because compared to the xbox one version, the xbox 360 version is awful. Within the first 5 minutes of playing the 360 version I hated it, was confused, and utterly disappointed. I had played the xbox one edition with a friend and I understood the game in seconds and was amazed at the quality. It seems to amaze me how the same game can vary so greatly between older and newer xbox's."
1,Price is ridiculous on Amazon!,"Awesome game, love playing the game. This could have any enemy to iy, it's more than a zombie game, but the price here is way too high. Go to the Plaid Hat website and save serious money."
5,Perfect,Works as it should had it for over a year now!
5,Experience some gaming history!,"These are indeed old games, and as such, they don't look anywhere near as good as newer games. However, there are a bunch of classics here that should be experienced by any fan of PC gaming. If you love getting immersed inside a virtual world, practically all these games will deliver the goods. And printed manuals? Almost unheard of these days! If you are a true fan and don't mind tweaking your system a bit to get them running, there are hundreds of hours of fun to be had with this massive collection."
5,Great buy,Very easy to pair with system. Easy to use.
5,Fantastic Lego Game in the Ninjago Universe! Original Story and a Must Buy!,"This is a fantastic title! After all of the other substandard titles that exist around the Ninjago series, this is truly a great game that runs the same line as all of the other fantastic Lego titles that have been made. The benefit here is that the game takes place in the world of Ninjago and is a stand alone story for the series. This is an absolute MUST BUY game for any fan of the series or any fan of the Lego games. This title is truly under the radar and hasn't received the advertising that one might think and many may not have heard of it. Honestly, this is a great game and definitely worth the purchase."
5,Just wow,I played single player and wow awsome game play.  Multi mode everything looks so good.  I saw some people hitting on this game as like the old ones .... well the base of the game is like the old ones thats what works they just fix problems and make it a better game.  Not sure about PS3 but it looks great on PC
5,5 Stars Memory Cards for PS 2,I give these Memory cards 5 stars on how well made they are and how great they work. I would buy this again.
1,Dissapointed,Disappointed
5,Great Product,"Colored Keys, built like a typewriter, what is not to like about this great keyboard."
5,A very unique game,This was one interesting game.  I really enjoyed the idea of playing multiple characters from a single family through two thousand years of history. Each character had different stamina too with some being in poorer health causing them to tire faster than others. This made it interesting in regards to pacing since you had to rest some characters more than others. You also got to see changes made to the family home over the centuries which was also interesting. The game was very thought out. The sanity meter was also a nice touch with your character beginning to hallucinate as his sanity level drops. At times as you play you may even begin to question your own as well. I don't want to give anything away so won't elaborate on that. A very unique game. This is one game that truly deserves a sequel. If you haven't played it you really need to.
1,Pure junk,Sad when u look forward to this for months and get it and it's junk. Ubisoft has lost their mind and think they know what they're doing but don't. Aside from bugs they took away ai companions which made wildlands so good. Require constant internet even for campaign. Microtransactions  out wazoo and a ridiculously complex leveling system where u have to constantly grind for better gear or enemy is unbeatable. So sad they don't know to keep the good things about wildlands
1,"Been there, done that.","It's a shame this has Elder Scrolls in the title, the game feels disjointed, hollow and just a lackluster experience as a result. Save yourself the 60 bucks and buy something else, anything but this game."
1,This game is just not there and it truly makes me sad.,"There is just so much wrong with the game as is. I'm not talking about all the glitches or game mechanics not being up to standard but I'm talking about just the pure fundamentals of this game. It just doesn't work. It's really not fun to play... Ive gave it many hours of gameplay.. Solo and with a group of friends but the game is just so empty feeling. If you wanted a traditional fallout game... The story telling and quests are just not there for this game. Nothing is intresting or motivating to continue playing. If you wanted a multiplayer game this is not it. Every server you join feels as if everyone, the little amount of people per server there is, are each playing a single player game together some how... As you come across other players they simply give you a little wave and continue on there way with few people ever wanting to talk or even team up. For being a insanely passionate fan of bethesda games and specifically fallout games... This one is just not there and it truly makes me sad. I urge people to not buy this game as it is now."
5,Great Addition Your Pokemon Game Collection,"My 11 year old son eagerly awaited the release of this game and saved his birthday money for two months to pay for this game.  He is actually home sick this week with pneumonia and this game has been great for keeping him in bed and resting.  It's full of all his favortie pokemon characters, challenging and fun!  Even my 17 year old was watching him play and said he'd like the game too!"
4,Four Stars,"Great game. Has some issues as all games do, but it's still Mass Effect."
1,not a snug fit,"Ok, I bought an energizer charging station, and it came with these rechargeable batteries.  While the charger charged them sufficiently, the batteries don't fit exactly right in the controller.  They fit fine for playing wii sports tennis or super smash brother brawl, sure, but I recently bought punchout, and everytime I got knocked down, I would shake the controllers to get up and lose connection.  The batters would shift slightly in the controller.  Regular double a's and the stock battery cover worked fine.  We noticed that if we folded a piece of paper and slid in behind the battery in the wiimote it produced a more snug fit and had less interruption, although they still existed.  I am on my way to return the charging station.  Paying for AA batteries beats the frustration of losing connection."
1,House restrictions for local coop,"Local coop is a disaster.  Tether to primary leader, only person who first set up account gets to complete missions. Can't refund in any capacity. Waste of money and time.  Was really hoping for a fun game with my significant other. Also very frustrating how long it took to discover all of that."
1,always online requirement,"Always online is an awful thing to ask of your customers, Mazis. DO NOT BUY THE 2013 VERSION OF SIMCITY OR THESE ADD-ONS."
5,"Nobody gets rid of stubborn mildew stains and black heel marks as well as you do, Roger Wilco!","Space Quest IV was the first adventure game that I ever played. It introduced me to a world where games were more about story and brain bending puzzles than run-and-gun style gameplay. Space Quest is a funny science fiction adventure game series that lampoons popular film and television series, such as Star Trek and Star Wars. If you are a fan of those things, you will fall out of your chair laughing. Highlights of the series include Space Quest III: The Pirates of Pestulon and Space Quest IV: Roger Wilco and the Time Rippers. The Space Quest series may end with Space Quest 6, but the two guys that started it all, Mark Crowe and Scott Murphy, are back for new adventure games. Support the revival of a genre: tgakick.com"
2,Ouch.,"Works fine. Good mic. Ok sound. But even the smallest ear bud attachments KILL your ears. They used a rubber or silicone that isn't soft enough. Ears hurt after 10 minutes of use. They are also not noise canceling earbuds so not very effective at, say, hearing enemy footsteps in-game."
2,epic fail,have to agree with most. the ending just ruined the game. also i hate to say it but i thought it was below par compared to ME2 overall. it felt rushed and incomplete all around. compared to me and me2 this was just a total bust for me.
1,Keep in mind when purchasing that this is not a ...,Keep in mind when purchasing that this is not a nintendo made controller. It is made by a third party knock off.
5,fun experience. Not looking for a life changing event,"Sure it had flaws,  but it was an entertaining,  fun experience.  Not looking for a life changing event."
1,Not for Gameboy Advance SP,"Advert says works for all Gameboys including Gameboy Advance; unfortunately, does NOT work with Gameboy Advance SP, just as another reviewer noted.  Misleading advertising."
5,"Not just great for the price, but any price.","Substantial and sure-footed, I'm impressed with this stand in any price range. Nice heavy steel with stay-put joints, this won't tip over. There's a removable neoprene pad on the back to keep your phone or tablet from unnecessary contact with the back of your device. The base is sturdy with rubber feet. If I had to pick something negative about the stand? I'd like to see the base weigh 3 lbs. All in all, it's a great stand."
1,A Brunswick Bowling (joke) game that doesn't use the famed Kinnect system.,"I can not believe Brunswick made a xbox one generation bowling game that does not use the kinnect system!! I demand my money back. The 360 version used kinnect why not this game!! I am so disappointed.  I had heard, new pin physics , real bowlers use to improve game, etc. etc. . How could I  believe that you couldn't get up there and bowl like in just about every other bowling game I had ever played. How do I get in contact with these people to get my money back .  I mean, they should be ashamed .  Are you telling me they are going to have an upgrade.  Could someone tell me how to find a serious bowling game that uses kinnect (besides Kinnect sports Rivals, which is a joke ).  Man I was so excited to get a game completely devoted to bowling and then found out it was controller use only."
5,My granddaughter was very pleased.,My granddaughter enjoyed her gift very much
5,This game deserves recognition!,"The art, the music, the core gameplay, and the level design in this game deserve recognition and applause! Me and my friends were playing this game together and we were always laughing! We enjoyed this game so much! I originally rented this game from Gamefly now I decided to own this game just to give my contribution to the studio. I feel like I haven't enjoyed a coop game like this for a long time! This is not those split screen coop experience you have in call of duty games, instead, this game provides the pure old school fun time when you have a friend over playing a game together and laughing."
1,Doesn't work.,"Says PS5 upgrade available on box, but does not work on PS5."
1,DOA!!!!,"I wish I could give 0 stars!!!!  Mine was DOA.  Opened the box, plugged it in, blue pulsing light, won't display a picture.  Sony screwed this launch up big time."
1,One Star,This game seems like it was made for horny teenagers by horny teenagers.
2,Does not fit on G27,Plug end sticks out not letting it sit flush.
5,Perfect for the nighttime gamer,"I really like this keyboard, it is fairly quiet to type on and the back lighting is present without being overly blinding. You can select the colors that you prefer and the intensity of the lighting.  My biggest concern was that in the picture it shows a European keyboard instead of an american one, don't worry, you won't have umlauts and other weird characters on your keyboard. The only issue I have had with the keyboard was that the wrist rest was a bit too bulky, but it comes right off so if you don't want to use it it's a simple fix."
5,Great solution to disposable batteries,"I purchased this rechargeable battery pack and charger kit as a alternative to replacing and throwing  batteries away all the time. This comes with 2 batteries so I can always have a battery pack fully charged and ready to go. These packs seem to last longer than standard AA batteries (I usually use Duracell procell). A suggestion for anyone buying a battery pack like this that can charge by plugging it into the Xbox directly is to make sure you have your Xbox configured to supply power to charge accessories even if it is powered down or you can plug it into almost standard USB port that provides power such as a cell phone charger, computer etc."
1,Disgruntled Customer,"This is a review of the install process. I haven't even played the game yet. I bought the PC Version of Far Cry 2 at 12pm on Oct 22, and have tried to activate online multiple times since then with no success. I entered the correct cd key, and activation failed. When I spoke to a Ubisoft Tech Rep, he told me that the activation servers were experiencing problems and would be down for at least an hour. That conversation took place at 1pm, and its now 3pm with no successful activation yet. Is it too much to ask that if companies insist on DRM that the servers to process the online activations of products already paid for are up and running on release day? Would return this game if it were possible. Should have just pirated it like my friends. Consumer support of this quality should be appropriately rewarded."
5,Great ! BUTwith problems,"this game is the top of the list of great games out there, however, Valve should use another format than STEAM (the online set-up program).  All who buy this Half Life 2 will need to log in to steam to be able to use the game. And steam has problems that will disallusion most players. Ie. you must log in using your internet system.  For most this means having an IE connection all the while you play the game even though they say you can go off line and play. not true!  But that aside the game is truly top notch.."
5,"Small on the outside, bigger on the inside",It looks fairly small at first glance but I was able to fit my 2 3DS plus the same case for game cartridges it includes. It has some out of the view pockets as welk that I like very much.
1,Useless device,"Does not work under normal lighting conditions. Is unpredictable and unreliable. This device is definitely NOT a replacement for a mouse or keyboard. It is ergonomically painful to use, especially that they have reliability issues. I think that 80 dollars is actually a lot of money for delivering a toy that mostly does not work. All the apps are ridiculously expensive. What a mess. This is nothing like the video that they have advertised. Frankly, they give the entire HMI industry a bad rep with such a bad rollout. People are going to be hesitant to put their money in such a technology again."
4,Value for price nice color scheme,"This is relatively quiet, and has nice colors.  Figured out how to set up my custom colors and I like the keyboard size.  The space bar does stick at times, for no reason I can discern.  All the other keys work ok.  I like that it has the ability to press a button and go right into email or internet or music.  I cannot figure out how to jump only one song to next song, it skips and goes to multiple and skips back around. I wish I could make the lights brighter, I have it set at most bright, but its still relatively muted.  Maybe in the next model they will make the lights brighter."
5,Energizer rechargeable battery,These are exactly what you need for the ENERGIZER stand-up rechargeable Wii remote replacement battery pack. They are used in the Energizer recharging station that cradles two remotes in an upright holder. They ship a rear panel cover in white with the white battery. These batteries needed to be charged out of the box. These ARE NOT what you want for the lay-down induction type chargers. I ordered one to be sure it was what I needed and and getting a couple more back-ups.
5,Astro A40 Halo 5 Guardians is the way to go!!!,"Amazing and beautiful headset, not batteries required plus it sounds great and is what to expect from Astro. I Did take the time to use with my computer and it sounded amazing. I compared to my old turtle beach headset with was horrible. Astro A40 have a 3.5 jack cable to connect to your computer plus the MixAmp for the Xbox One controller.The package looks great.I was going to order the Halo Master Chief  A50, but decided to go with A40 Halo 5 guardians due to design and color with I believe is more appealing. You won't regret it. I will update this review later with more information about use, as this is my first Astro headset."
1,Price Gouging,"I can't in good conscience give a good review for what is essentially price gouging by Nintendo. Not only is the dock simple and cheaply made, it's not an extraordinarily complex feat: merging hdmi input and power input into usb-c. WOW amazing. not really. not 90 dollars really. This is a way for nintendo to gouge even more money out of the consumer after they have bought enough controllers and cases. Despicable."
5,I like it,The back lights are not as bright as I wanted them to be I work in the dark I really wanted to see it glow while I was working. The keyboard it self is a perfect size for me the charging light never comes on but that is ok. Over all I would buy another one for my home location
5,Good quality,Good charger was impress for the price
5,"So Far, So Good.","Cover fits perfectly on the OLED and inside the case.  Only had it for a few days, so far - so good."
1,Huge disappointment. Won't play this game ever,No co-op split screen? So much for family time around the Xbox. Huge disappointment. Won't play this game ever.
5,But overall it was a great product there are a few other skins available on ...,So I'm going to give my honest opinion unlike these other people who actually were given it for free to write a review. The product installation was a little confusing as far as figuring it out as to which piece goes where. But overall it was a great product there are a few other skins available on amazon.com. but for the quality and price I would rate this company a 10 out of 10 for an overall well-designed product that they make. But they should make the packaging for the shipping a little bit more secure and durable because when I received it it was a little bit bent.
5,Great for my extra set,The main reason I ordered these were because I needed an extra set for when I play games with my friends.  I am so satisfied with this product and I feel they work just as well as the original set that came with my switch.  I had no connection issues and controllers work like a charm.
5,Works great!!!!!,Fits my Note 10! Great for games on my phone!
5,Even better than the first game,Smoother UI than Q1 with QoL improvements as well
2,Poor ending turns role playing game into first person shooter,"Side missions are improved over ME2 as they are each unique adventures with different environments and objectives.  And its fun too to see your war assets get ""updated"" with actions and decisions you've made in the game.  However, other than the war asset updates, your decisions currently do not effect the outcome of the game.  Let the council die in ME1.  Destroy the Geth or don't.  Max out your war assests or attack with the minimum.  Makes no difference in the end.  You are faced with the same few choices in the end with the exact same outcome in every case.  In effect, this is a first person shooter, but its a very good one.  The cut scene for the final space battle was incredible, and the final land battle where you had to fight your way to your final objective was really well done.  Still, this was not why I bought ME3.  I considered it a role playing game where my decisions mattered and they currently don't.  I would recommend not buying the game until after Bioware creates the extended ending as promised."
1,I recommend not purchasing from Amazon and just getting it from ...,Purchased the game because it was at a low price.  Posted the news on the Steam forums.  Got a response from the developer that its a pirated version.  They are working with Amazon on pulling it down.  I recommend not purchasing from Amazon and just getting it from Steam or someone of similar caliber
2,Doesn't work with every game properly,Doesn't work for Tetris. It just drops them fast in the wrong place.
1,"Damn, you got me.","Nope, wasted time and money on this. The lettering on the keys themselves do not light up so even in dark situations it's just a pretty light show underneath your keys. The mechanics of the keys feel mushie and wonky. Type and the first letter or two aren't there. And the mouse is laggy and unresponsive at times. In all my years of computer experience and having different periphials this left me feeling like another sucker for reviews. Just goes to show, if you're looking for a gaming keyboard and mouse don't skimp and never trust the hype of reviews when it's too good to be true. Two things though, the mousepad is awesome and the packaging was top of the line."
1,JUNK CONTROLLER WITH A LIFE SPAN OF A FRUIT FLY,"i don't like giving bad reviews but in this case, it's a public service announcement. bought two of these controllers; first one lasted 48hrs and the second lasted a little over a week. in both cases, the floating d-pad broke off which after careful inspection is held by a cheap plastic hinge and there's no way it can be fixed. save your hard earned money and look elsewhere. when the controller worked for that very short period of time, it was very good but the quality is WAY below madcatz. don't buy the madcatz fightpad either, it won't last more than a few weeks. just get an arcade stick and swap out the parts with japanese sanwa denshi."
1,Parents Beware Before Purchasing.,"Don't make my mistake. I am a parent that knows very little about x box. I bought this game for my son's birthday thinking he could put it in his preowned xbox that he got from a friend. I did not know that he had to have an ongoing online monthly subscription to play which we can not afford at this time. Now because the game has been opened, we can not return it. We have lost money. There should have warning labels before purchasing this game that xbox live was needed or you can not play the game. Thank you xbox for ruining my son's birthday! He now has a game he can do nothing with! :("
5,This is the best!!!!,"This is way better than the other ps3's. It is a lot cheaper. It has a better hard drive and it looks a lot nicer. It is smaller and lighter. It also kept all the other features of the ps3 except for the on and eject buttons which doesn't affect anything. The controllers are still great(dual-shock 3's). It has great games and it processes games quicker. This is the system you want it is fast, reliable, and looks good. Buy it and you won't be dissapointed."
1,One Star,Received the wrong Corrin.
1,Scam,650 bucks even tho a switch plus Mario is 360 bucks
5,Great controller,"This is probably the most comfortably designed controller I've ever held. The buttons are nice and big and feel great to press, the weight is good, the sticks feel great, like all Nintendo analog sticks do. HD rumble and motion controls work fine and battery life is worlds ahead of the PS4 controller. The D-pad is a step down from typically Nintendo design though, having no ball underneath the center, so every direction can be pushed in at once, which can occasionally cause problems, but I've played a ton of Tetris and shovel Knight with it and it's still pretty solid. The erganomics are stellar though, to be sure. Feels better than any other controller that I can think of and I think the Xbox one S controller is pretty top notch comfort-wise. Also, with the right Bluetooth controller adapter it can be used on the PS3 and aside from the six axis crap not being present it works perfectly. I blasted through a good portion of uncharted with it just to test it. I bought mine used too which I'm normally leery of, but it's really study and I've had no issues at all. I love it."
5,I was doubtful.. but THIS WORKS!,"Of course, as everyone here knows.. the Quest is a fabulous piece of hardware... that happens to weigh a bit and land all on your cheek bones. This strap SECURELY and EASILY attaches to the existing straps of the Quest and it adds padding, which makes the straps more comfortable.. but the padding also secures the back of the straps to the back of your head BETTER so you end up with less of weight on your cheekbones. Was able to play with my son (I'm in CA and he's in OH) for 2 hours with very little raccoon face afterwards! hahahaha. This works! And the price is right... delivery was fast and all was great."
2,Dissapointed,"Ride to hell is one of those bargain bin type of games that covldve been better if the developer had more to spend on it. The graphics and story are what u would normally expect from a low budget title like this and the voice acting is horrible. After reading bad reviews i still decided to give it a chance and for once in my life i wish i hadnt!  Dont make the same mistake, save your money. Thanx for reading."
5,Not for the whiny gamers.,"First off if you're a forty year old gamer that sits in your parents basement and play games all day and night you probably won't like this game. It's not really for you anyway. I am not a gamer but am a huge gi joe fan. And at one time a super collector. It made to look and feel like a combination of comic, cartoon, and a game. And it pulls it off great. And of course people won't like it because it is not aimed at them it is aimed at the fans who have always wanted to play as cobra commander attacking the uss flagg."
1,One Star,I got the wrong version of Corrin
1,"they only last a few months, then no longer work...wait to review..","Stop's working after a while.. Bought one and about 3 months later it stop's charging the 3DS, bought another expecting it was just a dud... returned the first, now just a few months again.. it won't charge the system.. system new since Dec2017.. So I'm over it, stick with a dud on, even tho the other I was able to return....  I might as well try a cheeper version for double the size... UGH can't anything ever just work..."
1,tackled too much,"This game had a lot of potential, the graphics were good and the concept was good. The implementation leaves something to be desired. It's too monotonous inside the individual stages. I would have rathered 3 stages with more depth than more shallow ones."
5,CÓMPRALOS,"Buscaba algo que pudiera usar sin cables para mi celular y mi laptop y que a la vez tuviera micrófono integrado que fuera barato, fácil de programar, de buena calidad, cómodo para mis orejas, que no pesarán y que su carga y señal fuera de alto alcance. Se que parece mucho para pedir :) Pero estos cumplen con todo."
5,Amazing Couch Co-Op Title,"I got this game specifically to play couch co op and because it looked great. I was blown away by the quality of the game not only for couch co op but for single player. The story, characters, and gameplay are all great. If you're debating whether to buy this game or not I would definitely suggest it!"
5,Looks sweet on my batman ps4,This sticker is pretty cool especially on my batman controller
5,Works with old Wii hand controller,"We have one of the original Wii game set and the rechargeable batteries finally died.  Those batteries are no longer available, so we tried the newer version.  They do fit the old remotes, hold the charge a long time and we are very happy with them.  We may order more batteries for the future since Wii is no longer on the market.  Too bad because as seniors we love  our Wii games and aren't interested in the games for PS, xBox or Nintendo."
1,Does not work! Dont buy!,"Main issue with the mouse is the tracking, every couple minutes it'll just stop tracking, the cursor basically freezes where it's at on the screen, and you have to wait for the mouse to register again, It's been a problem ever since I got the mouse, but it has gotten progressively worse to the point where it's almost unusable. A more recent issue has to do with the scroll wheel not always scrolling, I've tried every cleaning suggestion I found but there is nothing to be cleaned at this point.  Too late to return product."
5,Action Replay Review,"Really cool item. I just bought a new Nintendo 3ds with Pokemon White, Black 2, and Zelda Ocarina of Time. I have only tried using the Action Replay with Pokemon which worked very well."
2,Unstatified quality,I won a Hori Brand Drum for my switch and I highly recommend dumping your money on the Hori brand instead. Sure you'll save some money and i think that's what KMDS is aiming for but overall experience with the KMD is unsatisfying. The feel of the drum top itself is weird. You basically can feel the insides of the drum. The Hori brand on the other hand is a firm flat surface on the drum head and is very responsive. Like I said and trust me. Put the extra money and patience towards the Hori Drum Pad.
1,not worth it,This console costs way too much. I returned this because it wasn't worth the investment. You can't do anything without Live.
5,Puzzle After Puzzle Older Gamers Would Like,"this game is a lot of fun and I think a lot of older DS players will enjoy it.There are four different types of puzzles to play, Up and Down words, Word Roundup, Quick Cross and a new one for me Hidato. Up and Down is fun where you have to choose a word that will tie into the next questions answer. Word roundup is like seek a word except you are given a hint to what the words are such as "" 6 Breeds of Dogs"" you have to find the six....it can get a tad hard..Quick Cross is a fast game where you have to put in 8 words like a corner of a crossword puzzle. Hidat0 is a number game and I must admit I get confused but it is fun and challenging. I am an older DS player, 64, and this is a good game for all of us who like word games. It is very relaxing. Even though you are timed it doesn't give you that rush rush feeling. I play this game every evening when I sit down to relax."
1,Extremely disappointed,"I was unfortunate enough to get a bricked system. It turns on but then the power indicator light simply pulses a blue light over and over again instead of turning white like its supposed to. I've tried contacting Sony all day yesterday and this morning but to no avail. Really disappointed in both their product and lack of customer service especially since I've been loyal to them since the ps1 and have been looking forward to this since I pre-ordered the day after they unveiled the ps4. I've contacted amazon to return it and while i was hoping for a replacement i can only get a refund. but not until sometime next week. So now I've wasted my time requesting off work this whole weekend to end up with no ps4, no help from Sony, and just my money back sometime next week. I'm just incredibly let down by this whole situation."
5,Thank you,Dad loves them
5,Great game,Actually changed my life. My ex wife wants to talk to me again. Thank you crazy chicken shoot!
5,"Fun, historical and overall great game!","Yes you need Age of Empire III and that is because this is an expansion pack, this means you add the levels of this game to the original game.  In anycase this is a great expansion pack and truly adds to the Age of Empires series.  Plus the computer game play is well managed a big plus.  Well worth your money even if you have to buy the base pack."
5,Great charger.,Great charger. Our boys each have a switch and 4 extra remotes.  Now we can keep them all charged up.  Keep in mind the 4 LEDS are bright.
5,Great concept. Very well put together and fun game!,"I pre-ordered my copy of Epic Mickey 2 on Xbox 360 and picked it up today. The graphics are amazing (on the 360 anyways). I was wondering how the gameplay would be compared to using the wii remote to use the brush, but the right joystick on the xbox controller is used to aim the brush. The controls are very simple. I am excited to play co-op. I was excited to see if you could co-op over Xbox live, but unfortunately it is just a local co-op. Another great thing about the game is that the characters actually talk, instead of having to read all of the text boxes in the first game. Overall it is a great game so far!"
1,"Micro-transactions, pay to win","Microtransactions, this is exactly why everyone got upset when forza 5 came out and turn 10 had to make a patch to correct the problem.  No longer do you get more credits for making the game harder by turning off driving assists. You get mod cards like in F6 but this time they have limited number uses.  And like F5 you don't make as many credits per race and there is no longer bouns credits for buying the VIP package.  The game itself is good but this crap makes me wish I hadn't bought it. Shame on you turn 10 and Microsoft for letting such a great game get turned into candy crush."
2,Sorry...but this game is a BIG disappointment.,"I give this game 2 and a half stars. This game is not horrible, but it is a big disappointment and way over-hyped. It could have been made so much better than this. 10 years in the making and this is the best you could do!?!? Seriously...you had 10 YEARS to do this and this is what we get!?!? The story is pretty good but could have been better also. And there could have been so many better choices for the Character Cast! So many Dorks in this game that NEVER should have been in it!!! You skipped out on soooo many better Characters that could of made the game so much better!!! Nintendo screwed this game and opportunity up BIGTIME!!! The action becomes so repetitive at times with the same stupid and repetitive battles over and over again! And it gets so messy when battles and fighting is going on! The controls just stink so bad in this game!!! No smoothness to it whatsoever and the Character Moves and Special Abilities are plain garbage and a JOKE with a cherry on top!!! What a waste of an awesome opportunity that was given to Nintendo and the Game Developers to create a game that could have been so great!!! Its like being told that in 10 years a Beautiful Red Lamborgini is going to pull into your driveway and its all yours!!! Only for that day to come 10 years later and a Beat Up Toyota Corolla with a bra and chrome tips shows up! Hahahahaaaa...no joke, this game is a BIG disappointment! You blew it Nintendo! You really blew it!!!"
5,Nice protector,Loved my nitendo switch look's good
1,Electronic Arts prevents youth from playing.,"This game can be a lot of fun, and younger kids find it quite entertaining. That is, they would if they were allowed to play. Both my children are over the 10yrs requirement of the game; however, they are not allowed to play online, because Electronic Arts prevents children from using their accounts online. So the people EA is marketing this game to are not allowed to play. Do they expect I will create adult accounts for my young kids to use, violating both EA's terms of service and Sony's? It's not clear to me how they anticipate children will be able to play without violating their own policies. It makes me think they are marketing this dishonestly. If you have young kids, and you use parental controls to  guide their activities, then stay away from Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare."
1,Hope you have a lot of wall space for this fathead,Don't waste your time with the Jordan package. The poster is weak and the fathead is a joke. You would think it was a real size fathead but checkout the image attached. Save yourself the cash and get the regular version!
5,Truly a breath of fresh air.,I have not been more excited for any game release since World of Warcraft back in 2004. I played the beta and knew i instantly that this game would be what finally puts my love of WoW to rest. Its truly a breath of fresh air and I love everything about it. The characters are fun to play. My favorite is definitely Mercy. I love the maps and I look forward to future DLCs that are released for Overwatch.
5,Bang for your Buck. Great for Newbies or Collectors.,"Same price for base game but includes a basic guide for newbies and a map. No dlc included but the base game doesn't include one as well. For what comes in this edition you get more for your buck as the base game cost the game yet only comes with the game. This edition comes with the base game(physical), a guide, and a map."
1,Contempt for the customer,"No LAN play, constant anti-piracy harassment. They display incredible contempt for and disregard of the customer."
1,Terrible,"I usually don't get mad at games but this is something else. I like to enjoy games, I almost shattered a controller. This games sucks period"
1,Couldn't possibly power a Genesis,"This AC adapter simply doesn't put out enough power to power a Genesis. I don't have an NES or SNES so I couldn't test those, but some quick research makes me think that it won't work with those either."
5,"The Weirdest, Best Action Game Since Bayonetta","Get this game right now if you want to be blown away by some crazy-cool style, bawdy language, fun combat, addictive gameplay, tons of unlocks, and I could go on and on. The zombies are kind of cool but they are just the dressing on this insanity salad. The first level alone left me so euphoric I was replaying it just to get my score higher and laugh and the hilarious scenarios again. I play a lot of shooters and this is definitely what I needed to clear the palette. Don't listen to the self-proclaimed professional reviewers who ditch this game because it should be ""so much more"". That's like saying Robert Rodriguez's ""Planet Terror"" should be so much more, which is the closest work of art I could say captures the feeling of this game. If you think Lollipop Chainsaw is supposed to be like Ninja Gaiden, God of War, or anything in that vein, you would be mistaken and this game would not be for you. But, I know I'll be playing this one a long time. Thank you Suda51 for taking the risks to bring this masterpiece to the public. We need more games like this."
1,it only took 3 days...,"once i received this wiimote i unpackaged it and set it up for game play, in the middle of my game it started ghosting moves even after being set down for several minutes. now that was just the first day out. three days later it died... it was never miss handeled never dropped and just died. once i called their tech support i was disturbed even further about how rude they were and the fact i could not understand what the lady was saying through her accent."
2,Major bugs,"The gameplay itself is generally good. I've had two bugs that are pretty major.  the quarterback not handing off the ball for a simple run play, like a HB dive. This one has been infuriating as it has cost me games at the one yard line and caused turnovers. It happens pretty regularly. I did just have an issue where a safety wasn't called for the first time. Not sure if this is enough to rate two stars but it's really a huge problem for me. This is the first Madden I have purchased since Madden 15, which I loved, and this is really dissapointing. Especially, since I figured it would be a fix that would come in an update by now."

4,Its taller than original,"Looks alright, stick is slightly taller and is straight compared to the v base the original had"
1,Useless,"Does not work. Returning item. We could only get the sound to come through, and snowy image."
5,Good skin for the price,"Easy to put on, it took just a few minutes. The cut was spot on, you just need to clean it real good before sticking it on there. I even messed up one of the sides and I just pealed it off and re-stuck it on with no problems. It's been a little over a month and it's still good to go."
5,great game,great action game for anime lovers
5,Cómodo y liviano,"El combo perfecto, cómodos de transportar y livianos. La conexión es inmediata. El tamaño es ideal para trabajar cómodo en espacios reducidos ."
1,plastic garbage quality,I got a hyperx aluminum one and its much better. Came with linear keys. Logitech makes them clicky and you have to go out of your way to find them linear. I cant find anyone serious that likes clicky. Not if your a musician like I am. You need quiet keyboards in the studio.
4,Good game,"I really liked Civ III, but there was much room for improvement.  Civ IV was the answer.  I don't know what all the fuss about technical problems was about, because it ran fine on my entry level computer.  I really enjoyed the abolishment of attack and defense values as well as the introduction of colateral damage, which elimintated the ""stack of doom"" that every Civ player dealt with occasionally.  I was disappointed in only a few areas, first and foremost, the relatively small number of Civs and unique units, as they're what make the game interesting.  Also, I was under the impression that it was possible to create a mod using world builder.  Really, the only people who can create mods are computer nerds who are willing to mess around with the Python.  Overall, though I would reccomend this game to anyone who likes turn-based strategy."
5,Great bundle for the price! My son LOVES it!,My son is 5 and loves to play roblox and pretend to be a youtube gamer. I got him this bundle for xmas and its wonderful. The price is great and it comes in a very nice box with a handle. Super easy to set up and use. This bundle was exactly what I was looking for. Love the colors on the mouse and keyboard too!
1,Review Changed - Im Returning It,Constantly having HMD issues after sitting a couple days.  Every time I want to use it I spend an hour trouble shooting.  Not worth the hassle so I returned it.  Ill wait for a better solution.
5,Five Stars,Best console Keyboard and Mouse adapter around.
1,Be Carefull,"As an IT Coordinator and Network Administrator, I feel that I should at least put some kind of warning out about McAfee and Norton. For over a decade, most new computers from companies such as Dell, Gateway, HP, and many other brands have been issued with some form of McAfee or Norton on them. Those of us who have bought these computers in bulk for companies, schools, libraries, corporations, etc., we immediately either remove those and install a better solution or we make a new image and install our own favorite brands. I will say that some protection is better than none. That being said, why would you use a program that will continually pop-up adds, renewal notices, upgrade reminders to such a point as they become worse than the problem they are suppose to protect you from? Many people have dubbed McAfee and Norton as the original malware as they have been doing this practice for years. I am not going to persuade you to buy one company over another. All I ask is that you do your homework and shop around. Just because they come on your new computer does not mean they are the best company to go with. I have used Symantic's solution to get rid of some trojans such as the FBI virus but I will not condone some of the practices they employ to force you to buy their software.  It is hard to ignore that some of the other old favorites such as AVG and Avast have started doing some of the same tactics on their free versions as well. I guess if it works for McAfee and Norton, why shouldn't they cash in as well?  Just my two cents. Take it as you will."
5,customize your controllers,These are a neat little addition to the controller. They are somewhat difficult to line up your first time so I would recommend practicing with one you don't like. They can be reused.
2,Buy at your own risk.,"After reporting a red light of death to the customer service department, a known problem with this system, I waited 3 weeks to receive a replacement box.  Upon turning it on, it showed the same red light of death.  Again I called customer service and returned the box, and for a 2nd time I waited 3 weeks to receive the repaired box.  Today, I received it, and with no surprise, it still had the red light of death upon being turned on.  Calling customer service yet again, I learned from a supervisor it could be the power supply instead of the box, that I need to send them the broken box (again) and the power supply.  Jay, the Customer Service Supervisor, also stated that a power supply is deemed an accessory and that Microsoft policy states customers have to pay to ship those materials themselves.  So, I am out a box and power supply for at least 3 weeks, and will need to pay for the shipping of the parts myself so that they can fix a ""known problem.""  I love the game system, but the service has been less than helpful, each of the 4 times I have needed them to address this same issue.  I recommend a different system if you suspect you might ever need assistance."
1,One Star,"Terrible graphics, choppy frame rate, and uninspiring story....extremely dissapointed"
2,Not rubberized like the original sticks,"The description says ""True rubberized on the top and side improves control and reduces slipping"" however this is not the case. The sticks are hard plastic and textured but there is no rubberized coating like the original sticks that come with the controller. That might be fine for most people but I noticed it immediately and returned the product."
1,Star Wars monotony at its finest...,"I don't understand how DICE created this game after making Battlefield 4. There is wayyyy less content than Battlefield 4, the lack of gun customization is horrific and really dealt a hard blow to my dislike of the game. Plus the gameplay gets boring after a few hours, and I'm not one to usually say this about first person shooters, especially one that holds a AAA game title. I feel as if all the hours spent on development was just in the graphical department, which is cool and all, but without solid gameplay mechanics graphics don't account for much as The Order: 1886 showed us. This could of been a much better game, I wouldn't of minded waiting a few extra months for a better game. I feel ripped off..."
1,"I love Fallout, and I wanted to like this.  Its just trash.","This is a really poor money grab.  No story to speak of, just wandering around killing things for no clear reason other than they are there.  You can build things, but really it just feels like they dumped you in a big empty world with some random internet kiddies and told you to have fun in the sandbox.  Just run free mods for Fallout 4 and skip this one."
1,Just Terrible,"This deserves the lowest rating in product history.  Coming from the worst company in the world it is not surprising, but the SimCity franchise was perhaps my favorite game franchise ever so it is disappointing.  There were the obvious release issues that have been well documented that would drop this down to 3 stars immediately.  Furthermore the game was released on March 5 2013 and on November 5th 2013 I received an email saying that most of the release issues have been fixed...that's 8 months after the release!  So after playing the game very briefly during the epic fail of a release I reluctantly attempted to pick up another city only to find a lot of major issues still remain.  Traffic is still unmanagable and commuting between cities is quite obviously broken.  The number of major bugs in this game just makes me cringe as a developer.  There had to be next to no testing done on the product and very poor product management and development from the onset.  The lack of customer support (fixing the countless bugs listed on the forums), combined with development hours spent creating sponsored buildings is just appalling.  I can come up with no better conclusion that to say the sole purpose of this game was to take a well known, popular franchise (SimCity) and create a game spending as little money in hopes of selling the game based on prior franchise success.  EA has once again lowered the bar and continues to amaze with calamities on epic levels never before seen in the gaming industry.  This will go down in history as one of the worst games ever released.  We will probably end up reading about a landfill filled with copies of the right next to the landfill filled with copies of ET (the Atari game)."
5,DOC Fan,I will never get tired of the game. DOC is my favorite game. Its sweet because i get to use my favorite character from FF7. The graphics is cool and modifying my own weapons is sweet. If you are a FF7 fan you will like it.
1,Don't buy it,"It require Japan ip to login,  you have to buy Japanese proxy in addition. What's more, it is not free after first month, more important is it is hard to find a place to buy a card to recharge in U.S."
5,Fun game!,"I play this with my 6 year old grandson and he adores the game.  It's a fun game and it's nice to be able to play the game with him.  It's easy enough for him to be able to play yet complex enough to keep me happy,...the best of all worlds when it comes to a video game."
2,"Fun game, the storyline tries to normalize homosexuality tho. Wouldn't recommend.","My daughter loves horses and all the fun things to do on the horse ranch but was mortified that in the storyline there is a quest or task to take a kitten to a man with a husband named Richard. I feel normalizing homosexuality shouldn't be a part of this game's agenda. Quite upset they would write that in there. I don't discriminate against homosexuality, in fact I know many in my close circle that struggle with same sex attraction, but a video game geared toward children subtly putting in a plug in favor of it being normal was just a no for me. Don't buy."
5,Christmas gift purchase,"Grandchildren each have a Ninetendo Switch but only one charger.  At Christmas they will have two, one for each.  Easy to charge, kids can do it by themself.  Easy to take along so their Switch is always ready."
5,So much fun,"So much fun, a cut above the rest for search and find games.  You can choose to time yourself or not.  Very cute graphics"
1,I didn't do a ton of research so I was very disappointed when I realized there was no story line to ...,I had incredible expectations for this game. I didn't do a ton of research so I was very disappointed when I realized there was no story line to the game. I wanted to have the full star wars experience. The multiplayer feels the same in every type of mode. It turns into a slow paced team death match where there is little strategy and mainly just shooting. It truly feels like I'm playing COD on a Nintendo 64. I really hope they don't make me pay for future DLC to make the game better. I think they needed to release this video game just to keep up with the star wars hype and I fell for it.
2,It just needed a little more challenge,"Like other reviewers, I was very happy to see the Sonic of my youth back. Secret Rings, Shadow the Hedgehog, etc. almost ruined the whole series of games for me. In this game I saw a return to the worlds and play that first captured my heart back in the sega genesis days. The problem is, there wasn't much to it. The levels were fairly easy to beat, even my 7 year old son was able to master the game in less than a week. I don't mind the somewhat week storyline, that's not the reason to play Sonic anyway. I mind that I beat the game so quickly and so easily that I feel ripped off. It just left me wanting more."
5,"Not really that large, perfect for GBA.","Intec made an awesome case here. The SP fits in snugly with the ability to put about 3 more games inside. The hard shell protects the GBA from all the abuse you can hand out, without compromising the contents inside. It is a bit bigger then the smallest GBA case out there, but it still fits in the palm of your hand. I keep my GBA in my school backpack for my time between college classes. I have some heavy books, and this has protected it, and gotten through it not too badly. Definitely pick it up!"
5,Great Gameplay and Addictive...,"I am not a big fan of racers. I liked Grand Turismo 3 on PS2 but was not overly impressed... if you are looking for a game that gets your attention quickly and everyone can play without having to know what kind of tires your car needs, this is a great game. So many cars to choose from, beautiful graphics (MUCH BETTER THAN GT3 on PS2) and some awesome tracks. I especially love driving the boxter trough san francisco!"
5,long awaited.,It was a long time coming on disk for someone who played the original a long time ago and does not want to download games.It was worth it.
5,Worked well for replacement on our Wii U...,"I purchased these as replacements for our Wii U controller. An easy plug and play fix for the ones that had worn out. Didn't take long to install and we were up and running without issue. We've got more than 15 hours on the new parts so far. Works great! If you found this review Helpful, please check YES. Much appreciated."
5,Pretty impressive set of head phones.,"These things are pretty awesome. I had Astro a40s then a50s for a while and I got these and noticed some sound differences right away. Didn't like it at first. After about a week I tried my astros again, and in comparison they sound terrible. These things are pretty awesome. The noise cancelling is amazing. Can't hear anything, which is unfortunately why I may have to return them and get some open back head phones (have small kids), but if you don't want to hear anything around you buy these. I'm very impressed by the quality of these."
4,"Good gameplay, old engine.","Might and Magic VIII is a solid addition to this series. Yes, the engine is very dated, but fans of this series will not be too put off by this. The new playable races in this installment are a nice touch, although I would  say that with a dragon in your party you have a big advantage. This is  because it's basic flame attack uses no spell points and does a lot of  damage. The dungeons in this game are not as huge as MM6, which in my  opinion is just fine. While MM6 was a superior game, the dungeons did grow  tiresome. Overall, this was an enjoyable game, worth the money it costs and  I would recommend it to any fan of this series, as long as they can look  past the dated graphics."
5,Great Multiplayer - Good to see some studios still offering LAN support!,"First off I am always looking for games I can play with my fiance. We've been through diablo, d2, starcraft, guild wars, gears series - so having a rpg that offers LAN support was a big purchasing factor. And it really delivers. Hooking up additional players is very easy, stable connection and great speed. The game is well designed, on the highest video settings it is a highly detailed world. Challenging, plus I love how it allows for team work... he keeps monsters off of me while I snipe at far off archers. It's a wonderful game for a couple or even friends looking for a co-op. It reminds me of a darker version of oblivion, which was exactly what I was hoping for. Ok it doesn't have the interaction with npc's like oblivion or dragon age would offer. But the fact that it brings interaction between co-op players is what makes it special. This is not meant for a lone player. You will have max fun by including someone else real. And also being able to play E'lara rather then stuck with playing Dom in regards to gears is a really big perk for me as a girl gamer. To summize, it's a fun game meant to be shared with friends, each person does need a copy of the game in order to play but no serial numbers to deal with. If you buy this game and have a friend to play with, you won't be dissappointed."
5,feels nice and well made.,I bought this solely for my raspberry pi 3b game system and it works decidedly better than the Bluetooth it's basically plug and play.
5,Awesome,"Some think that great games like nfl2k1 take up a lot of memory but with  this baby, u'll never need another memory card again.  i had one for n64  adn it was great, and the dreamcast will put it to use with mini games from  power stone 2, and soul calibur.  now i won't have to go buy another vmu  if i want to save an nfl file, but keep a 50 noter."
5,Great headset. Bang for your buck.,Great for gaming
5,This is the ultimate Pokemon Ranger game around.,"Get rid of the other two, this is the only one you need. It's full of awesome gameplay, many many hours will be put into this one. The animations are awesome, really colorful and bright. It's just... fun. If you enjoy video games, Pokemon, or both... then buy this immediately. You will NOT be  disappointed."
4,Dont listen to the 2k SACKRIDERS,"Loved it dont believe all the haters. Sure the graphics are not like 2k but what people dont realize is 2k always has good graphics but the gameplay is trash. I own both 2k14 and Live 14 and they both have terrible flaws but Ea is going in the right direction with this game. To be specific the graphics are good, the synergy software and constant update is great I also like the detail ea spent on arenas ball handling and dribbling something 2k14 struggles with but the game needs more multiplayer online features and more options to create players and sliders and this game will get much better."
1,Same Ol,"Repetitive, redundant gameplay easily sums up The Division it's like Destiny's little brother. Bullet Sponge enemies with no depth. The game is just get cover shot, rinse and repeat until the enemies are gone."
4,"Great for exercise, but...","Like most, I bought a Quest 2 to make exercising at home fun. I play games like Beat Saber, Thrill of the Fight, and FitXR. As you probably know, the default mask has a foam lining, so sweat absorbs easily and takes forever to dry; hence the reason I picked this up. It's easy to clean and disinfect and fits perfectly over the default cover. Unfortunately, it fit too perfectly. The seal it creates is great for keeping some sweat out, but at the cost of terrible lense fogging. I can't go more than a couple of minutes without having to stop and wipe the lenses down. In the end it's a tradeoff: no sweat, but constant fogging or no fogging, but sweating foam padding."
5,just as pictured,great price much cheaper than the name brand. been in use now for months. no problems
1,broken,Product was broken out of the box. (Had DRM)
4,Pleasantly surprised so far and certainly not disappointed by The Golf Club!,"So Far Very Good game and FUN. Not as difficult to play as others have described. All you have to do is pay attention to what your doing and think about how much power while you swing, putt and decide what type of club to use and where you want the ball to land (I assume like real golf). I still enjoy Hot Shots Golf and EA Golf, but for the amount of detail for an independent developer game and attention to realism and ability to create your own courses makes this game well worth the price and time to play. I'm looking forward to playing a whole lot more and seeing what the developer comes up with next. I only took off one star due to the way the shading on background objects (trees) load while courses load and lack of live atmosphere (or maybe I haven't located one in the settings, we'll see). Developer home page seems to have a lot of detail on progress updates on this game and seem to be well aware of trying their best to make a very worthwhile experience from the couch without having to be on an actual golf course. Just remember to take your time and think before you swing and I think you'll have a satisfying experience like me. I'm pleasantly surprised so far and certainly not disappointed for my purchase."
5,Best Simpsons Game!,"I have tried the other Simpson's games ou there. This beats them all. While still based in the same driving theme as Road Rage, this game has way more improvements. You can actually get out of the car and explore Springfield on foot. Even the building interiors. Yes it is a lot like GTA, but I think it's way better because it has way more humor. Over ten thousand pieces of new dialogue was written especially for this game. In fact, the hardest part of the game is trying to finish the missions while chuckling over the jokes. And there are lots of neat features. Feeling a little destructive? Well go for it. Destroy property and run people over. You will eventually get nabbed by Chief Wiggums, but it only costs you a few coins in a very generous money environment. And there are parts of the game where your whole mission revolves around being a civil disobediant, so have fun. This Simpsons game way surpasses all the others."
5,Great,This thing is great. Doesn't take up much space and charges fast and easy. I added a headphone stand from Etsy.
5,Highly Recommended - Definitely Worth the Money,"Pokémon Rumble Blast builds upon the Pokémon Rumble game available on the Wii Shop channel, but knowledge of the previous game is not required to enjoy Rumble Blast.  The 3DS installment goes above and beyond the first game, adding towns, world levels, a developed story, and many more Pokémon.  The 3D graphics on the 3DS look clear and colorful.  For other 3DS games, I usually move my 3D bar on my system down to about halfway, but for Rumble Blast, I turn the 3D all the way up - the 3D is definitely one of the best I've seen on the 3DS.  The music in this game is also catchy;  a few of the tunes were taken from the original Rumble game.  Rumble Blast also supports a two-player mode, so you can play with your friends.  The length of the game also seems improved from the original.  At first the game starts out fairly easy, but it progressively gets more difficult and provides a challenge.  Even after playing through the entire game, it is still worthwhile to continue playing - there is a Collection option that acts like a PokéDex, where you can see all of the Pokémon you have encountered and which ones you haven't had join your team yet.  Overall, I am extremely pleased with this game, and it has met and exceeded my expectations."
4,Does not mute Microsoft Teams,"It said it worked with Skype and Office, and it does function, but the mute button should activate the software mute and vice versa - it does not.  I use MS Team all day.  The software mute shows I have a hot mic when I don't due to my hardware mute button being on... or in the other direction, my hardware line shows I can speak to others on the call, but in reality the soft mute is enabled.  Rather annoying. I was able to get the product returned via a very helpful customer service and they said they would make note that Teams does not work in their product description."
5,Nice package but don't pay more than MSRP,It's a well done version this year. The other reviewers are spot on. But I'm merely writing this to tell you not to spend more than 70 on this. It is available at several other retailers for the standard price. Do not feed the gougers here.
5,Just wait a little bit,The new 3ds is pretty amazing with 3 times faster speed nice firm buttons but buyer beware the system is region lock so you can't play American games on the system and the language is locked to Japanese but should be out in America and Europe in 1st quarter 2015
2,"Well, there goes another sports franchise","They completely ruined this game by not offering an option to change the controls.  This kills the fun of the game, I could understand if they made it so you had to use the RS to execute more advanced punches, combos, but to force you to use the RS for every punch was incredibly stupid, I hope whoever thought of that loses their job and is forced into a new line of work.  THE AUDACITY!!!"
4,"Great, but not perfect","Pharaoh is the next installment in the Sirrea City-Building series. It is set in Ancient Egypt, where you build cities for the Pharaoh. Pharaoh is a great game. It has nice graphics, similar to SimCity 3000 (no zooming  though. Set zoom level). The building toolbar is easy to use, and the game  is all around smooth. The bad part of the game is that it can be very  frustrating. In Pharoah, your food goes to your storage yards, and then to  the bazaars. The bazaar people then deliver food (a little backwards?) to  the surrounding nieghborhoods. Sometimes you can have 500 pieces of meat in  the bazaars, but the bazaar people don't sell it. They just sit there,  while people starve and move out of the city. Really though, there is no  major flaws. The number of buildings you can put in is vast, sometimes you  look at the screen, and can not find two buildings alike. The game will run  on a P166 okay, with the res. down to 640x480. I have tried the higher  resolutions, and everything is too small. This is a game that in many ways  in like SimCity, and is very well built. Bravo Sirrea!"
1,code doesn't work,it always say that when I tried to play the game
1,Scammelious Totalous!,"Total scam!, get it digital if you can find a copy, wait and there will be plenty!."
1,I do not recommend it,"I do not recommend buying this mouse, it takes time to load and download very fast, you practically have to have it connected to the charging cable all the time"
5,Best one out there,"We bought a Kinect a couple months ago and love it.  It works great, and we've had no problems figuring out how to use the system, even though my last console I had was a Sega Genesis.  The Kinect is space-age crazy, and it's amazing how well it works.  The Adventures game that comes with it is a great intro game into the ins and outs of how to use your Kinect.  Totally worth it and much better than any other competitor out there!"
4,Enjoyable HOG,"HOG with excellent graphics. Has two levels of difficulty. Not an especially difficult game at either level. Has the usual combination of mini games, hidden objects and puzzles."
5,Gaming on a budget!,Great value for a wireless mouse.  All buttons work correctly.  Weight feels good with batteries.  Mouse is accurate for gaming.  I bought this to replace my wired mouse from RD.  Now I don't have to deal with cord drag.
1,Not meant for a wii u.,"The screen is approximately 2 centimeters too short in height and 1 centimeter too short in length. Along with not fitting properly the thickness almost completely diminishes the responsiveness of the touch screen so both finger and stylus require near device breaking impact to register anything. Clearly NOT designed for a wii u, and is overall a bad buy what what they're marketing it as."
1,red color missing,The cable I received simply did not transfer the red color at all. I returned it and got refund without any problem.
5,Great quality game,The game plays great and is a lot of fun.  It has a very smooth combat system.
1,"if you're already decent, you won't need these","I guess I would consider myself a decent player, I would always be at the top of the leader board and keep a good KDR. So as many people I wanted to further improve my game and saw the many pleasant review about this product, so I decided to give them a go. Yeah, that was a big mistake. The height on the right thumb stick was way too high and it felt like learning how to play the game all over again.  My aim was way-way, very way off, and it didn't feel comfortable to raise my right thumb that high, but I had already spend my hard-earned money on this product, so I wasn't gonna give up so easily. And after a week of poor results I decided to take them off my controller, I threw them across the room and felt a relief to not force myself into liking those damn thumbsticks. And would you know it, my aim was even worst than with them on. I actually broke my controller and am out of action until I get paid. Yeah, do not buy this piece of crap product if you're already a good player, it will only alter your way of playing."
5,it is perfect you just have to be careful not to put ...,it is perfect you just have to be careful not to put in too many codes or it could cause the game to freeze or have items you are not supposed to have that could also cause your game to freeze
5,Amazing quality and nice features. Well worth the asking price.,"This headset is definitely good value for what you pay. I do appreciate the build quality and it does seem more premium compared to other similar headsets and even outclasses more expensive ones. So far I'm satisfied with this purchase, if you are looking for a solid headset that works well and will last you quite a while then check this one out and make the most of it. This has exceeded my expectations for sure."
1,"I Love the game, but it's completely broken.","I owned this great game for XBox and PS2, when I saw the great price on this, I grabbed it for nostalgia's sake - but when I attempted to play it, it wouldn't control properly at all... VERY disappointing - should be more warnings against it."
1,"So Much Potential, Wasted...","I loved the idea of this game, played it from the first weeks it launched, until about ayear later. Some people will tell you the New Game Experience or the Combat Upgrade killed Star Wars Galaxies. Truth is, they released the beginnings of a decent game, and never finished it. The NGE and CU just swapped out one unfinished system for another. I hope someday someone other than Sony remakes this game right."
5,Easy to set up and seems sturdy.,I never buy anything without reviews but all of the others had mixed reviews and this one was new and affordable so I thought I'd give it a try.  I had it set up in 5 minutes and tried it out and it held to my head firmly and comfortably.  The materials seem like good quality.  I'll update if it disappoints me.
1,NOT FOR XBOX,"Classic Microsoft, make something that only works on one of their platforms. This will be at the top of the list when you search XBOX GOLD, yet it is FOR PC. Infuriating does not begin to describe the level of frustration I have, this is one of the most disgusting things that I have ever seen the company do, and this is MICROSOFT we are talking about. DO NOT BUY"
5,The story is engaging and the graphics great to look at (specially the landscapes,"I am not a hradcore gamer, having bought an XBox One mainly as an entertainment box for cable and online TV when my PS3 died.  However, I decided to give Fallout 4 a try and was hooked immediately.  The story is engaging and the graphics great to look at (specially the landscapes.  The gameplay is fun and addictive, from finding artifacts and building settlements to creating relationships with companions. There is just so much to do...I could be playing this for years even after finishing the main story.  Despite all this my favorite part is the music, from the 50's themes to the classical score, it's all well chosen and appropriate to the game and game concept."
1,Mac Users Beware,"If you use a Mac computer to play this game, as I have for almost nine years with nary a serious problem, purchase this expansion at this time with eyes wide open. During the beta version a major bug involving video cards used by Macs, a bug for which the game developers were responsible (they have admitted this in the game's technical forums), was discovered. They did nothing about it, went ahead and launched the pre-expansion patches, and when patch 6.0.3 was activated, the ability of Mac users to play the game was severely impeded. This situation has not been fixed as of the date of this post. Three weeks now, and no word from Blizzard at all as to the current state of the problem and when a solution might be implemented. A small number of Mac users are able to play the game, so if you feel lucky, have at it and I wish you well. I shall shout slogans of encouragement at you while I log in...and crash...and log in...and not be able to move..."
1,Worthless,"I agree with the first review.  I found the Intec car charger to be completely unusable for the same reason - the charger would not stay put in the cigarette lighter slot in my Toyota 4-Runner.  The product is unusable.  I too purchased the Pelican PSP car charger afterwards, and it works great."
5,It gets the job done at an affordable price,I like it.  It's lightweight and stylish.  It charges in a decent amount of time.
5,Wii Controller,Product is the real deal. Exactly what I ordered and works well.
1,Only contain 5GB in the disc.,"I bought this because my internet is very slow and its only contain 5GB in the disc, now i have to download 19GB more. The game is great but the product is bad, Amazon should put this detail on the site."
5,Highly recommend. Works with 0 issues.,Have had no issues with this thing and I've used it dozens of times. Just waiting for a smaller charger for the switch dock. The OEM is too bulky.
1,Disappointed in the condition of the product,It was scratched up and not refurbished at all. It was also very dirty
1,DO NOT ORDER THIS VERSION ITS CENSORED!!!!!!,"Look at the order screen, this version is rated ""teen"" fallout is supposed to be rated ""adult"" THIS VERSION IS EDITED, ORDER THE OTHER, THIS EDITED VERSION IS MISSING QUESTS ETC WHICH MEANS ITS NOT THE FULL VERSIONS OF THE GAMES! BUY THE VERSION THAT IS RATED ADULT NOT TEEN."
1,One Star,Horrible It was the European version I ordered the u.s. Version the profile shows the American version
5,Not  Only A Sequel But An Excellent Game,Mario is back.  The worlds most reconizable computer character is back in yet another fantastic game.  Paper Mario is the second in the series (first being Super Mario RPG) of one the best fun games.  There is an introduction of two new characters (Gommbario and Kammy Koopa) which is introducing new life into the mario series.  The game will appeal to all as it starts off easy for everyone to grasp and then it gets progressive harder so those who have good gaming skill will still find it a challenge.  This game is worth buying as it is so fun and after all its MARIO
1,Not for a family game night.,This is not for family fun night. All it wants to do is get online and play random people.
1,Why Steam?,"I know this must be a wonderful game to play--I loved both Morrowind and Oblivion.  But having to use Steam to play makes this game a no-go for me.  Yes--I have a computer with all the requirements met.  Yes, Steam works, but...I live in a rural area with no cable and no satellite reception.  I've been downloading the game for 2 hours now and STILL have over an hour before it will be playable.  This is a huge disappointment.  When I ordered, it didn't say anything about Steam.  Why can't Bethesda release a version of this game with the content I PAID for on the dvd?  Not everyone lives where using Steam is an easy, fast option."
1,"Randomly picks a dpi, buckle up kids","Do you like it when half way through a game suddenly your mouse dramatically turns up or down the dpi its using?  Because if so this is the perfect mouse for you.  If on the other hand you want consistent performance get something different.  I know I did.  There is no reason for why it turns up to ultra high dpi or goes back down it just does it when it wants.  And I would rather get kicked in the head than try to deal with Amazons tech support again, seriously those guys could help you out of paper bag.  The short answer is dont buy."
5,Experienced players please apply!,"The trailer seen on You Tube does not give a proper realization of what to expect. This game has great graphics but intails a great deal of moving around in the game that is a bit disorienting so far in my early experience. One should be used to VR navigation before trying. Other than that, the game is going to be quite the adventure for sure!"
4,"Looks great, some bubbles","Looks great, some bubbles, but it's all me, I am terrible at installing these, along with those films for cellphones. Do not use the controller ones, they look awful and cheap. Buy a white controller or take it apart and paint it. Also mine did NOT come with logos."
5,Great Way to Improve you Wii Fit Workouts,"This step platform is great. I use it for a few different Wii Fit Plus workouts - mainly Advanced Step and Rhythm boxing, and it feels like I'm getting a more intense workout. I have not had any issues with it missing steps and the board fits snuggly onto the platform. I would recommend this to anyone that wants to add a little something extra to their workouts."
1,This game has software that can harm your computer.,"Starforce is a copy protection program that can harm your computer. It eats up CPU power, and causes slow downs. This cannot be removed. Stay away from this."
5,Not yet released,"To the best of my knowledge this character has yet to be released as part of wave 3 which is currently underway (Lightning Rod, Regular Stealth Elf(preorder), legendary Stealth Elf(available at Toys R Us now), Regular series 2 Erupter and Prism Break (pre-order).  Hot dog may likely come in a battle pack with another character (gamestop).  If you want to pay many times the normal amount for a character that hasn't been released who can stop you.  If this character is actually out it is news to me, and cannot be found at any of the major retailers I have researched.  Caveat Emptor.  Hope this helps."
5,CODES CAN BE FIXED,Call Nintendo they are fully aware that the codes don't work and will fix them while on the phone. Took me 10 minutes tops.
1,The kit did not include any way to charge the ...,"The kit did not include any way to charge the rechargable battery in the motion handle.  No cords I have fit them, we had to wait to order one, so needless to say my kids didn't get to play with it after christmas!  Very disappointing they don't throw in a 1.49 cord or SOMETHING to charge the controller that has to be charged some how!!!!!!!  You shouldn't sell something that won't work without buying a charger through another transacation, or at least tell us that in the description....."
5,Screw xbox one! It's all about the Wii U,This game is absolutely amazing! I can't get enough of it! it makes me smile and laugh constantly! being luigi and all his abilities and the co-op! You can tell all of detail went into this game! so much depth! so much!! all the controllers and re-play value! This is by far one of the best co-op party games Me and my friends have ever played! just the style and gameplay makes you want to immerse yourself in the game! whenever and where ever and you can!!!! I love this so much! A true HD Experience with super mario bros 2 in a co-op 3D-ish world! I would be any character because the games is that amazing! I don't care who I am as long as I get to play I'm the the happiest You could ever see
5,Solid controller,It was a bit of a pain getting  the controller to sinc up with my phone correctly. Overall I am very satisfied and glad I didn't go with one of the cheaper alternatives. I primarily use it with moonlight for streaming games from my pc. It also works well with games off of the gear vr.
1,Game isn't playable with bugs EA won't fix,"This game is or rather was a lot of fun; unfortunately I'm not able to play it anymore. As the game progresses Sims start to freeze, game lags and Sims even disappear. Check the forum on the Sims 3 website for all the many complaints about this problem and lack of support from EA sports. Don't waste your money because you will be disappointed in the end with all the time you put in for a game that crashes and you can't fix."
4,Mortal Kombat Unchained.......,"First, Dragonball Z Shin Budokai. Then, Tekken: Dark Resurrection. Now, Mortal Kombat:Unchained. With each new fighter released, I'm more and more convinced that the Playstation Portable can give a deep console presentation but on a portable and mobile device. Take Mortal Kombat: Unchained, for instance, -basically a port of Mortal Kombat Deception for the PSP that includes every last thing in the console game. Two fatalities per character with new death traps, stage fatalities-Completely redesigned single player Konquest mode-Features multi-tiered interactive backgrounds-With a mix of your favorite fighters as well as many new ones. It's the definitive portable Mortal Kombat experience every fan has waited for. I must say, I'm impressed. The loading times for the game are a smidgen long but doesn't mar things overall. Other than that, Mortal Kombat: Unchained is 'off the chain'. Seriously, you'll love it."
5,MUST HAVE,So comfortable
1,Double and Triple typing keys,"Unfortunately, this keyboard double and triple types letters and numbers. (It began after 4 months of use- I have changed the batteries a few times.) It has made typing and resetting passwords a nightmare. While playing games, it causes obvious problems when needing to play, such as casting, moving, etc. Also, having to press the enter button 10 times just to type, then typing gibberish when you need speed is annoying. Sometimes, keys are just unresponsive. It's obvious the issue is in broadcasting info, as the matching mouse has problems to at a distance of even 4 or 5 feet. Even typing this review requires gratuitous use of the backspace button. Totally sad, because the keyboard and mouse look and feel awesome. The only rating I can give is 1 star because there are no times of use where I do not have to use the backspace button, and I need to shop for an alternative."
1,amalaid,"I bought this game for my 6 year old daughter who will be entering 1st grade in September. The game says right on it ""For grades 1-4"", unfortunately, when you start the game the options are only for 2nd-5th grades. So, if you have a child in or going into 1st grade, this game is NOT for him or her. Very misleading."
5,An Amazing keyboard,"Love this keyboard!  I am not a gamer but my old keyboard is in a dimly lit area.  The lights on the keyboard help me locate keys easily-(not a typist either).  The lights are red, blue and violet and can be brightened or dimmed.  There are many functions on this keyboard that are truly amazing.  The FN key is like magic when it is combined with other keys.  I can access music by pressing FN in combination with the F1 key and increase and decrease volume by pressing the F2 or F3 key combo..  Really a remarkable keyboard. When I press  FN in combination with F12 I can even accesses a calculator. Product support was great also. Even has a two year replacement if the product is defective..  I love this keyboard."
2,Not for the 3DS XL!!!!!,"Although it is listed as being for the 3DS XL, this product is NOT.  Even the packaging only says it is for the 3DS, DSi, and DS Lite.  So, the listing is false advertising.  The only reason why I gave it 2 stars was because you can shove the 3DS XL into the accessory compartment... although barely."
1,Crappy product,First one I got was busted when I opened the box. So I against better judgment got a replacement keyboard and I received it today. Charged it and the keyboard doesn't light up at all. Will not buy again.
1,It's color is definitely dimmer than in the picture but ...,"It's color is definitely dimmer than in the picture but the main reason for the low rating is the low quality. In just putting it on, part of the adhesive was coming off."
5,Great,My son loves these for his old N64 and has no complaints other than the cord is a little shorter than the original.
5,works great!,"it is a very good workman chip item, it is so Quiet! and I like so much the illuminate Eagle head Logo it looks nice!"
5,Great bands so multiple users can enjoy the ring fit,"Works great.  apparently my daughter stopped playing because I sweat all over the original.  Now she has her own leg band, and straps to cover the ring and she is back at it, and enjoying it..."
2,Horrible!!,I bought Damnation on a hunch that it was going to be good because of all the hype I heard about the game. I guess thats exactly what codemasters wanted because this game is HORRIBLE! I tried and tried to give it a chance but it is such a weak effort. It had an interesting concept but the development was so bad. It plays like a PS1 game and the graphics are terrible. The voice acting almost made me cry of laughter it is so bad. Avoid this game at all costs.
5,What a blast...can't wait for Thanksgiving for a family Dance off!,I just Danced my booty off last night playing Just Dance Kids with my 10yr. old niece!  I purchased this dance game at her request for her birthday and little did I know what fun we all would be having - including the grandparents and my 4 yr. old son.  I'm gonna check out Just Dance for myself to work off some of my post-natal pounds - have fun and exercise with the kiddos at the same time - who would have thought!  Perfect timing for the winter weather too!
5,Works great,Just what I wanted. It charges my switch crazy fast and has a decent wire length without being to flimsy and breakable. The actual plug in part seems sturdy as well so far and doesnt bend or wiggle. Overall a quality product.
5,Get it. Get it now! The AAA game you need for PSVR.,"This is the first game I demoed for PSVR and also the first one I purchased. Totally worth the price, and the co-op mode is an awesome added bonus to its already obtained level of perfection. This game is fun, challenging and immersive. Graphics are great. No problems with tracking or motion sickness. The randomly generated campaign gives it endless re-playability. I've been playing all day and am now laying here in bed typing this review before I go to sleep and I'm wanting to go back to finish the next level of the campaign. Definitely the AAA game that PSVR needs. I'm not a huge gamer, maybe two hours a week if I'm lucky, but this game, and PSVR, are so awesome that my gaming habits will be changing! Haha."
1,Install never worked.,I will never waist my money in an EA game again.
1,Ridiculous Waste of Money,All this is is Vanilla Fallout 4 with fancy new art on the box and disc with a Code for the season pass. That's it. The DLC is not included on the disc. I've never been so pissed off. Thank you bethesda for wasting my money.
1,Device cannot read this card,"I can find no where in the advertisement for this item where it states that it is not compatible with a U.S. device.  I ""did my homework"" to make sure that this game would be compatible with the New Nintendo 2DS, which is clearly states that it is, only to receive a game that will not load on our DS device.  I am shipping it back for a refund."
5,Finally!!!!,"The end to the epic Saga has arrived. I've been a fan for years and waiting for this game to come out felt like an eternity. The game features incredible nice and clean graphics and the boss battles are still just as epic as ever. Plus as a bonus I received my order ahead of time and yes I did receive the preorder bonuses like the DLC packs regarding boruto and Sarad as well as Naruto and Sasuke The last with Sakura, Hinata, and Kakashi (Hokage Outfit) plus 2 free months of shonen jump which I did not know where included. Whether you've been a Naruto fan for years or are barley starting to dip your hands into the Naruto Universe this a perfect game for either type of player, fans will love the cut scenes and epic boss battles that retale the story like never before. Overall the game is a perfect conclusion to Naruto's tale."
5,"Durable, Perfectly Done","Wow!! Nintendo has perfected the gaming system controller. All of the buttons have perfect positions and are very easy to get used to. Microsoft didn't do very well ("" AHHH! THE CONTROLLER IS EATING ME ALIVE""). Sony really messed up. But Nintendo, a brand everyone trusts, makes it best. NOTE: DO NOT BY 3RD PARTY CONTROLLERS!! THEY ARE BAD!!!"
5,Great bag,"This is my second bag the first was the g-pak i got it somewhere else but the bag was way to small. The universal transporter is the perfect size. Only negitive thing i can say is my ds lite does have the nerf case on it and it wont fit in the little game pocket where it sould go but thats no problem at all i put it right in the front and use the pockets to store other items. The bag is made very well and will hold two games pure pocket not just one game and it has a zipper mess pocket to store yout headphones and cleaning cloth, has a place for your xtra stylus and two places to put the big stylus. I cant say enough good things about this bag. I have the blue one and the pink one is getting ready to ship. If ones not in stock at the time you can go ahead and order and they will ship when its in stock and doesnot take a long time to get. The pink one is very hard to find in stock. If you have a nerf case this will work just fine if you just use the front pocket and it sits right there longways or sideways and still zips up without any trouble! After all when you take the nerf case off you then can store two game systems but if your kids are small you will want to leave the nerf case on for awhile. Great bag and im super happy!!"
1,Never buying another razor again.,"This is the third razor mouse my husband has bought me for our gaming online.  I have to say I'm less then happy. It seems razor has no respect for female players and their smaller hands or the stess put on the palms fingers and forearms trying to hold on to these overly sized. Flared out shape, high tech looking peices of crap. I never realized that my husband was spending 80 bucks on a mouse for me till now. And what upsets me even more is that the difference in price is souly based on its color for this latest model he ordered for me.jist because its pink, doesnt mean its good for women and sure as hell doesnt justify a 30 dollar jump in price.  I will say there mouse is made with good quality material and durability is also good but if you are a woman looking for a gaming mouse I warn you that you will have a hard time finding a mouse if you have small hands like me. The butt of the mouse is too large cause my palm to have to grip around it. My fingers feel stressed spread out to the right on some models which are flared out. Even this model has a outward shape at the front which with the overall shape causes so much stress on my hand muscles that I get pain from my palm to my forearm. It makes my experience gaming frustratingly painful. Since I cant know how it will fit till it gets here I never know if what I buy is worth it and the thought of going through the return process and possibly charged a restocking fee makes me sick. I will never buy another razor ever again. Its overpriced garbage made to look fancy with lights but in the end worthless for this woken who wants a mouse that is made for a woman's small hands with tapered head not flared put painfulful torture machine."
5,Great,Liked family fun
5,"TeckNet Wireless Gaming Mouse with USB Nano Receiver, 2.4GHZ Up to 4800DP",I have been using this mouse for a few months and it has worked great so far.  The adjustable DPI has made it great for a variety of different gaming and for everyday use.  This mouse is a bit heavier due to the use of 2 AA batteries which I prefer over the rechargeable mice I have used in the past.  It also fits my hand comfortably with a nice arch giving me the feel I prefer for gaming. I do recommend this mouse and for the lower price compared to others with the same stats you can't go wrong.
1,How is there so many positive reviews?,"This is more of an moderately interactive movie than it is a video game. I played for about 3-4 hours in total and maybe had the controller in my hand for 30 minutes. I've already returned this ""game"". Decent graphics. Horrible controls. Lame monsters or zombies or whatever they're supposed to be. If you buy games to play then this isn't the ""game"" for you. If you buy games to watch like a movie and once in awhile move a character around then you'll love this ."
1,the worst to date,"Having played the NBA 2K franchise for years, I can honestly say this is, without a doubt, the worst to date. I was looking forward to the improvements from last years game, but instead it has unbelievable glitches that make the players both slow and glitchy-fast simultaneously. No assemblance of smooth game-play. Player can glitch past multiple defenders and suddenly end up at the rim. Forget trying to play hard-nosed defense. On-ball defense is next to impossible given the slight pause that ensues when you switch players on defense to guard the ball once it is passed. While the AI defense benefits the novice who just stays off ball and doesn't try to actually guard anyone, it makes it impossible for any on controlled on ball defense. Graphics are on par with last years game, with some actual decline in realism (Pippen looks like a squatty plump version of a player with 33 on his jersey; not even close to as accurate as last year.) Overall, I was extremely disappointed in this new addition to the NBA 2K family. Who knows. Maybe the glitches will endear themselves to me over time, but on first glance it's not a good feel."
4,perfect during halloween,"As  with other writers, I had difficulty when encountering the evil eye, which cannot be completed until the end of the game after you have obtained the last marble. After being frustrated, I consulted with other reviewers and learned you can continue through the game without completing the evil eye. I then went on to complete the game. Most puzzles are not terribly hard and some contain a solve option. I did not see this option on every puzzle though. I enjoyed it and will play it again after I have had time to forget some of the puzzles. As part of an older group of gamesters, this game was perfect for me."
1,Lose lose...,"What can i say, although i see the appeal for a certain audience contained within this cartridge.  When I played my friends copy I was quite underwhelmed, but because i own so many games was still going to buy it.  (i understand this makes me a moron).  But i refuse to because of Capcom's choice to sell a broken game, give no reason as to why the data cannot be re-written, and try to get away with it.  I promise unless this feature is fixed, I will never buy this game.  An otherwise would be sale."
5,Best choice,"I love it, it's clean, easy set up and just exactly what I wanted. Thought chat headset came with but I'll be ok for now."
1,For games like pubg where you need to hear footsteps and all ...,"The surround sound does not work. For games like pubg where you need to hear footsteps and all that, you can't use this headphone."
4,Not very loud,Love this headset but it doesn't get as loud as some of my others. I have to turn it all the way up when I game. The noise cancelation is great and the mic turns on and off when you raise or lower it. It is annoying that the dongle automatically sets the volume on my Ps4 to the headset before I even turn it on. I have to either go into settings and change that or unplug the dongle if I'm wanting to game without the headset.
5,Five Stars,Excellent headset!
5,Nice,This was a Christmas present for my son. He was excited to get a new controller and it is perfect for him.
5,Thumbs up,While it unfortunately turned out to not be the solution to my problem it worked fine and shipped fast.
2,no recibi el producto,"en la orden de entrega dice que fue entragado porq en la recepcion me dicen q no hay nada, como puedo reclamar. gracias."
1,Beta Release?,"I have played every title in this series. Loved them all. I bought the Special Forces Version, loaded it without a hitch, and started to play. I was 30 seconds into the game when I realized the video frame rate was choppy. I have an SLI rig, but they are Nvidia 8500 GTs, so we aren't talking top of the heap. Still, its an SLI. Nope, all settings to lowest, still choppy frame rate. Windowed screen 800x600 (or whatever the smallest was) text requires magnifying glass, and the frame rate is still choppy. I am hoping that there is a patch to fix the issues, but until then the game is unplayable."
1,Save your money - don't buy it,"Complete waste of money.  Don't buy it.  It's a 6 year plus software that they are still trying to make money out of it.  Terrible garphics, it works only out of the CD, poor user interface.  There are much better programs on the market."
1,Code is invalid,I bought second one for my friend and the code id invalid. What do i do now? Did i waste my money? Is it like gambling??
1,Avoid PC version of this game!,"This game had a lot of potential, and was enjoyable for the first 1-2 hours. After that, wow so terrible. The main issue with this game is aimbot hackers. Soon as you spawn, you die from someone across the map. The game experience is just so terrible because of this. Read EA forums, and you will see it is not an isolated incident. There are many groups of people returning this game due to this issue. If you want to play it, get it for XBOX or PS4 because I don't think there are the same issues there."
1,Impossible to get bubbles out. Buy something else-- I'll sure have to.,"I can't express my frustration with this product vehemently enough. I've bought and applied glass protectors like this to every phone and other portable electronic device I've had for years, and it's almost always a quick and easy process. This was not. I went through both of the included glass protectors trying to get a bubble-free install, and in each case was unsuccessful. Despite assiduously cleaning the screen each time, after each initial application there were tiny bubbles everywhere that were impossible to completely eliminate with the included scraping tool. I tried gently lifting the edge closest to the bubbles to herd them that way, which seemed to work, except now the corner I lifted has a perpetual bubble. All in all a terrible experience. I'm removing this protector immediately and taking my chances until I can get a new one. Worst glass screen protector I've ever run across, for any device."
5,Works as well as you could hope!,"Not much to say here, it's pretty much a carbon copy of the OEM adapter and works exactly the same. I've used it for charging while playing, charging while playing on a mini USB-C dock, and just charging alone and it works flawlessly in all cases."
5,Great game,Game is amazing didn't have to download any add on's Game came with all add on's already in game awesome graphics and great sounds it's amazing every time a zombie chased me i felt all the hairs stand up on my body crazy scary feeling when playing this game 4 stars all the way
5,PS4! Best gaming system around.,I see some people are having issues. Not sure what that is about. Mine works like a champ! I love it! I highly recommend anyone who loves games to get this.
4,Sonic is back on the DS,"Picking up where Sonic Rush left off, Sonic Rush Adventure is another blast of the 2-D based, super speed action that reminds us why the Sonic the Hedgehog series was so great in the first place way back when.  Along with the traditional side scrolling levels, there have been more 3-D elements added this time around, while the overall look of the game is an intriguing fusion of 2-D sprites and 3-D models.  The overall level designs and minor control issues from the first game have been improved upon here, and the Wi-Fi capability, extra mini-games, and side missions make this package all the sweeter.  The only real downsides of Sonic Rush Adventure is that like every Sonic game to come out of Sega in the past few years, the characters are quite annoying.  The story elements of the game are lame as can be, and will make you long for the simpler times of Sonic's early days when he let his spin dash do the talking.  That aside, Sonic Rush Adventure is a pure blast to be had, and for Sonic fans new and old alike, this game is definitely worth checking out or picking up for your DS."
5,GREAT case,"This case is great whether or not you have a 3ds. It comes with 40 individual spots to hold your games which sold me. No more digging in my case for the right game, or worrying about them falling out. This case solved all my problems. The inside can hold 2 DS systems or a DS and charger. It also has individual slots for styluses and a deep bottom to fit AR cards or anything else one might want (screen protectors, ect). The front has a convenient zipper for chargers to keep them out of the way. It is also very comfortable to hold, and the strap is a good length. I am very happy with this case."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!!,"EVERYTHING is broken and NOTHING is fixed yet. The cities still don't sync with the servers correctly (I'd complain about the DRM, but enough people have done that already), the traffic AI is a MESS, sharing resources with other cities is completely full of bugs. These kind of problems are what one would expect in an unfinished alpha or beta version, NOT a finished product. It is downright insulting to think that EA actually thinks they can get away with selling this garbage. I will NEVER buy another EA product EVER again."
5,Iron Man 2 disc Gift set Best buy,Iron Man so powerfull. i don't give you a big review for this. but i loved Iron Man specially Iron Man Mini Bust. I have mask edition and I am so glad have this edition too. why blu-ray don't have a nice edition like dvd.
4,Hard to get on but not impossible,"The case is hard to get on, the top of the case got a little stretched out around the vent for the cooling fan while putting it on but it's really no big deal. The Switch docks just fine so I'm assuming the people who have issues docking stretched out the bottom of the case when putting it on. The joycon cases fit perfectly, not too hard to apply them. The screen protector was easy to put on but I wouldn't use the ""alcohol wipe"" that comes with the case because the screen stayed wet. Instead use a lens or eye glass wipe if you have one. If you have previous scratches, cracks or dings in your screen the protector will bubble over the areas and at that point the bubbles are your fault. If your screen is clean and clear the protector goes on no issues. Not sure how well the case will protect the whole device because it's not like a hard case but hopefully it does its job."
4,Ridge Racer 3D or Asphalt 3D? Can't Go Wrong Either Way!,"I bought Asphalt 3D first and I am happy with it. Then I bought Ridge Racer 3D and I am happy with that as well. I think they're both excellent racing games and you really can't go wrong with either one. Ridge Racer's graphics are a little more fluid and the cars handle a bit more realistically than the ones in Asphalt 3D in my opinion. The thing I like about Asphalt 3D over Ridge Racer is that you can do take downs and there is oncoming traffic unlike in RR where everyone is going the same direction. Also, Asphalt 3D has a pursuit mode where you run from the law which is always fun. BUT the thing I like about Ridge Racer over Asphalt 3D is the slipstreaming, the drifting, and the graphics are a tad less choppy looking. (Don't let that scare you. The choppiness is very minimal anyway.) The car handling in Ridge Racer to me seems a little more realistic than it does in Asphalt 3D. So, bottom line: If you want a great straight forward Racing game, get Ridge Racer 3D. If it's vengeance and aggression you want in a racing game, get Asphalt 3D. Graphically, the image in Ridge Racer seems a little less grainy-looking than in Asphalt 3D to me. As another reviewer mentioned, the opening animation in Ridge Racer is very cool...a little flirty.  :)  If I had to choose one of these over the other....h-m-m.....I think Ridge Racer would win. I like that there are more tracks available in the beginning."
4,Tight Fit,"Case is tight when attempting to store Oculus, charger, controller and eyeglass accessory."
1,Not worth early adoption,Out of the box it doesn't read game discs and the Kinect isn't detected as being plugged in. Save your money. Wait until MS get their bugs figured out.
5,big hit,"I'm a busy father: small infant daughter, full time tech job, loving wife, etc. When I finally find time to sit down with the xbox, the last thing I want to do is get involved in a year-long role-playing game, online clans, or anything like that. My xbox time is spent on one thing only: blowing stuff up. Mercenaries is perfect for this. I can drive and blow stuff up, fly and blow stuff up, or run and blow stuff up. The game is deep enough to keep my interest over time and visually interesting enough to make me want to play. There's nothing like peeking over a ridge and letting an RPG fly into a DPRK tank. Bring 'em on."
5,Great price,The price for this remote was great. They work great and easy to store away. Light way remote makes it easy to play with.
5,Awesomeness in your hands !,"Short and simple review. For people who enjoyed Persona 3 and persona 4 you will enjoy this ! Persona golden is a RPG game and a remastered version of persona 4 which was release for the ps2 a few years back. Persona golden features many new things which wasn't avaliable in the ps2 version such as an extra character , personas and social links. The persona games takes a crap load of time to complete and has alot of replay value even after finishing it. Overall for people who enjoyed the persona games it is HIGHLY recommended that you pick up this copy ASAP !! and for those who are new to the game or the RPG genre give it a go and I know you wont regret it as there is soooo much to do in this amazing game."
5,Best Wired Controller,Power A are the best and most durable wired controllers on the market for the price! Love the extra long cord too!!
5,I Love It!!!,"Own this and the Vive. Like the video quality, text is easy to read. Things like this makes me excited about technology and hungry for more. Absolutely amazing. It is so much fun. I am looking forward to more games for it."
5,3rd party HHD don't expect it to play first Gen. xbox games.,"320GB(293GB free space, 27Gb for system requirements) HHD for xbox 360 slim. Easy to install, i downloaded 30GB of Games, dlc to the HHD in 4 hours 35 mins. For the price this is a great product, I highly recommended."
1,Came Broken,I opened the package and the cord that connected to the Xbox one controller was in 2. A waste of time. Never trusting refurbished products again.
5,Works and looks great! Only wish they had a rubber bottom to ...,Works and looks great! Only wish they had a rubber bottom to keep the controller and stand from sliding so easily on glass. The elite controller you will have to remove the paddles on the back for it to fit correctly.
5,Great Value,Works great for the money you spend and is universal among DS versions. It also comes in a two pack which is awesome! Will continue to buy.
1,price gouger,gouging
5,All in working order,Everything worked: happy with purchase
1,"Analog sticks have ""joycons drift""","I thought this would be the perfect controller for me. I've been wanting it for sometime and I finally saved up for it. It came like 4 days later and there it was! It was finally here. I plugged in some AA batteries and j connected it to my switch and lone-behold!!! Right off the bat, it has joycons drift for lack of better terms. When I move the left stick to navigate the home menu, it would either go one back, or many back, and in game the c stick when tilting to the right registered as a down movement. How do I know all of this??? I took it one step further to prove my point. I went to the settings to try to calibrate the sticks ( like the joycons) only to see that they weren't compatible with the calibration settings, but you can still analyze the stick movements and there it was. Everytime I clicked right, it would register as down. And for the left analog stick, it would go up or left. Such a cool product but the internal issues are poor. Now it could have been a defective product, and I'm rightfully so to return it, but out of everyone one I know who has one, why'd it have to be me?? And that's why it gets a 1 star."
5,A Grand Hack-n-Slash Adventure,"I love this game for what it does well.  It is a wonderful single-player hack-n-slash adventure set in a creative and vibrant world with mythical overtones.  However, I must caution you.  This is not Diablo III.  This game is not really meant to be a multiplayer game.  It is a single-player game with the multiplayer option.  It handles multiplayer much like Sacred did by matchmaking you with those who host a server.  There is no central Battle.net service here, and the multiplayer suffers because of it.  Plus, this is a very linear game.  Also, the game doesn't offer anything new to the genre that hasn't been done previously.  But, it does borrow some of the best elements of gold standards in the industry like Diablo II, Sacred, and Dungeon Siege.  The true strength of the game is the skill and character sets.  There are so many ways you can develop a character and, in turn, so many ways you can choose to approach the gameplay.  Helping our character grow and choosing the path is a lot of fun.  I presently have 4 different characters I'm playing - each with a unique style of play that makes the gaming experience different.  The graphics and sound are wonderful and what you would expect from contemporary games.  In conclusion, if you are looking for a multiplayer experience like you had with Diablo II, this is not the game for you.  If you want a fun and beautiful single-player game along the lines of Sacred and Dungeon Siege, Titan Quest is well worth the money.  I've been unhappy with many of the games I've bought so far this year - I'm not unhappy with this one.  Jump in and have a blast!"
1,low quality and crazy input lag,"i originally gave this 2 stars because of the poor quality alone but after attempting to play Super Smash Brothers Ultimate with it, I had to change my rating to 1 star. the Input lag on this this is crazy. Almost any video game requires you to make quick precise movements and decisions and you will never be able to win a game of smash bros with this thing. take your money elsewhere."
5,An absolute sparkling testament...,"To the power of plagiarism, theft, and all around shenanigans. It takes some serious skill to be able to manage so many game assets from so many disparate sources! I mean, the database alone needed to organize all of that stolen work must have taken more time than the development of the game engine itself! Of course, they didn't write the game engine either, but let's not quibble over details, right? Seriously folks, the audacity and brazen lack of scruples shown here is an event for the ages. A veritable motive power for the modern Zeitgeist of western culture. Books shall be written, methinks. Perhaps even film? Uwe Boll could direct in his stunning fashion a film worthy of this fiasco, nae epizootical farce of a game! The number of stars reflects the amount of entertainment I have received from the veritable cornucopia of glee I take from watching these fools squirm. Huzzah!"
5,"An enchanting, fun game for girls","I bought this game for my daughters for Christmas in 2003 and they still play with it at least once a week now (dec. 2004).  There are matching games, problem solving excercises and they have to find hidden objects.  They love the music, the games - all of it.  This is a great gift for any girl from age 3 - 8!"
5,PORTABLE PERFECTION,"This game is one of the best reasons to own a PSP. Period.  The graphics are the best I've seen and the gameplay matches it perfectly.  The load times-an issue with alot of PSP games-are minimal.  The game is very polished and has a ton of features.  This and Street Fighter Alpha 3 are the very best fighting games you will find on the PSP or any portable system for that matter.  Just accept the game for what it is- a version of Tekken that looks and plays the absolute best it can under the limitations of a portable system.  Thank you very, very much, Namco."
5,So far so good.,Very nice console. Initial setup was easy. The only problem I had was the initial update timed out a few times. After update and log on the console works great. I tried the blu ray and Madden and both look outstanding. The new controller is a great design.
1,junk,i left a review on 05-15-21 that the batteries are the only good part of this thing. i kid you not 1 hour later they to self-destructed. this item has NO redeeming features. stay far far away
4,Four Stars,Great past time game. It has some replayability
1,Cheap knock off,"Not a Microsoft product, cheap and broke withing 2 days."
5,Good Buy!,"Works great according to my 7 year old, I am still confused at what this is but he says it works great and he loves it!"
2,Jeopardy 2003 A Rip-Off,"Jeopardy 2003 is a huge WASTE OF MONEY!  First of all, the program is flawed because it periodically shuts down.  And it will do so in the middle of a game, so be forewarned.  Second, all of the questions are exactly the same as the Jeopardy 1st edition game!  I thought I was buying a whole new, fun Jeopardy game (because after much play on the 1st edition, my family and I had memorized most of the answers).  Instead, I got essentially the same thing as I already owned, only the computerized Alex doesn't have a mustache this time.  Furthermore, the ""Tournament of Champions""...totally bogus.  It is mostly questions from the regular Jeopardy rounds mixed up to make you think they are the more difficult T.O.C. questions.  Overall, this game gets a big fat ZERO with me.  The price I paid was NOT well worth it for what I received.  Alex and Merv should have thought twice before putting their names on this game..."
5,Better late than never!,"Got a code for the Gjallarwing Sparrow (and horn noise) the day after Rise of Iron launched. I wish the advertising for pre-order bonuses would have been clearer; I assumed every pre-order was the same. Glad Amazon came through. As for RoI itself, has been extremely fun so far!"
1,Not happy at all!,If you are thinking about buying this game but do not currently pay for Xbox live membership DON'T waste your time. You can't just play the game like a normal video game you have to pay for the additional service or the game is useless. I bought the game because my son and I enjoyed the first version. So I got this one because the graphics looked cool and like it would be fun to play with my 9 year old. I opened it (so now can't return it) figuring like any other game you just pop it in the player and off you go if you want the other features then you could sign up and pay the extra fee. Boy was I wrong and I am not a fan of wasting money. Very disappointed in this game. It should not be an online only if its meant for the Xbox360.
1,Horrible!,This game would be great if it worked correctly. Myself and many others are constantly having issues with game randomly stopping. I highly suggest not purchasing this game.
5,Five Stars,Excellent sound. My whole family uses them.
5,Modern looking and feels good,"This controller looks almost futuristic and it looks just as good in person as it does in the pictures. The rubber grip feels good too. I can't comment on its durability as I've only had it for a few days but I would imagine it would be comparable to other xbox controllers. I don't have an xbox, I use the controller to play FIFA, fighting, and racing games on PC."
1,"Disctray doesn't work, Wont play my games.","Just got home from picking up my xbox one from BestBuy and the stupid disc tray makes this weird noise. Even worse, it wont play the games. An error pops up telling me to try again."
4,It's frustrating,"I have never played this game before. Initially a bit overwhelmed with the amount of information and how all the statistics influence the outcomes, but once that was understood, the frustration sinks in as there is absolutely no way to continue the game from where you die. You go back to the beginning of the chapter, always. It becomes boring because it's never easy to beat the chapter boss, you'll die dozens of times, and going back to the very beginning after so much work is very annoying and frustrating. Definetly not a game that keeps you interested in continuing if all that happens is dying and going back to the very beginning. Graphics are great, implementation of commands are just okay, if it could save the progress near the area where you die, this would be a 5 star game. Going back to the beginning every single time is a big turn off for me, even with the eventual shotcuts that appear."
2,Wanted to Love This Controller,"I really wanted to like this controller. I love, love, love the layout and feel of it. I love that it has mouse mode, one of the main reasons I decided to buy it. It looks great which is the only reason I am giving it two stars. Because it has one fatal flaw. It ghost touches buttons. There are times where I'm playing a game and the trigger buttons are active even when I'm nowhere near them. Sometimes shaking the controller helps and stops the issue, but most times it doesn't. I thought maybe it was just a rare defect so I got a replacement controller which seemed to work great for the first two hours... until it started having the same issue. I bought my brother this controller from Best Buy two months or so before I ordered it and his is now starting to have the same issue as well, but worse. While the two controllers I had from amazon only really had trigger buttons issues, his A, B, triggers, and more are malfunctioning. So it's definitely a controller issue. We both take great care of our equipment. I'm very disappointed because this controller had so much potential. Will be returning mine to Amazon (for the second time) and my brother's to Best Buy. Probably will purchase the ever reliable Xbox controllers."
1,EA and DRM not worth it,"EA can make some great titles, but the DRM software that is part of the install isn't worth it.  I am not sure what EA was thinking, but what ever employee thought this was a good idea should be fired."
5,Spidey's Antics,"If you ever wanted to feel like what it was like in Spiderman's shoes, Spiderman 2 by Activevision is one of the closest experiences you'll ever have. Following the plot of the movie fairly closely, with a couple of irritating detours, you get to swing from the buildings in a virtual New York that's expansive and fun. The thing that impressed me the most was having total control of Spiderman, and if a challenge proved to be too pesky, I could restart that chapter from the beginning and swing around town until I went back to the challenge. If I earned points for everytime I went to the top of the Empire State Building and swan dived off from it, I'd have won the game earlier. Kudos to the Activevision people for making a truly enjoyable romp!"
4,"Good screen protector, however not for Matte Deck","These screen protectors are great, but if you have matte version of Steam Deck, they will defeat the purpose of antiglare coating it has. (Ended up removing it and I don't think there is an alternative)"
5,Its good!,"As far as the game itself,  it's great. The graphics are a little downgraded as expected,  but the gameplay is , to me, same as it is on xbox one. ( I also own xbox one x).  Handheld mode plays great also and looks good considering it's on a 720p small little screen. I mostly play my switch docked, but I bought mk11 on switch for the portable aspect of it and I just love Nintendo. But I do also own xbox version. So all that being said, the switch version besides graphics , is just as fun or good as the other versions. And the graphics aren't tht much downgraded considering how underpowered the switch is. My ONLY complaint is that even tho I bought the physical copy,  u still have to download 16.1gb of data to have access to whole game. All u can do b4 download is fight local multiplayer or computer. Not story or towers. Jst normal fight. Everything else is locked until 16.1gb download is done. Tht is bullcrap. I mean the whole digital edition isnt but like 22gb....so tht means they bought the smallest card possible and make u download most of it anyway. Defeats the purpose. I'm very against the all digital stuff. I like physical stuff tht I can hold and trade or sell if I like. Other than that its awesome."
5,When Tony Hawks Collide,"This game is definatelty looking to be greatness. All the level from Tony Hawk 1 and 2 with very revampes graphics.  It also has 5 new levels. Its a shame the some will not buy this because Tony Kawk 3 is coming out close to the same date as it.  This is assured to be one of the best games at launch, if it manages to stay a launch game that is. The graphics are very good, i havnt seen enough pictures to say amazing though. If you like other Tony Hawks than youll love this. Only people that do not like skateboarding games will not like this.  I also hear that the grass flows in real time, which most people like me wont care about, but some people might.  I am very eager to play this and see if it meets my expectations which im sure it will.  I dont know if this is going to be better than Tony Hawk 3 or not, but i know that it has better graphics at least, plus its made by the same people, so they'll make the games equal and not be competing."
2,Discoloration after short period of use.,"I loved the look of the case when I first got it in May 2020, but it wasn't long before it started getting dark spots where it's held. No, it's not dirty. The plastic changed colors. Off to find a better option."
1,Do NOT BUY.  NOT A COMPLETE SYSTEM,"Misleading product.  Missing key parts.  Opened it just now as it was given as a Christmas present.  It is too late to return or ask for help.  Missing the Sensor Bar and the plug to the TV.  Not a complete system, should not be allowed to sell a partial system.  I have some very disappointed kids now."
4,ITS PLAYSTATION! WITH SOME MINOR CUT BACKS,"I was very pleased when I heard this was coming out in Canada and America I immediately went out and bought one. Well what can I say its the same as playstation only much much smaller. The old memory cards and controllers are compatible with the PSone if you were wondering.  I love this console and it is great, but i see a few problems. There are no large ports on the back for products like Gameshark, or other MOD chip type devices, the could be a problem if you want to play imported or backup copies of games. uless you get the interior mod chip.  Overall its great, I just wish they could have somehow included the extra ports on the back!"
1,Train Wreck,"Black Ops 2 at least attempted to do a few things different. However, this current incarnation of Infinity Ward is so incompetent that what we have is something not very far removed from MW3. It's dull. The map design is horrendous. Ugly. The graphics on the PS3 version (and 360 version) are a step back due to a sacrifice to the 60 frames per second gods. Despite all the money this franchise has made which could go to dedicated servers, the lag makes most matches unenjoyable. There is nothing new here. People are always hyperbolic with that phrase but there is LITERALLY nothing new here. This is the epitome of playing it safe."
1,Dont bother,The bat has a kind of periscope to make it work correctly. I was unable to even start a game without even taking the Wiimote out to select. It became very frustrating to use everytime you have to make a selection you have to remove the Wiimote. Dont bother.
2,What a Let Down,"Harry Potter Years 1-4 is my favorite Lego game. I really enjoyed playing the entire game using the stylus. That being said, why they didn't stay with a good thing for this 2nd Harry Potter, I can't figure it out. This Harry Potter Years 5-7 has poor graphics and what little touch screen that is used is kinda confusing. I'm somewhat disappointed and don't even feel like finishing the game. It's probably an okay game, lack-luster compared to the first Harry Potter."
5,Great mouse,Comfortable to use and it looks great! The customization features are wonderful and easy to set up.
5,Spectacular,"I was never too fond of RPG's when I was younger, no matter how much I loved video games.  Final Fantasy VII changed that, along with how I looked at the genre, as I, like many others, became addicted to the game's emotional storyline and well-rounded characters.  Since then, we have seen a number of tie-ins, spin-offs, and even feature films based on the Final Fantasy VII universe, and now, Crisis Core has finally arrived.  Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII is a prequel to the game, where you play as Cloud's old friend and partner Zack, and uncover secrets and revelations that are full of surprises, and lead up to the events of Final Fantasy VII.  First off, the game is is simply gorgeous to look at.  Not just the cut-scenes, which themselves are beautiful and stunning, but even the in-game graphics look great, making this undoubtedly the best looking RPG to hit the PSP, and the game's voice acting is even better.  The game's combat system is also worth mentioning because it isn't quite turn based, and isn't quite real time.  Instead, it is a fast moving system that is quite fun in itself, even if it may come off as a bit too easy for some.  Leveling up and performing Limit Breaks is now determined by the slot machine-esque DMW system, which is a fun little twist as well.  There are familiar characters abound as well: Cloud, Aerith, Tifa, and of course, Sephiroth.  The game's story wonderfully weaves into FFVII mythology, and offers some new perspectives on Zack and Sephiroth, and those respects alone, Crisis Core is worth picking up.  All in all, Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII is a stunning achievement that is an absolute essential addition to your PSP library, and needless to say, if you love everything Final Fantasy VII and you own a PSP, you have to pick up Crisis Core."
5,Fun all ages game,"Great game! Community Experience is unparalleled, visuals are gorgeous, fun game for any age range"
5,Must Buy 4 ACE Combat 7 Players,Worth Every Penny. Seller Shipped it Lighting Fast. Got it from UK within 4 Days. Love My Joy Stick
5,This game is UNBELIEVABLE!!!,"This is the greatest game Ive ever played bar none.  When I was in highschool I loved Civilization 2.  I recently got a computer and wanted a good game.  I bought Civilization 3 and it seemed to have lost something.  I cant put my finger on it but it just didnt have the soul.  Or maybe I have changed and need more exitement.  Well anyway I took a chance on Stronghold Crusader and havent stopped playing since.  This game is simply amazing.  You build up a castle(kind of like sim city).  You have to build houses for the people and cathedrals.  The graphics are simply beautiful.  The battles are very INTENSE.  And strategy changes on each skirmish.  What worked in one, dosent get you anywhere in another.  This game has the soul I was talking about earlier.  I really feel angered when my castle is getting burned down.  I take it personal.  How many games emmerse you to the extent that you get so involved in the game.  I havent ever taken a game so much to heart.  Take a chace on this one.  Its not very expensive and has kept me at it for many days.  Very addictive.  And the thrill of beating a lord who has been given you a hard time.  That thrill of victory is priceless.  Go out and buy this game.  NOW!"
1,nothing worse than playing a game and getting deep into the ...,Bought 2 and have problems with both staying synced... constantly losing connection... nothing worse than playing a game and getting deep into the game and u get killed because u lose connection and have to start the game over!!!!
5,"Great headphones, make sure you buy it from a reputable seller!","I love these headphones, I use them primarily on my xbox one.  My friends have never had a problem hearing me.  I like the mute function too when I need to speak to someone in the room without the folks online hearing me. As other folks have noted they could be a tad louder but they are still great!  I highly recommend you get them from a decent high reviewed seller (I used iDor).  I had to replace mine and it made a world of difference."
5,Quick and Easy,"Works GREAT.  Drop the controller on the charger and walk away.  Uses a standard USB micro-B cable, so i used a long phone charger to reach to the outlet.  Controllers fit perfect and the batteries last all day.  I did not have issues installing the battery packs like other reviews claim."
1,Stealing money,Do not buy. Ripoff. So much cheaper if you buy console and game separate.
1,DO NOT RECOMMEND INSTANT ACCESS!!,"WOULD NOT recommend instant access, says it processed successfully to Origin, DID NOT SEE IT THERE WHAT SO EVER!!! demanding a refund!"
4,"Perfect, Beautiful, Suspensful, But Flawed","Teetered between a four and a five on this game, submitting a 4 for one particular reason I feel really subtracted from the game. Subnautica is an open world survival game with elements of crafting and exploration as the core focus on gameplay. Fighting is possible but not encouraged for reasons I will get into. The exploration element in games is something that is usually something relaxing, finding new areas, seeing new sights, and encountering new curiosities. NOT IN THIS GAME. Due to the setting, you are alone. In the open ocean. On an alien planet. It cannot be understated that this game is a scary game. Instead of readily moving to new areas, you'll find yourself nervous to creep from the safe shallows you start the game in and only find that nervousness grow as you explore deeper and further from your starting location. You'll learn to dread the night, as visibility drops to near zero and the ambiance of ocean life and predators occur all around you, making you look in circles at every sound waiting to get attacked. Half the time it will be a friendly reefback, the other half, you'll turn to see a leviathan about to take a chunk out of your fresh new submarine. The environment is beautiful and each biome is unique and vastly different in appearance. The world is not randomized, it will be the same every time, but that is a good thing, as you'll quickly learn routs to get from area to area as safely as possible. And it would be awful to start the game just above the dunes where leviathans are everywhere before you can get your first piece of titanium. The story and lore is interesting to say the least, and can be ignored or be dove into in equal levels. The only reason I give this game a 4 instead of a 5 is how it runs on xbox. Far, far too often am I going along only to notice nothing has spawned around me and I'm in a void, only for the world to pop in around me and I'll either be slamming into a wall or there will be a leviathan in front of me I had no hope of seeing since it hadn't spawned. The draw distance is not good enough, and I shouldnt have to sit and wait 30 seconds for the next rule of environment to load in while I'm trying to go in a direction, as I have no idea what lies ahead. Overall, excellent game, but it needs better loading."
4,LED's glitch out at random,"I got this replaced by Amazon prior to this one, same keyboard, but it seems to have the same issue as the last one.  A random LED or 2 that light up the keys just randomly turns off, or never turns on at all.  Very annoying!"
5,Absolutely love this keyboard! :D,"I just received the keyboard I ordered from you guys and I've gotta say I already love it. The sounds from each click, the different settings for the colors of the keyboard and the overall feel of the keyboard just make it so amazing. I love it! Along with emailing for the gift you offered in the box the keyboard came with I also had to email and say thank you for making such an amazing product. If it's not too much trouble, I think the mouse would pair well with the keyboard so that is the gift I choose. Thank you so much and again I really appreciate the work you put in, I'm super stoked about it."
4,Almost like BookWorm,"This game is a lot like Bookworm that you can play on your PC, but not quite as challenging as the letter area is not as big, and there are no ""burning"" letters. It could be a bit more challenging, with more letter space like on the PC version, but it's a lot of fun."
5,Works great!! Highly Recommend,"My 7 year old son has recently gotten into video games and was running through AA batteries like crazy. I thought about using regular rechargeable AA batteries, but came across this battery pack and charger combo. It's great. It charges via a USB cable, but with no spare plugs around, we were able to plug it straight into the Xbox for power. My son can play his games and easily put it back on the charger, until it's ready to use next time. The charger packs were black and our remotes are white, but you don't even notice, as you're playing games. I highly recommend."
1,Waste of money in it's current state,Played this for 30 minutes and stopped. There are way too many bugs that shouldn't be an issue on release day. The developers should have fixed this stuff before the game came out. Waste of money in it's current state.
1,I Am so incredibly disappointed in this game,"I Am so incredibly disappointed in this game.  You might like it if you have never played the sims before, or it all you have played is the Sims Freeplay app.  If you loved Sims 2 or 3 you will be bored in about an hour.  Feels like EA took this franchise back to Sims 1."
5,Controller,Working good
2,"Unfinished, insulting product!!",The corporate pals at Gamefreak should be ashamed and I feel bad for the developers who had to rush this game out and create this!
1,LOOKS LIKE USE AND OPEN BOX AND SO DIRTY LIKE IT ...,I DONT USUALLY WRITE A REVIEW BUT THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE!!!!! I BOUGHT THIS TO GIVE IT TO MY BROTHER AS A GIFT BUT THIS IS WHAT I GOT!!!! LOOKS LIKE USE AND OPEN BOX AND SO DIRTY LIKE IT FELL SOMEWHERE!!!!
5,Love it!,Great. Works as described! I cannot complain! Love it!
1,Dont Buy,"Buggy grouping system most of the time you can't team up. Old graphics, terrible FOV, boring game play, storyline that you can't feel for it except being an annoying task, expensive micro transactions that is pretty much pointless as you still need resources to craft them, immense amount of bugs. DO NOT BUY YOU WILL BE BORED TO DEATH."
4,Instalation Instructions are not clear.,Having used Microsoft Flight Sim this seems to have the same quality and look which is a big plus.  I did have a problem understanding the installation instructions. Part of the instructions seemed contradicting other parts of the instructions.  I ended up dumping the instructions and used trial and error and my own intuition to install the program.
1,thanks amazing. you really know how to please,"They gave me an email for the game, and it was expired. thanks amazing. you really know how to please."
5,Thrustmaster Baby,Sweet collect from thrustmaster bought the FXx wheel and a playseat gran tourismo seat and shifter  and H shifter to complete my set up
5,Wide-Screen and works with Windows 8,"I waited for Amazon to get this Hidden Object Collection Treasure Trove Vol 2 in stock, and it certainly has not disappointed.  It contains ten games with many hidden objects in lots of scenes.  There is a mix of difficulty in finding the objects.  Most of them are middle of the line easy to find, but then, there are some that are harder.  There are neat mini games to play as well.  The best thing I found about the collection is it works with Windows 8 and you can install as many games as you like at a time. I have installed only one game so far, and the scenes are beautifully wide-screen and completely fill up my 24 inch monitor without stretching.  If you like hidden object games, there are hours of fun to be had with this collection, and it is much more economical than purchasing each game individually."
4,Great interactive form of the book,"If you like the book, you will see the CD-ROM as the book brought to life.  My 2 year old loves it and needs minimal help to use it.  It isn't the flashy software that is out there these days and but there are several parts of it with the song...Ray Charles and then another version. That is their favorite part.  Or you can choose instruments to play along with the song (requires them to use the keyboard), reads the story to them, and a silly sentence for each letter of the alphabet section.  I also used this in my first grade classroom and the kids loved it.  The song and the book-reading were their favorites.  I also like that the CD-ROMS generally have lower system requirements, making it easy to set up in the playroom on our older computer."
5,Took awhile to set up. There is a video ...,Took awhile to set up. There is a video on YouTube on how to work it. I purchased it directly from hyperkin.i have the micro usb model. So it works with my s7 edge and note 5. Sure you could get an emulator but the buttons and the ability to use your old cartridges are what makes it worth it.
1,Didn't get everything that I paid for.,"Paid for car packs with the limited edition.  Did not get any of the cars within the packs, any of the tokens, or the crown by my name for VIP.  This is garbage.  Turn 10 is doing nothing to fix it.  No updates on the forums, nothing.  You have my money through Amazon, why don't I have what I paid for?"
5,Fun Diversion from Sim 3,"I really like this expansion pack. For one thing, while your sims are on ""vacation"" you can bring their skill-building books, etc. and then they have virtually unlimited time to max up abilities. When you leave regular Simland, you return at exactly the same time of day and day you left, as if you never left at all, even if you were gone weeks. Another neat thing is that there are an enormous amount of adventures. It is hard to complete even one or two in one trip. I've taken one trip to France, two to Egypt and one to China and only got Visa level 1 out of 10 levels.. and that's just for one sim. I imagine it would take many generations of sims to experience all the adventures. You also get cool unique items from your travels and two new hobbies: nectar (wine) making and martial-arts. I feel this is an excellent addition to Sims 3, esp for when you've played a long time (as I have) and gotten kind of bored. It spices things up!"
5,Spyro Series 2  finally!,Been waiting on this one to come out.  The main reason for Skylanders was Spyro.  Remains one of my favorite characters and I love the new sculpt.
5,Happy with product,Value for money and easy to install. Can finally play games with the Kinect.
2,Key caps surface is falling apart,"Keyboard feels well built and comfortable, it is an excellent keyboard, unfortunately, after just a couple of months with it with daily use, not gaming just regular office work, the key cap surface is falling apart for a couple of keys, you don't want neither expect that for a two months old keyboard, and that is something I cannot judge well for a high price product, I don't like it, and I would go for another keyboard because of this quality flaw."
1,Rendered unplayable by bugs,"It gives me great pain to give this game such a low score as I'm a huge fan of the Splinter Cell franchise, but unfortunately the PC version is so buggy I am as of yet unable to play the game, and will be until a patch is released. I have a new Nvidia 8800 GTS video card, and the game won't even launch with it, so be advised not to buy this until there's another patch that fixes the issues. And even if you don't have an G 80 series video card, I would really recommend searching the internet and support forums to see if if people with hardware similar to yours are having problems. You cannot trust in this game to run on your computer, no matter how modern your system is, so do some research before you buy!"
5,Assassin's Creed III,I've played this on Xbox 360 and this version looks identical. The game pad displays the games cut scenes and a map during gameplay. This is a great launch title and definitely a good game to show some of the potential of the Wii U.
2,Reading Tutor,"I thought this would be a great tool to help my daughter with reading, but it is definitely not what I expected. The areas that are covered in this game are no where close to what she is learning in school (kindergarten). The part where she can record her voice while retelling the story was neat at first, but instead of learning the words in the story, my daughter easily memorized it. My daughter played this game for the first couple of weeks after I gave it to her, and hasn't played with it since."
5,Better than the other cooling systems..,If you need to get a PS5 cooling system this is better than the ones that are being advertised because of the suction and it blows the hot air out of the front of the cooling system.. so it takes the heat from the PS5 and it comes out the front of the cooling system to where if you look at the others they're blowing the hot air into the PS5 so make sure you read the descriptions on the PS5 cooling system to make sure it's doing what you wanted to do..
5,wprth every penny!,I bought mine from GameStop. Not Amazon. But Astros make an incredible headset. I was truly impressed by the headset. I used to use turtle beaches for both 360 and Xbox one. Now I use my halo edition a50's. Works on 360 too. As long as you have the chat adapter for 360. Halo 5 guardians beta is incredible using this headset
5,Not bad!,"This is my first mechanical keyboard, so take this review with that in mind.  Package indicated this is a Sunsonny. It appears to be nearly identical to that ""Holiday Sale Deep Discount"" one that pops up on here.  It's quite heavy and I'm loving the feeling of most of the keys (the space bar feels and sounds a tad different).  I can confirm that the switches are brown in color. The packaging had some amusingly poor English translations on it that were a fun laugh. No instructions for the different lighting settings are included, but you can find them here on the product page as of now.  I don't love the font, and may swap out the caps. Overall, I think it's a perfect first mechanical for me."
4,Nice addition,"The mod kit works well.  It keeps the sound in and enhances the overall sound.  The ear cups are very nice and attach very easy.  The top piece is a pain to get on and has a cheap plastic look that looks scratched up, a matte type finish would have been better.  I'm happy with the product overall however feel that this could have been included considering the price of the headset."
1,not a fun game. controls are terrible,"you must have the dexterity of a pianist to master this metroid, and it sucks all the fun out of it. I made it to the final boss and gave up. not worth the hell it puts you through. I love hard games, 1000s of hours in dark souls and bloodborne but this metroid was not a fun experience."
1,I really was disappointed. EA,"I really was disappointed. EA, I've been waiting for this game for years, and what you gave us was a joke for 70.00. And seriously, NO TODDLERS?! What were you thinking?!?"
1,What a bummer!,Broken Disc Drive that just grinds on my day one edition. To return and just get money back or get replacement is the question???
1,BUYER BEWARE!!!,Buyer beware!!! This product is disgusting it was covered in grime and sticky residue when i opened it. The ds slot did not work at first i had to clean it out my self to get it working. All in all this product is not (renewed) as it says it was. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!! You can find the same thing on ebay for 20 bucks. THIS IS A RIP OFF!!!!
4,"New to the series, this game doesn't disappoint.","Game is great, visuals are great, it's a nice change of pace fps from call of duty. I was a xbox guy last generation but made the switch to ps4, this game is kind of like halo, not as good, but a good substitute. Better than what it has been reviewed by the so-called experts. I haven't beaten the game but it's challenging and overall, a good time. The multiplayer is something you must try if you pick this up. Very fun!"
1,Garbage do not buy this,Do not buy this this breaks your switch.  After using this for a little over an hour the tablet started acting really funny I restarted it and went to a blue screen I tried all steps that Nintendo talks about includ ing my battery completely die out but still gets the blue screen of death and fried the charge chip do not use this if you value your switch do not use this buy a official charger I learned the hard way. Because of this my Nintendo switch is broken thanks a lot guys for breaking my switch.
5,Love love love it,OMG I LOVE the new set.  feels like you're in a real band. Good clean fun for the whole family. upgraded cymbals and it's even better.
5,Great controller,The best controller I brought thx
5,Call of Cthulhu is a very good game.,I started playing this game yesterday and I really enjoyed the gameplay. I like solving mysteries because I'm okay with not fighting or shooting on my own. This is a great survival horror game and it is so true that a lot of people suffer from delusions and it is very essential to talk about it with someone than just keeping it to yourself. The more you talk about what is bothering you the more you will feel better about yourself because it is no longer weighing on your life.
5,Cheap and good cua,I like this battery because they where cheap and 2 of them came together
2,Disappointed,"We were not satisfied with this purchase, the game door would not open on its own, we had to in some cases pry it open. Could not get the controller to connect to the system, followed what directions we could seeing as how it came with limited directions. Retuned for refund."
5,Works as advertised!,"I got tired of going through batteries or pulling battery packs out to charge them. So far this charging station has been excellent.  I keep two controllers charged at all times, so I never have to worry about batteries again!"
1,Does NOT fit the Arctis 7.,Does NOT fit the Arctis 7. Stretches to fit between the holes on each side but not over the headband.
1,item won't load,Item won't load on my xbox.
1,One use,The makeover ticket is a single use only.  You download it and you can only change the way your character looks once and then you need a new ticket.
5,DON'T BUY THIS GAME (Reverse psychology intended),"I pre-ordered the game as soon as it was available, since i had been waiting for it for years.  During the time i was waiting for it to come out, i watched many videos where the creators were interviewed, and ones where they showed demos of the game.  From my point of view, the game is exactly what the creators said it would be.  I believe it wasn't advertised as a game where you could meet up with players and explore together, and although they were frequently asked whether there would be some way to compete against other players, i don't think they ever said yes.  I understand that many things were said about the game before it came out, and even then some people were already saying it wouldn't live up to its expectations.  If that is true, I believe it is because people set their expectations too high.  The most wondrous aspect of this game for me is that, having been created by a small group of people, it's larger than possibly any game ever created.  I admit it could get dull for some people to wander around, seemingly aimlessly.  But there's more to the game than just a bunch of planets to walk on.  As you play, you'll come across creatures that might want to attack you, or ruins that melt away to reveal hidden treasures.  You'll learn alien languages and scavenge resources to survive in extreme conditions.  You'll speed across the stars and make your way to the mysterious center of the galaxy.  I think that's what the game's supposed to be about.  I wouldn't recommend calling the creators liars either.  I'm pretty sure it's hard enough to make a game that big the way you wanted to.  To make it harder by complaining about how much more it could be doesn't make much sense to me.  To wrap up I'd like to say I knew I'd like this game before I bought it and I would recommend it to anyone, but probably not everyone will like it.  Also, I just kind of rambled on writing whatever came across my mind...  Just thought people could use a review that's not overly pessimistic.  I might not be the most unbiased reviewer but I'd like for you to think I'm being optimistic about a game that has lots to offer."
5,Perfect.,Fits my 3ds perfectly. It wont fall out even if i shake it hard. I gave some to my friends and they love this as well! Better then any other one i ever had.
5,Oculus case vs JSVER case,"Here are photos of my daughters Oculus case and my JSVER case in a side by side comparison of both cases.  The Oculus case has a small compartment that is hidden under the hand controllers storage space for cables and plug..  The JSVER has flexible netting on the underside of lid top for store charging cables and plug.  The JSVER also has an elastic clip band that stretches through the headset to hold everything in place. The Oculus case does not.  The Oculus is a little smaller in size and has a hand strap for carrying.  The JSVER has a nylon handle, that has a flexible rubber cover.  IMO the JSVER offers more storage, protection and comfort.  I feel like I got more for my money going with the JSVER."
5,Great for gamers,My 10-year-old is a gamer and loves this keyboard.
5,"Different than my last one, but better",Had to replace my old rechargeable battery stand and this looked quite similar. But when it arrived I realized it was better. The battery isn't separate from the casing. It's all one part and it is quite  easy to set up. Battery charge life is great.
5,Closest Alternative to the Oculus Cable in Design. Seems to be Good Quality. Works Just Fine.,"At about half the price of the Oculus cable, and the only alternative cable with an almost identical 90deg usbc (if not identical), this cable was the best alternative I came across. The cable works just fine so far. Just remember to enable PC gameplay, so it's not just a charging. It does work, if you go through the setup properly. Nice and thick, with a 90deg usbc that seems sturdy enough, and lower profile than other alternatives. Comes with a cable strap, to secure the cable so as not to put torque ""forces"" on your Oculus usbc port. Grab this cable if you want to save some money, vs the Oculus cable. Although, I don't have the Oculus cable for direct comparison, this cable seems to be close in design, and equal in performance. Offering the same gen usbc. Be sure your PC has a usbc port as well, if you plan to buy. Or, purchase a usba adapter. It's all about the data speeds of your PC's usb port at this point. Have fun!"
5,Its works perfectly for your Nintendo switch.,It's worked perfectly.  I'm very happy with the purchase. Its works as good as the one that came with the switch.
5,Kirby!!!,"Such a fun game!!! It's true it is easy. But this is a game meant for all ages from young kids to your grandparents. It's not for you hardcore gamers out there. The controls are very straight forward and simplistic enough that anyone can pick it up and have a good time. The story mode is just long enough that anyone can complete it within a few days without feeling like it drags on. I know the length can also be a complaint, but all Kirby games are like this. They have a lot of replayability due to his different abilities and using different techniques for each play through. I very much enjoy this game and would recommend it to anyone who owns a switch."
5,A must buy for PSVR owners!,"Love it.  Perfect for halloween, perfect for demonstrating the beauty of the PSVR unit.  Sure it's a simple rail-shooter but it's so much fun and maybe, just maybe... a little on the scary side too.  I picked up six different PSVR games as soon as the PSVR came out and this one is by far the one that grabbed my attention."
5,Great!,"Controllers fit snugly, very comfortable."
5,Another Home run!!!,"Bought this game early this morning, after someone stole my mlb 10 version. As i read in another review on here with the analog stick, that person is correct, the analog stick for hitting and pitching is alittle tough at the start but after a few games its actually alot better than last years game.... The graphics compared to last years game is a touch better but isnt a huge difference.... I also have the Move with this game, which if you dont know you can only use it in the home run derby is a great add on to the game, and very tiring at that... Also has new modes and templates to create a player mode, which is one of my favorite parts to the game this year..... Overall the game adds new fresh ideas to already a great game... Overall i give it a 4.8 out of 5... Only negative for me is long load times... So if you get time to give it a try, please do :D later people"
1,I would like it but it the red dot sight hasn't turned ...,"I would like it but it the red dot sight hasn't turned on , the power indicator has but not the sight . This must be a mess up or something because I have plugged it into multiple ports and have tried both xboxs and the sight still hasn't turned on . Waste of money . Really would appreciate one that worked ."
1,Don't know how it could be any worse,"I'm older than most gamers, and my son has taken over my Xbox.  However, my age makes me a huge Star Wars fan by default, and I absolutely loved the 2004 version of this game.  I downloaded this game to my pc the first night it was released and played that first night after midnight like I was a teenager, but the spark quickly faded as this game has been nothing but a royal disappointment.  As many have pointed out, there is no campaign, but I have the same issue many people on the EA boards have been reporting.  Although my connection is fine everywhere else, I get laggy play with bad connections every single time I play this game on-line, and they do not allow you to choose a server where you connection is good.  I cannot imagine being any more disappointed than I am."
5,encore has redeemed themselves,"Encore has redeemed themselves everything is brand new. Eye catching graphics, new user interface, more and new content, more games and best of all very little break time when it loads games. Very impressive start screen, beautiful backgrounds, pleasing and easy on the eyes play area, dialog box and the Hoyle bucks total are in the start screen. In all i would recommend that every body purchase the game. Way to go Encore"
1,Not compatible with DCS World without some kind out abandoned third party software.,Product doesn't have any software. It's incompatible with most of the combat flight simulators.
5,THE BEST VIDEO GAME PLAYER I'VE EVER HAD,"My Playstation broke down in April so I had been very desperate trying to get a PS2 (I still don't have one a month after launch). But then my granpa bought me this thing to keep me happy and I love it. It plays all Playstation games and it's smaller and cuter. I never used any of the ports in the back so I don't really care about those. Even if you already own a Playstation, consider buying this after the next price drop. With the add on screen coming, Game Boy Color won't be dominating the portable game market anymore.  Oh, and the person who gave this great console 2 stars because DreamCast can play Playstation games: I don't know where you've been but Playstation2 DOES enhance Playstation games. Not by much, but it does as much as DreamCast."
5,The Switch may have put me in debt but it ...,The Switch may have put me in debt but it cleared my skin and cured my depression so buying a second set of controllers was SO worth it. Can't wait to use these puppies when Mario Kart 8 Deluxe comes out!
1,One Star,mouse were used.
4,"Fun, but gets old pretty quick","I'd heard quite a bit about Spore, so I really looked forward to getting the Creature Creator when it came out.  Amazon delivered with typical speediness.  As for the CC, it's cool, don't get me wrong.  What you can make in just a few minutes is mind boggling. Like anything though once the novelty wears off, there's really not much here.  You'd be better off download the free CC, then waiting for the game to come out."
5,Replacement screen for psp,"My son freaked when his PSP screen broke, and he figured it was time to trash his beloved game player.  I was able to find an instructional repair video on line and went looking for a replacement screen.  Turned out that Amazon beat eBay on price after adding the eBay sellers' ridiculous shipping charges, and I received the product two days after placing the order.  I felt like a hero, though at fourteen, my son managed to contain his awe of how I fixed his PSP at a fraction of its replacement cost."
1,Doesn't work with Windows 7,"I went to install it and was told that it bizarrely requires Windows 10, making it unusable for anyone with Windows 7. I have no idea what Oculus was thinking but this makes it useless. If I can find a way to actually use it I'll update."
4,ECHO -- Myst-lite in the stone age,"A good value for the price.  This is a fairly short and not too tricky game (especially if you've been playing adventure games since Zork).  It's a Myst-like game, though not nearly as challenging.  However, the paleolithic setting is unique, and the educational tie-ins were very well done.  I would definitely recommend this one, especially for 10-15 year olds."
4,Animal crossing face plates only,"I like it, except that i thought it came with a plain white faceplate as the standard with the two optional animal crossing faceplates. I really wish that nintendo would quit beating around the bush and just offer the plain black and white New Nintendo 3DS' already..."
1,THEY KILLED IT,"This series died after Call of Duty 4. That was the start of a downhill battle that the devs waged against their loyal fans and continues with call of duty black ops. To be fair, Infinity Ward, the original creators of the series made three really amazing PC shooters in the WWII genre. Skill was required, the fan base was full of people who had to, and were willing to buy a powerful PC to gain the full experience, but we were willing to do it because the games they put out were top notch. Some years ago Activision took the axe to Infinity Ward and caused the original creators to abandon the series that they perfected and their loyal fans had made so popular. When it became more profitable to focus this popular series on the consoles, that is exactly what they did. This was a huge slap in the face to all the PC gamers who have played the series since Call of Duty, which was orignially a PC exclusive. All the fame and fortune this brand now produces has created a degrading quality of game for the PC gamers that STARTED this series on it's rise to fame. PC game developers really need to look at this series and see how many PC gamers are willing to NOT buy these games anymore. Hollywood started making money and largely stopped making art. Let's not let the mighty dollar kill the great experience of PC gaming. People are spending thousands of dollars on their rigs, and yes it is a smaller market than consoles, but these people are LOYAL and can APPRECIATE good games. If you make good games for a fair price, people will have no problem buying them. Unfortunately Call of Duty: Black Ops is just another example of the stranglehold these big greedy corporations currently have on the gaming industry. Looks like i'll still be sticking with Valve and the few small game creators that are still making great games at affordable prices for the dedicated, and loyal PC gamers that still exist. We will not pay for games that are dumbed-down, over-priced, and under developed. The amazon reviews like mine make this pretty clear. Don't let the greedy corporations sell you garbage like this, if we demand games that have a learning curve that gives a high reward for success, and not just simple games for the masses, then they will deliver."
1,Disappointed,"Each page of the tutorial is so long and complicated that by the end of that page's instructions it is difficult to remember all of the points of that page's instructions.  When attempting to actually manipulate the players on the field during the learning period, the figures don't move as they are supposed to do.  I was truly disappointed in this game, overwhelmed by it and it is now not being played at all.  I found it a wast of time and money."
4,Doesnt fit elite headstrap,"Not a bad product, but just as a heads up this case will not fit the occulus 2 with the elite head strap. Kinda disappointing I have to buy a different one but thats on me for not checking first."
5,Huge set!,This set felt like Mary Poppins purse! I knew everything that was included but it felt like I  would never be done pulling everything out of the package. This set is huge and lots of things to make the switch more fun or to protect it. Super colorful accessories as well! My son loves having the little steering wheels for Mario Cart.
4,"More of the same, and that's not a bad thing","Brain Age 2 offers more of the same this time around, and if you played the original, surprise smash hit for the DS, then you'll know that this isn't a bad thing.  Brain Age 2 supplies just what the cover of the box says it does: it's more training for your brain.  The game is easy to get into for newcomers and veterans alike thanks to offering the same, simple structure as before while offering new takes on the mini-games themselves.  Combine that with some solid multiplayer capabilities, more great sudoku, and much more complicated math problems; and Brain Age 2 ends up being a winner.  The biggest flaw of Brain Age 2 however remains left over from the first game: the handwriting and speech recognition features are still somewhat shaky.  That aside though, Brain Age 2 succeeds by following the same formula as before: addictive gameplay, clean presentation, and a budget price; and in those departments alone, Brain Age 2 is worth checking out."
5,Unreal Tournament is king! Buy this game NOW!,"This is far and away one of the most addictive, hands-down BEST games I've played in quite awhile. The game design is incredible, and the game runs spectacularly even on low-end systems! The internet code is fantastic, and  the weapon balance and enviroments are mind-blowing. This game is king of  the multiplayer first-person shooters. Team Fortress 2 remains to be seen,  but unless it makes a lot of improvements over it's brethren (Tribes for  example) it may not last long. As for Quake 3 . . . from the demo, it looks  like Unreal may be the winner. It really depends on your preference - if  you want deathmatch until you die on far-out worlds battling as strange  unhuman characters, you'll probably be leaning towards Quake 3 when it  comes out. If you want lots of options, realistic enviroments and  mind-bogglingly great gameplay, graphics, and other stuff, buy Unreal  Tournament right now! It also has beautiful graphics and incredible sound.  The character models are great and flawlessly animated. You can enjoy this  game without even setting foot in an online game as well - just play  against the very-well designed bots. To close, Unreal Tournament is a  must-have game for everyone."
1,Very Lazy Capcom!,"Couldn't be bothered to include both games in the cart.  I should have done a better job at reading the box art (but maybe it wasn't there at the time I pre-ordered).  The 2nd half of this collection isn't even included you just get a code to go download, and as we all know for Nintendo that's tied to your console so if it ever breaks your out of luck and lost have of this game!!!"
1,Make Sure You Have a DVD-Rom NOT a CD-Rom,"I was very excited to get this game and the day I got it in the mail from amazon I went straight to the computer and the game simply wouldn't load. The reason is because I have a regular CD-rom not a DVD-Rom, therefore the game doesn't work. So I take it to my laptop and try it there. However, if you read the small print on the box it says it won't work with laptops because of the graphics card, so the game just ""glitches"" through everything. Overall, I was extremely excited for this game, I'm sure it's really great, but just make sure you have what you need to play it!"
5,Thumbs up.,"Item is as described, fun game."
5,Most epic keyboard ever,"I really don't know how to begin describing this keyboard... It's simply amazing. Not only it is very ergonomic and sleek but it made my Internet connection go faster, it goes beyond that. This keyboard allowed me to run Call of Duty on a 486 computer, it saved my relationship and helped me fight off the flu.  Now i got awesome abs too, otherwise why would you pay over 150 dollars for a keyboard?"
5,A great choice for Wii remote charging,This is a nice bundle...not too expensive but works very well.  The batteries fit my remotes nicely and the remotes fit comfortably in the charger. You should be aware that the charger only connects via USB but that also means you avoid yet another power-sucking power brick.
5,Great Looking Console and Graphics,"Got this bundled with NBA2K17 for the same price (299) which is buried in Amazon but is available if you search so was able to offset my cost of the console. Console so far works great, have a PS4 and can not tell the difference between the graphics on the PS and XBOX. Runs cool with no noise. The new size is great.  More importantly the console looks great, nice design and aesthetically pleasing. Bonus have a 4K blu ray player on top of a next generation console."
1,Beware,"This loyalty version does NOT work with Steam installation of the previous game(s).  Unfortunately, Amazon allows you to purchase and download at the loyalty price and you do not find out until install that it does not find any previous installs.  I am currently trying to get a refund since this is clearly false advertising.  They need to give more details on the loyalty prices for games to the customer."
2,There should be no unlocks,Paid full price and there are locked games.  Not acceptable at that price point.
5,Great headphone holder. Can hold 2 pairs.,"This is just what I needed. Holds 2 headphones depending of the thickness of the headpiece.  Easy to install. Holding up great so far. Also, the edge is sort of rounded so it is semi-safe for kids. My 2 year old bumped into it and it didn't hurt her. Not saying its completely safe, but it's safer than some of the sharper edge holders on Amazon."
5,Nice bundle,"That's a nice choice, it comes with the game and also gives you a bonus code to 3 Unlock Points to use on the weapon or ability of your choice, and also includes the Killzone 3 Retro Map Pack, featuring two of the most popular maps from Killzone 2. The box is beautiful by the way."
1,Broken out of the box.,"Came broken. Spoke to Amazon and they dont have a replacement, and they asked to contact Sony. Sony tried to rebuild database with no luck. Now they asked me to ship it to them so they can try to fix it... what a shame! will return to Amazon and get money back if they cant fix it."
5,BEST VITA RELEASE OF 2016,"Fantastic game, great release by Square Enix. Everyone is complaining that the English voice-overs were not in the game at launch but that is because of Sony restrictions on Vita cartridges. Sony only allows 4GB maximum for physical Vita releases. This was a small hickup with the lack of English VO but that was quickly fixed. They can be download in the PlayStation store."
5,Don't listen to the negative reviews! This is a solid headset!,"This headset is exponential! The sound is clear and the highs and base are well balanced. It also has great comfort for long usage. The customization is tops, with you being able to swap out the ear muffs with new ones if you feel the need to. You can also switch the mic to be on the left or right side, and you can switch the headband and tags on the earmuffs to customize the headset your way! This headset is MEANT TO LAST, as if you were to for some reason break the mic or the ear muffs were damaged or the cord was cut, you can go on Astros website and get brand new replacement parts so that the headset is good to go again! If you're looking for a mid-priced headset, go for this one, cause it's very reliable and a very excellent pick!"
1,Box was open and broken.,I bought a new Xbox because i wanted a new Xbox. The box was open and the controller was used and broken. The RB button was stuck down and i had to take apart the controller and fix it. Buy from Microsoft.
1,One Star,There is no physical game card and also redemption code doesn't work!
5,COD III essential addition,Well my step son just got PS4  and this was a must have for him. Allows him to play multiplayer campaign mode with friend with new COD III. Also allows access to new maps for multiplayer mode.
1,Garbage,Blue Flashing Light will never go away. Guess my only options are to go out of my way to send it back to get my money back and not be able to play the games I bought or go out of my way to send it back to Sony to not be able to play the games i just bought...
2,Glitchy and broken,"To begin with, the plot is convoluted and is way too much complex without being explained at the player. Leave it a mystery if you have to keep spouting insane amounts of dialogue in the first hour. Too much to follow. The framerate needs major work. The game stutters and freezes during combat and even glitches out when pausing the game.  Wait until its 20 bucks and has been patched a bunch, if you must play this game."
5,Dope,Just got mine today and I just wanna say thanks man I been tryin to get this since the day it came out and no luck you had the best price and shipped fast thanks again to all the people talking trash don't knock his hustle
5,Great bundle,I was waiting for this bundle. I was waiting for a chance to upgrade from ps3 which keep me back from the ps4 due my huge ps3 game collection.  Great buy for upgraders. Not interested in waiting for the ps4 pro which have nothing to offer for me.
1,Cheaply made,This product is a knockoff Xbox controller. Not worth the money. Too expensive for the quality of the controller.
5,Love it!!,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this headset! The color and design is BEAUTIFUL! The mic is a little far from my mouth and I've had to mess with the mic settings a little bit and I finally got it to work. It's comfortable and it beats using a Rosetta stone headset AND ear buds to be able to hear and talk to people. I recommend this headset, especially since it has a mic, audio, and a USB port."
5,Compatible with Xbox One Controller,I ordered this cable to be used with my Turtle Beach XP500 headset and it is compatible with my Xbox One controller. The cord has a 2.5 mm stereo jack to plug into the headset and a 3.5 mm stereo jack to plug directly into the controller. No additional adapters or cords are needed if your Xbox One controller already has the built-in 3.5 mm input. The older controllers without the built-in 3.5 mm input will require the talk-back adapter accessory.
4,Great game! my 4 year old loves it.,This game is alot of fun. I have a four year old and she loves Disney. Bought this game after having Just Dance Kids 2 which was terrible. Just Dance Disney does not suffer from the same problems that JDK2 did. First and most importantly the Kinect sensor is probably the most improved I have ever seen it. You can use a controller to select songs from the menu. The menu itself is very easy to use and pretty straight forward. The song selection is pretty good could always use more songs. would love a song pack in the next few weeks. I think this is by far one of the only games I found that my daughter can actually play on her own. I did have the menu freeze but was able to bypass by hitting the xbox button on the controller then canceling. If you and your child like Disney this is worth picking up.
5,Kinect Refurb is Great!,I just got my Kinect refurb yesterday! I am unable to tell the difference from this and a NEW product. The condition is excellent and everything comes factory packaged with new manuals and inserts. The Kinect even had factory stickers on it. Everything that is included with the NEW one is included with this. I have one of the first Xbox 360's and it works perfectly with the included equipment.
1,No longer fun like the original Lego games,Lego is really going down hill with their games in the last few years.  They are no longer fun to play.  You need to do things perfectly.  They are all about timing moves and very little adventure and fun.  I gave up with game after only 15 minutes as it wasn't fun.  Yet I can play the original Lego Star Wars 4-6 and Indiana Jones series over and over again.
1,Controllers do NOT work.,The controllers do NOT work. The joysticks will move in the menu but do not work in the actual game. I've never been so unhappy with a product fulfilled by Amazon. I bought this for a Christmas present and I am so upset. Complete and utter disappointment. I wish I wouldn't have got my dad's hopes up on a faulty product and wasted my time through returns.
5,Awesome Playlist!,"I got it in the mail yesterday and could not wait to get home to play it!  It has so many songs I didn't expect to be on the game.  It was nice to feel like MJ in my living room.  The warm up is ""eh"" and you have to unlock the training moves by dancing(don't you have to train before you become a pro?), but the dances are super fun and the songs are the best!  Love the game, love the music, love THE MAN!  Now back to experiencing Michael Jackson!"
1,Upset,I didnt receive my code for the gold back pack which was the whole reason I bought it off this platform
5,Nice replacement cord,I needed to replace a cheap cord that a pet chewed up. This one seems much nicer and was a great value. Works perfectly with a A40 gaming headset.
5,Worked well,Worked prefect for my 9 year old.
5,He loves it!,Great birthday gift for someone special!
5,Great cord,Nice length and great cord for what I use it for. Definitely would recommend!
5,Very good PC controller,"I was actually fairly surprised at how easily it synced to my desktop. I've had a few problems getting wireless controllers to work with it, and this did just fine. Steam picked up on it just fine and it's working rather well thus far. Much approved."
5,best since halo 1,no split screen co-op and forge wasn't released  yet but otherwise it's the best halo since the original halo 1.  best campaign since halo 1 and modernization of gameplay with sprint and mantling really improves multiplayer as well as campaign.
5,The cut scenes are long but not triangle strategy long.,LOVE THE GAME. TRIANGLE STRATEGY HAD VERY LONG CUT SCENES THIS GAMES CUTSCENES ARE MAYBE A COUPLE MINUTES LONG. TRIANGLE STRAT WAS A DRAG FOR ME BECAUSE OF HOW LONG. FELT LIKE 15 MINS ONE AFTER THE NEXT. IM GLAD THIS IS NOT THE CASE FOR TACTICS. GREAT GAME AND FUN AS THE GBA DAYS.
5,Five Stars,not comfortable. but fair for the value
1,Sigh...,"The fact I had to buy this is stupid. Microsoft, you disappoint me."
5,works great,works play on xbox one
1,Description did not match and red ring of death,Christmas day we open the product and it has red ring of death will definitely NOT be shoppinh with this merchant again ! I feel violated.
5,1 of PS2's best releases this year.,"It doesn't matter how many videos you download or how many screenshots you see you'll never know how much fun this is untill you play it. Starting off is the complex trick system. Unlike alot of snowboarding games it's easy for a beginer to pull off a basic trick, but it'll take months to master it. Next it has severall styles of riders who each have some strong and week points, and unlike alot of games there is a huge difference between them. The best part off the game is the levels. How many of you have bought a snowboarding game and found each level is going down a snow covered mountain with no difference but how difficult it is. My favorite level is a pinball machine. It has bumbers, switches, secret areas, and you get three tries (just like a pinnball machine. There is also one whhere you go down the streets of a city and if you want you can go on top of the building or even go through them. Another one of my favorites was your on an iceburg and as it moves towrds honolulu it melts finally landing you in beutiful hawai. All I can say is try to work this game in the ones you buy at launch. I found it was much more fun then TTT or Ridge Racer. The only game I liked more was Kessen and Maden 2001 (I'm a huge football fan.)"
5,This was a great deal for the price.,The game...nice addition but the PS3 gives you what you need at a reasonable price.  So far no issues at all.
1,Does not work with Windows 8,"I had the same experience as some of the other reviewers. Installed the software, which prompted a firmware update. The firmware didn't update, and the mouse became unresponsive. Submitted a support ticket, which prompted an auto-generated response saying they'll definitely get back to me within 1-2 business days. Over a week later, still no response. I'll never buy another SteelSeries product."
5,the device works great to start out with apparently we did something wrong ...,the device works great to start out with apparently we did something wrong after emailing the mod company they told us how to do a factory reset and it works perfect again thank you for all your help
5,Great case.,"First off I wana say this is a great case. Second off. I read a lot of reviews that were helpful for the slim users but none that were written for people with the 1000 series. In the photo I posted you can see my vita it's a very nice fit with no wiggle room. Very protective, the vita doesn't flop around once the case is closed. I recommend this case for anyone who wants the extra protection this case guarantees."
5,One of the best titles for the PSP,"I got this game for my Bday last night. I must say i am impressed, not very buggy,good Graphics,All right audio, and decent game play. It maybe the best PSP title out or close to the best.Daxter takes place before Jak2. Jak is inprisoned and Daxter has to Save him, Daxter takes a job as an Exterminator, so he can explore the Haven city in search of Jak. You basically just kill Bugs on every level and search for  Items(And ofcourse jak). The game play is very cool you get Upgrades as you progress through the Story and theres a cool Bug wrestling mini game and a few Dream mini games."
1,Scam for Resalers,"Don't even try to buy a PS5 it is just a Sony scam to get more money. This page has never had stuff for sale, Not even the Playstation web site."
5,Works well,Used for the Wii system when the grandkids come over. They enjoy it.
5,"Much Like the First, but Still Fun","I really enjoyed the first Lost Cases of Sherlock Holmes, so I bought the second one as soon as it was released.  I was not disappointed, and I enjoyed this game just as much as the first.  The gameplay and style are exactly the same as the first game, but the sequel offers new cases.  For those unfamiliar with the series, this is primarily a hidden object game, punctuated by logic-style puzzles at the end of each chapter.  The game features a series of Sherlock Holmes cases, and you must search a variety of locations to find clues to solve the mystery.  Each location reveals a number of potential suspects, and the conclusion involves solving a logic and memory puzzle to determine which party is guilty.  The cases are well-written, and the hidden object scenes are appropriate to the time and place in question (late-19th c. London).  The suspects are believable, and the objects one must find to discover suspects are appropriate to the story (perfume bottles for the mistress of a prominent politician, for example).  Those who enjoyed the first game will certainly want to play the second.  Don't expect innovation, just more of what made the first game fun.  This is definitely one of the more fulfilling hidden object games I've played recently."
5,You need tools? Get these,Im always customizing my things so i needed some new tools. This little box has everything you need for nintendo products and more :)
5,Amazing sound!,These  have amazing sound on Xbox one! You can hear foot steps in Battlefield 1 and all the guns sound amazing. When playing it has different settings so you can set it up for FPS or RPG's. You can hook them up to the computer and adjust so many different settings. They are very comfortable and fit great. The battery life is pretty good too. Usually last a couple days before we have to put them on the charger. They are completely wireless too. I'd definitely recommend them.
5,Worked Great.,"In the images the Blue is the OEM joystick and the green cable is the new ones. The green cabled ones have a hard piece of plastic to allow it to be inserted into the connector easier, which worked great on one of the joysticks. On the other the little hard piece fell off, but the seller immediately turned around and shipped me replacements. There were no directions included but a simple youtube search taught me what i needed."
1,A worthless piece of junk.,"Why would you spend money on this, especially since you're Nintendo DS comes with Pictochat, which is far superior. I'm just warning you not to waste your money on this worthless piece of junk."
5,Good,Still have my ps2 and it worked good for it
5,... it not working on next gen but it works fine for,The grips fit perfectly on my joysticks I saw that many people complained about it not working on next gen but it works fine for me
1,After a painful 1. 5 hour download of the update my ...,"I've been a halo user since the beginning. Advanced purchased this and it arrived today. After a painful 1.5 hour download of the update my son and I realized no split screen co-op! Are you kidding me! This has definitely ruined our love of the halo game franchise. Microsoft should be ashamed that the left out the one thing that made halo great, and that was the split screen play. Sending this back in the morning. Terrible."
1,Love the Sim Games,"I've been an avid fan of sim games in general and was really looking forward to Spore but the included DRM ""feature"" just kills it for me.  I've made the the mistake of thinking that since I didn't pirate the game the DRM wouldn't effect me one too many times (Neverwinter Nights 2 I'm looking at you).  I just can't imagine purchasing a game with an installed DRM component or excessive limitations on use.  I hope that EA reconsiders so that I can buy what looks like a truly wonderful game."
5,Sony did it right with these!,"I have always used Turtle Beach gaming headsets which are good but always fall apart and break. I was a little skeptical about purchasing outside my normal and couldn't be happier with these headsets. The microphone works great in my online parties playing games with friends, they hear me loud and clear. You simply turn on the headset and sound is transferred to the headphones and when you turn them off the sound goes back to your normal speakers your using hooked up to your tv or console which in my case a sound bar. Games sound really good in these. I'm impressed and I highly recommend them to all PS4 gamers online or offline."
1,Poorly charges the Nintendo Switch console,"Poorly charges the Nintendo Switch, not officially licensed by Nintendo.  This charger in no way provides enough power to use the unit while charging, it can take 8-9 hours to fully recharge the battery.  You are better off buying the official Nintendo AC Adapter.  Avoid."
4,Good but not great,"I got this thing so that I could spend more time with my friends online during longer sessions without tying myself to a cord and thus the wall. The product fits snug into the side of the Meta Quest and does provide a little bit of a weight imbalance. You'll know it's there by the feel but it's just like regularly strapping a large piece of plastic to your face; you'll get used to it with time. The charge it holds itself is decent but it's not effective enough for a long term solution. It maybe gives you an extra hour to an hour and a half of play and you need to make sure you employ it before you really need it in my experience due to the charge being so slow to process. It's helped me a bit but also frustrated me as I struggle to put it on in time to save myself only to have my headset die. I'm sure there are better battery solutions out there but, for the price I paid, it's decent enough."
5,Works like it's supposed to,I have the Elite series 2 and it works perfectly. (Be sure to update through Brook's website and select controller compatibility update). After updating I can finally use my new elite on my PS4 pro.
1,After a month controller stick drifts,After a month controller stick drifts. I want my money back or a replacement. Amazon wont let me return it.
5,Five Stars,as described and arrived on time
5,May The Father Of Understanding Guide Us,"Wow.  I am extremely impressed with not only how great this game looks. (for a last gen game) but also with the frame rate.  I played AC4 Black Flag on the PS4, and I can say this.  This game holds up extremely well, and I don't feel like it is a downgrade.  I mean I do not know how Black Flag performed on last gen, but the fact that this game has such a smooth frame rate is really impressive too me.  I just can't get over how smooth it is...wow.  The story is fantastic, and the characters are also great.  Achilles, Haytham, and Shay are basically badass's, and well they are extremely likable.  The locations are also very well done and filled with detail.  I just wanted to give this game a good review ,because I chose to get this over Unity, and all I can say is that it really surprised and impressed me.  WIthout question, buy this game.  It has one of the best stories in the AC franchise, though I wish it was a bit longer.  Anyway, if you were a person that was unsure about this game, as I was, don't be, and go ahead and buy the game.  You will not be disappointed."
2,Pass on this one,"Of all the Spyro games this one has to be the worst one yet. I did not mind that he is in Crashes world however, they did not have to make it 2 dimensional. Spyro can only go 180 degrees not the 360 that he is able to do in his outher ones. And each level has the same challanges, that's no challange."
5,Best Purchase Yet!,"This is a great case, not big or bulky and makes the switch feel better as a whole. The extra grip on the back makes handheld mode a lot more comfortable. It has made my switch feel a lot less fragile and it I think it looks great. While it is a little snug it still fits in the official Nintendo Switch Game Traveler Case, which is great! Definitely one of my best purchases for the Switch yet!"
1,A gaming loss,"I have purchased every edition of Civilization, finding that it is one of the rare games that I return to very often.  I was looking forward to this new edition to the extent that I pre ordered it.  Perhaps the game if played is wothy of many stars, but I may never know.  WARNING, do not get this game without a very new very powerfull computer !!.  It will not run on a two year old (then state of the gaming art) at all.  I spent many hours trying to get it to run with no success.  Also you cannot run the game except through an internet connection called Steam.  That setrvuice may be fine for social gaming, but not what I want.  I am very dissapointed in Sid Meier, Fixaxis and 2K for publishing this game as it did."
1,Hardware Disaster,"This system has an inordinate amount of hardware failures, most occur after firmware updates that are essentially forced on the consumer. Sony refuses to accept responsibility for this and they have more than one class action suit they will have to face. If you are insistent on purchasing this system buy it somewhere that will also sell you an extended warranty with it."
1,Do not buy this game!!! It is ...,Do not buy this game!!! It is free on xbox live which you have to have to play anyway!!!!
5,Great for bigger fingers,Great product! We played Mario Kart 8 with these and they worked perfectly!
4,Works Fine with Nintendo Wii (RVL-001 with GameCube ports),"I have a Nintendo Wii Console (Model RVL-001 with GameCube ports) and needed a replacement controller. ThIs aftermarket controller works fine with the few games we play on the Game Cube side of the Wii. The price is right,  no issues. It did come loose (no retail package ) just  in a plastic bag with bubble wrap inside an Amazon box. Looks new though"
4,Great value,For the price there isn't much to complain about here. The buttons all work and it's nice not having to fumble around for a charge cable or spare battery. The only real downsides mostly stem from the construction: the cable is long but not a great length unless you have the space for it and the triggers are a little squeaky. These are pretty minor gripes considering the price difference between this and an official controller from Microsoft
5,"This is great for anyone who likes Limbo or Inside, the design is spectacular","The atmosphere is intense, the music dread inducing and the lights flicker. You'll feel a sense of uneasiness, its great"
1,Do not buy- Card not valid,Code did not work.  Tried multiple times and received a may no longer be valide error message.
4,Terribly underrated FPS,"Those who enjoyed venturing into arcades in the past decade will no doubt remember Midway's light gun shooter Area 51; a cumbersome and buggy game where you took on hordes of aliens and mutated beasts at the famously secretive government research facility.  Fast forward to today, and Midway has totally restructured Area 51 from the inside out, this time around as a straight forward FPS.  The storyline relatively stays the same, you play as Ethan Cole (voiced by David Duchovny), the lone survivor of a Haz-Mat team sent to investigate strange goings on at the research facility.  As you venture through the game's levels, you learn of vast government and alien conspiracies, and when you get far enough, you find yourself turning into one of them.  This element adds a fun dimension to the gameplay, allowing you to melee your enemies to death and fire off parasites to infect them.  In addition to this feature, the standard FPS rules apply as you pick up a bevy of weapons and grenades to take out the hideous beings roaming in the underground of Area 51.  The game's storyline packs in as much conspiracy-laden material as it can, ranging from alien abductions to the Roswell incident where it all started, and as you progress you can locate hidden documents which allow you to unlock the many secrets of the game.  Powers Boothe and Marilyn Manson also lend their voices in addition to Duchovny, who sadly at many spots throughout the game sounds bored as he speaks.  The online multiplayer feature is what really makes Area 51 a winner, which for a PS2 game manages to provide lag-free online play, and that itself is a welcome surprise.  The graphics are unbelievably sharp for a PS2 game, with some nice lighting effects as well.  The biggest drawback of Area 51 is the difficulty as you progress to the lower levels of the game.  The farther you get, the toughter the enemies get, and the more and more sparse health and ammo get as well.  So be warned, this isn't that easy an FPS to breeze through, but the multiplayer options and the nicely designed extras and secrets make this a game worth coming back to.  All on all, Area 51 is a surprisingly great and terribly underrated FPS that stands as one of the top shooters on the PS2, and if you're an FPS fan, this is worth picking up."
5,Awesome!,"This game is great!  There are so many options to customize your home and items to buy for it.  I love being able to add swimming pools, hot tubs, and game tables.  I also like the fact that you can create a whole family including children sims unlike Sims 2 where you cannot create children sims therefore no complete family.  It's so cool though to create and build your own home and furnish it like your fantasy home.  My wife loves to design homes so she created one and as best as possible created herself and me in the game as sim characters as well as created a little girl of which we one day hope to have for real.  It's just plain ol good fun.  And very addicting.  It's so very easy to lose track of time while playing.  I highly recommend this title."
5,Works like a dream with my PSP 3001,Works like a dream with my PSP 3001 with Firmware version 6.60. I also uploaded some pictures showing the cam with my PSP. Just installed it right from the box and it worked! Video and images are good quality (like VGA). For the price it was worth trying and it works.
5,Works quietly and runs warm not hot,"So far so good. This power supply is not loud, only gets warm and not hot. I searched through many different power bricks on the market and many had horror stories of super loud fans, melting, and even catching fire. I have no concerns so far with this power supply and its probably the only one I found that did not have any bad reviews. After 1.5 weeks of heavy use there are no problems. Recommended!"
5,Good product!,"Works great! A lil hard to put on, but fits well!"
5,A great workout without even knowing you're exercising!,I plugged this into the wii to check it out and about 10 minutes later I was out of breath...but I kept going because it was so fun.  Then I challenged the spouse and we both danced for at least another 30 mins.  I didn't realize how much time had gone by because we were having so much fun trying to beat each other!  I admit...it' totally cheese and the graphics are not very good...but who cares - it's a great workout without even thinking about exercising!  I love it!
1,Left important details out of the amazon info.,"I bought this for my father for Christmas, always use to play it with me when I was little, a great memory type gift. Hes an older guy and stuck in his way especially when it comes to computers. I do not see where it says steam is needed anywhere on the sales page. Meaning my father won't be able to play it because he doesn't trust it. Way to ruin Christmas."
5,Very useful..,"Ever just get the urge to..play a game? Not worry about having to die? Or just feel like you need extra help? Well rub the magic game genie cart..wait, better yet--input the codes (included in a book that comes with it) to make your game play more enjoyable! It's a nice thing to have."
5,Awesome.,Awesome for my kids.
5,WOW! FFXVI is Amazing,"Final Fantasy XVI delivers a captivating and darkly immersive experience. The story is gripping, featuring complex characters and a richly woven narrative. The combat system strikes a perfect balance between traditional and modern, offering strategic depth and fluid action. The visuals are stunning, showcasing breathtaking environments and detailed character designs. The soundtrack is masterfully composed, enhancing the emotional depth of each moment. Final Fantasy XVI is a triumphant return to form for the series, providing an unforgettable journey filled with intrigue, adventure, and heart."
4,Some of us did miss this game the first time,"Crazy Taxi is a whole lot of fun, and if you never bought a Dreamcast--as many of us didn't, including me--this is your chance to own the best arcade racer in years, with slightly improved graphics. What I like best about it is that it's oldschool arcade-style play: there's no end and no goal, except to rack up the highest score (the most money) that you possibly can. If you're a fan of wild arcade-style racing, don't hesitate to buy this game!"
5,Good Replacement,Lost Samsung cord in a move. This one works great in its place
1,You almost had it,The major complaint I have is the roster it is straight garbage. Why do we have to buy Venom?Who the hell wants to play as Spencer? Did we really need all the Guardians of the Galaxy? I know they can't use them but where the hell are the X-Men(gamer tears). They still had so much to work with what happened!!! I feel like I wasted my money getting the Deluxe pack. And now knowing they aren't even gonna bring in more characters I'm feeling straight buyer regret on this one. I literally stopped playing it like 2 months after the release.If i had the choice I would want a full refund!!! 1  star since half is not an option.
5,Works for loading Swiss or GBI from Action Replay,"Works for loading Swiss or GBI from Action Replay. Make sure your sd card is formatted correctly and that it's a sd, not sdhc, card."
1,Almost Perfect,Everything worked except for the two digital download codes. So I would either avoid this seller or this specific bundle.
5,Cool mixture of adventure and puzzle game !,"This is a really good adventure game. Interesting puzzle and riddles, good story and cool graphics. Altogether -  I really did enjoy playing it although the game could be a bit longer. After  story, there are also quick play (hidden world) and minigames (all of this unlocked while you complete the story) that allows to play with the game a bit longer. Anyway - good fun and my recommendation !"
1,Return Please,"I can't help but agree with the comments here. Instead of feeling like an owner of an exciting game, I feel like a criminal. And of course you can't return the thing since the seal is broken. Grats EA on robbing me. What a fool I am."
5,One of the best pet simulators?,"Nintendogs ushers in a new era of handheld pet simulators with crisp, fresh graphics, touch screen interaction and voice recognition. In Nintendogs, you first have to decide which puppie you want (each version has diiferent breeds). Then, you raise the puppie and feed it, give it water, wash it, play with it, and train it. The game is real time, so you can't completely forget your dog for weeks without it completely disliking you. You use the stylus to play and pet your dog, and certain strokes of it will cause the dog to sit, lay down, etc. While doing the stroke, you can say the command (for example, rub you stylus across the dog's back and it will sit, if you say sit when you do the stroke, it will learn that you saying sit means to sit.) Nintendogs look like an incredible game and truly shows the power ofthe Nintendo DS."
1,No DLCs,"Great game, but does not include the 3 add on DLCs as advertised."
2,Disappointed,"You don't really get 30 games, you have to play and get stars to access the games. Very disappointed"
1,One Star,Cool product but there was a monster in box. Would not buy again. Would not recommend.
5,Please do not get the ds to replace the sp,Please Do not listen to other people that say that the ds will replace the gameboy advanced sp because the ds does not have a port on the back of it to plug in the link cable so that means you cannot play multiplayer with other sp's.Anyway the sp is a very good machine it has a built in light witch is great for long car rides in the dark and the sp has a rechargable batery so you dont have to constantly go to the store and buy batteries for it.
5,Super bright and cool LEDs,"If you have enough patience, experience, and a steady hand than you should definitely put these in your controller, way better than the boring old green lights. It only comes with 4 so if you loose one then you'll have to order some more and its insanely easy to loose these. Just one little breath could send one of the sand grain sized LEDs lost forever so i suggest you work over a large baking pan or something like that. You'll need a soldering iron around 30W or else you could damage your LEDs or controller. Otherwise i recommend you get these to spice up your controller. I'll put up some pics of my perty controller."
5,Burger Shop is fun!,"I 1st played this game as a 60 min trial I downloaded. I liked it so much so I bought it online. There are many different types of food to serve the customers like chicken sandwiches,soda,fries,ice cream etc.You can play in story mode or an endless mode(which can be addicting!) If you like to play food games like I do than you will like this game."
1,Worse than a gift certificate,"I bought this for my son for Christmas. He kept in on his desk until he was ready to use it (this week). These cards are on flimsy cardboard and when he went to remove the covering over the redemption code most of the number came off. It was not legible.  We just need the code. Don't want our money back. But nope...He found out it was defective after the 30 day ""return"" policy. Adler told us to go to Sony and Sony told us to go to Adler. Out 80 bucks due to two companies who cant see the color ""grey"" and just do the right thing. What customer service?...."
5,Great buy!,"What a find, to replace a lost charger.  Great price and works great."
5,An Overall Solid Game,"I usually play mostly rpgs, but I decided to try this game on account that I played both knights of the old republic one and two respectively. So based upon that, I really enjoyed playing this game. It had rpg elements for those who like rpgs, but it also has a solid base in MMOs with pvps and group quests (known as flashpoints). Replay value wise, I would say is high because all the variety of classes are interconnected in one way or another. For example, a companion on the Republic side might known someone the player meets on the Imperial side and vice versa. I would personally suggest you wait for it to go free to play this fall if you are hesitant about it, but if you are one of the people who had hoped for Knights of the Old republic 3 or just looking for a new game, I'd say get it now. At least you get 30 days free. In the end I'd say not to listen to the naysayers, for the price if you hate it your'e not out a lot of money and if you love it, you got it for a steal."
5,Works great and is cheap!,Works great and is cheap!
4,Good for ages 5-7,"My daughters ages 5 and 7 each received Nintendo DS game systems for Christmas.  The games they received: the Little Mermaid, That's So Raven, Barbie 12 Dancing Princesses and Hannah Montana, turned out to be quite difficult for them.  StrawberryLand is alot of fun for my 5 yr old.  The dialog directions are quite lengthy and she can't read, but the game play is fun. Since Strawberry Shortcake is generally for girls in the pre-K, younger elem age group, the game is age appropriate.  Older girls who can read better may find it too easy.  Less dialog would have earned 5 stars for this game."
1,Not Good,"I had an older version of this game, and like it much better.  You can't raise on BlackJack as high as I would like to, as in the past.  Also on the poker games, I couldn't even see what cards I had.  Good thing it wasn't too expensive.  I uninstalled it and tossed it into the garbage!"
1,180 degree change in design philosophy without consulting playerbase.,"This game has recently introduced a gear grind mechanism based on resistance gear sets (reminiscent of other MMOs?).  Even more importantly, this new gear tier has significantly improved base stats over the previous best in slot gear.  In other MMOs this so-called vertical gear progression is the common modus operandi; however, Guild Wars 2 has always marketed itself based on claims that it would avoid this type of gameplay.  My assessment is that the developers ArenaNet have betrayed their loyal consumers in an attempt to create larger profit margins for their backers at NCSoft."
5,you know you're gonna buy it,"I have skyrim on like 5 different platforms, it's a great game, and as much as I say I won't get it on another, I always do."
4,It's a good mouse for a gaming mouse but i've been using ...,It's a good mouse for a gaming mouse but i've been using the mouse for a few days and the left side of the mouse side grip is starting to peel which had me concerning that it's going to get worse overtime so i was wondering if you guys could send me a new replacement one because i paid for price of the mouse and i do not want to be upset with this product... I posted some pictures below to show proof it that the side grip is starting to peel. Thank you and please respond back ASAP.
1,Beware what you're buying,"I bought this remote in the hopes that the sleek, modern design would make this a welcome addition to my PS3.  It turned out to be a complete waste of money.  This product is cheaply made out of flimsy plastic.  I could actually feel the plastic warp as I slid the top down to access the other buttons.  The charging stand was also a complete disappointment.  my remote would never actually make a connection to the charging stand unless you held the remote down firmly with you hand.  This was due to the fact that the stand was made just as flimsily and cheaply as the remote itself.  Along with a price that is more than the standard Sony remote, I would tell you that you are better off using your PS3 remote than this product."
5,IT ACTUALLY WORKS! DISREGARD THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS,"I got this for a game cube I had just recently purchased because the cords I had were no longer working and there was no audio. Despite the negative reviews, I took a chance and purchased this and everything is working perfectly! Sound, picture, there are no connection problems at all. For the reviews stating that the cord does not work, they must not have connected it properly or maybe their game system is the main issue because I can assure you, this cord works fine. If you need it buy it, you will be happy you did."
1,Does not fit my Sony PlayStation 4.,Product does not fit my Sony PlayStation 4. My PlayStation is not described as Pro or Slim. Rather my console is described on the original box as Sony PlayStation 4 and this product blocks every port on the console rendering it impossible to use. After plugging it into the USB the fans turn but I can not use this product and I would really like to return it and get my money back.
1,Joystick is worthless.,"I bought this item two days ago and wrote a review on it (same controller but different box, thats how I can write two about the same product).  I gave it three stars out of five because the joystick was too sensitive and my on-screen character would start moving around randomly throughout the game which made it really hard when you wanted to shoot something.  Well, two days later the joystick does not work.  You have to push forward to go right and backward to go left (and that only works sometimes - I don't know how to go forward or backward).  I bought this remote brand new and still in a case so I certainly hope this is just a faulty remote because three more are on there way that I didn't get canceled in time.  I wanted this kind of remote for my N64 because it was new and I could not find new originals anywhere, however I think that buying a used good remote would be better than buying a new bad remote."
2,WHAT DID THEY DO?!?!?,"As with some of the other comments, this game is a bit of a disappointment, especially if you ever played any of the previous games.  They got rid of all the fun AI characters like Roswell and Harley the Bear and replaced them with some really poorly animated characters.  You also lose access to choosing your opponents and it seems like a lot of the features that grew through the 2012 version were thrown out.  The voices are also pretty horrible.  I sound robotic and are completely off sync with the graphics on their mouth.  The only saving grace for this game for me is it is still one of the better computer games for pinochle out there.  Besides that this game is rather disappointing.  Purchase at your own risk and would not recommend anyone buy this if you're used to the older versions."
1,Definitely a sucker punch from EA,"Wow...I am definitely speechless...removal of franchise mode really EA?? This game is definitely catering to the online players and with me being deployed in Afghanistan without a solid internet connection and most of the time none at all the game is good for no more than being a paper weight, shame on you EA for for using all of your hardcore madden fans as toilet paper this year."
1,I remember when NFS was for people who liked car games,"No racing wheel support. No manual clutch. Why don't we just use the joysticks to navigate around a fantasy land and collect coins in the road? I remember when NFS was for people who liked car games. When they make another one of those, let me know."
5,Five Stars,Amazing!!
5,Great game works on windows 10 64 bit,Great game just how I loved it back in the day. It works on my Toshiba laptop 64 bit with Windows 10 for anyone wondering
1,One Star,used playstation in place of a new one. wasn't even reset to factory settings........for shame...........
5,If you loved the NES Mario games you will obviously be blown away,As someone who grew up with these games I was counting down waiting for this to be delivered. It is perfection. The NES Mario games all in one wonderful Wii game. My inner 10 year old is doing cartwheels. Be prepared to fight for player 1 with your loved ones.
5,Best Bluetooth Controller,Met all expectations! Awesome product! Have had no issues with pairing to my S7 and works perfectly with my Gear VR.
5,I got Sasha!!!,"The cards came safely the day after I ordered them. The seller was only allowing 1 pack per person, I'm happy I could get at least one because I'm sure I never would've gotten one otherwise."
1,BUGGY AS HELL,This thing SUCKS.  Doesn't work properly at all.  Returning.
1,Thank you,"Thank you all for the previous reviews.  I was anticipating buying the game - wish list and all that - but will avoid it given the DRM issue.  Very unfortunate, as the game itself looks wonderful...  Hopefully Ubisoft will get the message."
1,"No Disc, Only Download","Wouldn't know. The description really did not let me know it was going to be an empty case with a code to download it. We're on limited internet, so I highly doubt we'll download it. This was supposed to be for my daughter's Christmas. It really should say pretty plainly that you're not getting a disc."
1,Broken hard drive,"Broken hard drive grinding noise useless brick 2 hours waiting for msft support and got the arrogant response  ""we sold millions, yours is broken, a minority'"
1,Extremely bad conditions,Extremely bad conditions.
1,Arrived Broken,The second row of video games arrived broken off.  I just took it out and my son uses the first one.  I guess you get what you pay for.
5,Unreal Tournament is king! Buy this game NOW!,"This is far and away one of the most addictive, hands-down BEST games I've played in quite awhile. The game design is incredible, and the game runs spectacularly even on low-end systems! The internet code is fantastic, and  the weapon balance and enviroments are mind-blowing. This game is king of  the multiplayer first-person shooters. Team Fortress 2 remains to be seen,  but unless it makes a lot of improvements over it's brethren (Tribes for  example) it may not last long. As for Quake 3 . . . from the demo, it looks  like Unreal may be the winner. It really depends on your preference - if  you want deathmatch until you die on far-out worlds battling as strange  unhuman characters, you'll probably be leaning towards Quake 3 when it  comes out. If you want lots of options, realistic enviroments and  mind-bogglingly great gameplay, graphics, and other stuff, buy Unreal  Tournament right now! It also has beautiful graphics and incredible sound.  The character models are great and flawlessly animated. You can enjoy this  game without even setting foot in an online game as well - just play  against the very-well designed bots. To close, Unreal Tournament is a  must-have game for everyone."
5,Does work with the Xbox One S Controller,"Does work with the Xbox one S controller. I read a few reviews stating it doesn't work with it. When I first put it in, I found it difficult to put the back door back on and it in fact didn't light up or anything. It rumbled, but there was no light.  I tried different ports and nothing. I took the battery out and put it back in. I made sure the connectors all touched and the battery was pushed in fully. It slid in more, then back door easily fit back on, and the light on the cord comes on now. So, makes sure the battery is in correctly and the connectors are ALL touching, or it won't charge."
5,A better way to play a classic,"Strange Journey is a black sheep in the megaten series, being released between III and IV in the series lifetime. I played the game then, when it was first released. Being a portable title in a somewhat niche genre, the game overcame obvious hardware limitations with a deep story and challenging gameplay. When compared to Nocturne, it's predecessor, it would be easy to say it was a dumbed down version of the megaten formula, when in truth it was simply more in line with the SMT I and II. The fairest comparison would be to Soul Hackers. World navigation is simplistic and static, depicted either by artistic backgrounds or slightly more three dimensional rendered environments. The same goes for talking to demons and repeating conversations. This game is not pretty. The graphics and environments are not what the game was designed with in mind. When compared to modern era games, it falls short in those categories. And for that reason, I don't recommend this if you haven't played many jrpgs. But if you love megaten, this is a perfect pick. The soundtrack is unique and haunting, though generally not very musical in nature. The plot is detailed and enjoyable, but presented primarily through blocks of text. There are many demons to recruit and a 8 remarkably dismal sectors to explore. Returning players will be immediately greeted with numerous quality of life updates such as saving in the field and fast forwarding in dialogue. There is a new character and a corresponding bonus area which unlocks 3 new endings. Players have more to do in subsequent playthroughs, can change difficulty any time in the mentioned, and can install as many apps at a time as you like. The game is by no means flawless, but I find myself having even more trouble putting it down than when I first played it 7 years ago."
5,Couldn't tell it was a refurb,"Purchased this after my corsair strafe RGB started having issues.  I was a little hesitant at first about buying a refurb, but honestly it looks and feels brand new.  I have been a loyal Logitech fan for years using their mice (MX518, G400, G-Pro), so i figured i'd give them a shot.  Very glad i did...the Roamer G switches feel amazing, i actually like them better than the Cherry MX on the strafe.  Everything just feels like it responds better.  While only cosmetic, the lighting system is much easier to use with the Logitech software as well (at least in my opinion).  Also glad to have the ten key-less model, as this saves a nice chunk of space on my desk.  Overall, super happy with this and Logitech will continue to be my go-to for peripherals."
5,You won't regret it!,"Simply put, a very, very fun game to play. If you have any doubts or are judging it by its cover, just try it. When I first saw minecraft I was a hater, I thought the graphics were bad, I thought it was the most boring game ever... Then I actually decided to try it and I instantly fell in love. It is fun for all ages and the possibilities of what you can do are near to endless. It's especially fun when you have friends to play with. Trust me on this one, you won't regret it."
5,Just makes Switch Lite Better,Looks great and feels great. Love the asymmetrical design it really does help having the right side angled like that.
5,Five Stars,It's dangerous to go alone. Take this.
4,Fits on the Razer Blackwidow V2. I have the ...,Fits on the Razer Blackwidow V2. I have the orange switches. The only complaint I have is the key cap remover will scratch the sides of your keys. invest in your own.
5,Great Charge Base!,This has to be the easiest way to charge a PS4 controller that I have seen to date. Attach the USB adapter to the controller and you are good to go! You simply drop the charger into the base and that is all! The adapter DOES NOT INTERFERE with game play at all. I highly recommend this charging base. I also put up a few pictures for you to see.
5,Way Better Than a Box,"If you take a peek at some of my other Amazon reviews it's obvious that I'm a huge fan of the Sega Dreamcast. It was the last console I believed in and felt was truly special, an experience that couldn't be replicated by Nintendo or Sony at the time on their respective machines; not for me at least. Maybe I was disappointed in Sega after their initial success with the Sega Genesis. As a company Sega was a witty and wildly eccentric, but ultimately unpredictable.  They were the Mad Hatter of the video game kingdom and lacked focus, at least for a significant amount of time, always jumping from one thing to another in the blink of an eye. To say I was disappointed in Sega after the Saturn would be a massive understatement, so when they unveiled the Dreamcast, it was like seeing a blazing phoenix rising from the ashes of defeat reborn, even if it would ultimately be their last volley into the home video game console market. I never lost faith in the Dreamcast, even as far more powerful hardware because it was magical to me. Sega, for all their failures had somehow been able to capture lightning in a bottle and sell it for a modest price. It helps that the Dreamcast was ahead of its time and well designed with its online functionality, virtual memory units, or its ability to output a razor sharp VGA signal if you had the right stuff to connect it to a computer display. This is a key feature that in my opinion helps give the system a solid pair of running legs long after its unfortunate demise because even in the age of high definition, the Sega Dreamcast looks darn good and you no longer need a rare and potentially expensive VGA box to finally see it for yourself.  I have a similar bundled cable that I purchased on Amazon, but it wasn't perfect. The VGA lacked thumb screws of the sides to help secure it to my television after it was connected and had a distinct homemade feel, something that never sat to well with me at the end of the day, even though it's a solid device. These VGA cables from Tomee are definitely a huge improvement with a quality fit and finish that blew away what I had and really surprised me, especially for a non-first party, or officially licensed product. Another thing that I liked about these is that it's coupled with a set of RCA cables for sound, and helps reduce the clutter and previous mess of wires I had to wrestle with every time I wanted to play my Sega Dreamcast.  To sum it up folks, if you still have your Dreamcast, whether it's still hooked up to your television, ready for action at a moment's notice or retired somewhere in a bedroom closet, buy these cables now, knock the dust off and take your favorite Dreamcast games for a spin down memory lane with a fresh coat of sparkling paint. If you've only previously used an R.F. adapter, composite and even s-video cables you'll either be happy and pleasantly surprised or blown away. I know that I definitely was. I can't imagine these cables lasting to long, like the Sega Dreamcast, nothing that is ever truly does."
5,Good stuff,Maybe twice have I ever got a hand written note from an Amazon order.  They even used my name.  This really tells me the care about the buyer.  Anyway.  I was looking for a GBA SP for my wife so she had something To do during her 7 hour chemo seasons.  Shipping was really fast and was packaged very well.  The game boy it's self wasn't what you would call perfect.  Few marks and scratched but I expected that.  Living in the pocket of a person isn't the most forgiving thing.  You have to remember they are not new.  I put a game in and turned it on.  Game worked.  Game boy worked.  Back light worked.  Very happy with it.  My wife was even more so.  Now she has something to keep her busy with her treatment.
5,It's Shulk Time!,This is my 3rd time playing this game since I also own the Wii and New 3ds version of this game and it's still an amazing jrpg to play through. I highly recommend to both old and new fans for the Xenoblade series!
4,Its 2k,Smooth nice graphics pretty fun.
1,Voucher or money grabber.,I can't redeem my voucher. The rating will remain as is. It's stupid that a simple code could cause so much distress. Next time I'm buying from the psn store or physical copy.
5,"If you have a switch, you need this.","This multiport hub is of very high quality, and it is very easy to use compared to the original one that came with the switch.  The original one is too big to place on my table, it lowered my gaming experience.  And when I was done playing with my switch I have to find a place for it which is really bothering. But with this new multiport hub, it is really easy to use you just simply plug in the power USB into the hub and connect it between your switch and monitor,  now it is time to enjoy your switch. Most importantly it is very easy to handle. Everytime after playing, my switch would be very hot if I used the original hub, but with this multiport hub, it solves my problem easily. I don't have to worry about the high temperature problems anymore. It is another way to protect your switch, so I will highly recommend this product from this seller."
1,Rushed and worse than beta,"I preodered this game with the high hopes it could surpass the already promising beta but sadly upon release, the game feels very rough around the edges. Multiplayer is horrendous with stuttering, lagging, and had to drop graphics to a lower setting or the game would crash  . Very disappointing overall, take a wait and see approach to see if DICE can get this sinking ship afloat"
2,very good game but technical glitches ruined it,I played NCAA 12 nonstop but then a week later the game froze up on me 3 times. I had no choice but return it. Thanks a lot EA for releasing a game that wasn't finished.
5,Very pleased!,"I am very happy with this headset! Our family has two xbox ones and two PlayStation4s, and we needed some headsets. I wanted good quality for a good price, and this one is great! I love how it lights up. The sound quality is good, and they are super comfortable. My 3 year old can even wear it comfortably on the smallest setting."
1,EU Version: Will Not Load US Save Files,"Took me forever to figure this out. That little orange 16 in the bottom left corner? That's Europe's rating system. Video games are often regionally locked, so do not order unless you've never played before, because it will not recognize your saved data."
4,GOOD gaming keyboard. husband loved it,i bought this for my husband after we broke his cheapo keyboard. which was also loud and would wake up my baby with the stupid clicking. this arrived in the mail and i surprised my husband with it for birthday. he has has it for 3 weeks and Loves it.. the lights look really nice. and the red lights shine great. looks really good with his gaming computer we own. ours did not come with a disc to program it either. but thats ok. the keys still make noise but are much easier to push and sound almost like a laptop keyboard. my husband no longer has to turn on a super bright lamp to see his keys at night anymore. over all i am satisfied with my purchase and if it ever brakes i will buy another one.
4,not bad.,I bought this game because it resembled a few other games i enjoy like CSI and Dracula Origin. So far it is pretty good and it runs easily. its also easy to navigate which coming from someone who doesn't know awhole lot about games is saying something.
5,This is a must have,"I owned the first Logitech Cordless Controller for the Xbox and thought I would never replace it, but think again. This controller is amazing. Not only can you walk to the other side of the room or relax while playing without cords it never misses a beat. The size is significantly smaller than the first controller making it easier to hold. Anyone who owns an Xbox must purchase this amazing product."
1,Don't trust what you read,Normally don't like to give bad reviews but this elite controller that was refurbished doesn't feel like it was actually Certified refurbished it was in good shape as in no marks but it constantly loses connection and the y button is sticking I've only had it a couple weeks.i would not buy from these people as in this is something in my opinion easily find as a problem if properly tested before it was resold as a refurbished controller.
4,Lights Require Connection,"Used for daughter's gaming (Ps4), the sound quality has not been complained about so far. Gave 4 stars because the lights only work when USB connection is plugged. This makes usage difficult by limiting your distance from console or socket. USB cord shorter than the earphone plug. This sucks because the light feature played a part in my purchase."
1,Not as advertised,I ordered 9 traps and only 8 came in the box. They were also already opened and just thrown in the box.
4,"Great tables, nice graphics, challenging but not frustrating","Sci-Fi Pinball has four tables - The Fly, Alien vs. Predator, Buffy, and Aliens.  Each table has their own personality - no two tables look the same nor play the same, usually a fault in other pins.  Graphics are top  quality, game play is smooth, tasks are challenging.  Physics of pinball  movement is good, not great.  Only complaint: tilt mechanism is the reverse  of other pins I'm used to.  Other than that, good stuff."
1,Unable to even play off disk.,I was under the impression this was a single player game (no internet connection required - as per box details). I live in a place where I simply do not have the ability to download GIANT update files. This game ships unable to play off the disk with no internet connection. I can find no way to contact the company or developers other than an FAQ on their site. I paid full price and am extreemly dissapointed.
4,Very Good - but still not the original,"My grandson just loved these. He is only 7 so was not exposed to the original Star Wars Episodes. I thought this set, even though it had been redone, was very good. I still don't understand though, why you can't get the original series as they were original done. I'm sure they could enhance the quality without adjusting some of the scenes. Why tamper with a classic? Oh well, my grandchildren still enjoyed them and that's really what matters to me the most."
1,Where Are the references to Motion Sickness?,"I honestly do not understand how there is nearly no reference to motions sickness in these reviews.  Admittedly, there are only 20-some reviews as I write this but whole video game reviewing staffs (plural) cannot review this game because the entire staff (get that...the whole staff) gets sick nearly instantly.  This is not uncommon...in fact these people who don't are the exception.  Please...at least go a few rounds with the time trial (with the open cockpit car) provided with the sample disc that comes with the vr headset.  A lot of people have no problem with this so keep in mind that this is a necessary but not sufficient test for your being able to play the full game.  But I have been made sick for hours..each time I forced myself to play for just a few minutes...on the sample disc...I won't touch the actual game which again, is supposed to be much worse for motion sickness.  But the reason I tortured myself in the first place is a that..ya, this thing is awesome--just the sample was amazing and the full disc has as complete an experience as any.  Somewhat weaker graphics?  Give me a break....it's freaking VR--kind of makes up for it."
