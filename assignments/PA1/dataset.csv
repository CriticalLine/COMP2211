1,don't waste your money,not worth a penny
1,Limited run fail,the game itself is wonderful. limited run ruined the release by pushing back multiple months. do yourself a favor and buy the digital or buy from another company and stop giving limited run business.
4,It coming,March 15 this character will be released at standard retail price in the US
5,A joy to play,"I usually suck at games like this (first time playing Guitar Hero, I swear the game was laughing at me because I was so terrible), but I have to say that I am enjoying the playthrough of this game.  I am new to the Vocaloid genre (I knew about it but only just starting listening to them), but I must say I like listening to the songs and enjoy the videos (sometimes you can forget that they are a computer program and not real people).  Now I only went through easy, and working on the normal difficulty but it does not get boring.  I hope they bring some add ons later, as well as new costumes and other things for the interactive part of the game.  If you like Hitsune or the genre in general you will enjoy this game."
5,awsome,my grandson covered his xbo and remote in the gold
1,WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!!! IT'S LIMITED TO WORK ON WINDOWS 10 ONLY!!!!! DO NOT BUY IF YOU USE 7,WHAT A COMPLETE DISAPPOINTMENT TO FIND OUT THAT ONE OF THE MOST AMAZING PRODUCTS FOR STREAMERS ALL OVER THE WORLD IS FREAKING LIMITED TO THE LAST AND MOST INTRUSIVE WINDOWS VERSION OUT THERE.. WINDOWS 10. THIS IS SO UPSETTING. I HAVE NEVER COME ACROSS TO A DAMN PERIPHERAL THAT IS LIMITED TO 1 WINDOWS VERSION. COME ON WHAT'S GOING ON ELGATO???? YOU GOING TO FORCE ME TO UPGRADE WHEN I HAVE BEEN AVOIDING WINDOWS 1O ON MY PERSONAL SYSTEM? MAKE SURE THAT AMAZON MAKE THE WARNING A BIT MORE OBVIOUS AND TELL THE WORLD THAT IT WOULD ONLY WORK ON WINDOWS 10 AND NO OTHER WINDOWS BELOW.
1,Very buggy,"Horrible game, even after the patch.  I had it crash 8 times in the first 24 hours and just gave up on it."
5,Its a good game. Most never gave it a fair chance ...,Do not listen to the haters. Its a good game. Most never gave it a fair chance they still judging on first appearance.
5,The slimmest desktop mechanical keyboard on the market,"This is the slimmest desktop mechanical keyboard on the market.  The Kailh low-profile blue switches feel different than the full size version.  They feel much tighter and smoother in my opinion.  The replacement key cap sets that you see will not fit this keyboard, but the included caps are good enough.  The switches feel crunchy and a bit loud at first.  They quiet down and smooth out once they break in a little.  The RGB lighting system is excellent.  The white color is a very clean white.  It does not have a blue or pink tint.  I love not having to lift my wrists so much.  It really reduces fatigue.  The removable USB cable is great for storage, but the socket is recessed and very tight.  Many micro USB cables will not fit the recess.  The weight is just right.  It is heavy enough to stay put without being too heavy to push out of the way.  This is a unique product, and I have not found anything else like it.  Give it a try."
5,Work great,I bought this with my controller and everything work great
5,Nostalgia!,"Functionally speaking, mine has worked perfectly. No issues. As others in the reviews have said, you need a 5v 1amp adapter to plug into the wall if you don't want to plug into the TV to power it. I tried a 2amp adapter and the system would not turn on. So, it definitely must be a 1amp. The controller cord is incredibly short. I recommend getting a set of longer ones. I wanted a second controller anyhow so that didn't matter to me. I got a set of 10ft controllers and have been fine. I like that I can save my spots for every game in the system. You can find the whole listing on NES' website. This thing is so tiny! Shows how far tech has come. All those games on this lil thing. The only downside, which isn't a downside because I thought about it before getting and made the choice is that the games on this system are built in. There are no cartridges. That means if I want more, I cannot have them. If you want games not on the listing, you then you should with a different system than the mini and be able to swap cartridges. If that is not a concern, then you're all set like me!"
2,"Horrible DRM, buy steam version instead","I preordered this game through Amazon, which does not in fact give you a steam code, but a code to use through telltale's website. Nonetheless I was excited to play it as soon as it came out, so i downloaded it off the telltale website. The authentication as soon as you start the game requires you to make and sign in with a telltale account, but there have been HUGE server issues, which leaves me with no game to play for a second day now as the game can't connect to telltale's servers to authenticate a game i preordered. Support of the telltale forums has said to just be patient, but I find it unacceptable that people on Steam have already been playing since yesterday and pirated copies have already made their way around. I'll update when the issues are fixed but for now AVOID THIS VERSION"
5,18 years in the making!!! Its finally here!!!,"Finally it took 18 or so years for ryo to get out that cave and take his much over do revenge on lan di, the man who killed his father. This game is especially more meaningful and special to all who gave in to have this game made in kickstarter. Its finally here and we deserve it!!!!"
2,Packaging sells,"The packaging for Post Mortem makes it look like an exciting, dark and mysterious game.  Its not.  Graphics for the main character are repetitive and annoying.  You can't skip the dialogue no matter how long and repetitive it is and absolutely none of the witness are the least bit interesting.  Simply didn't like it.  Save your dough."
4,something different,"I really liked this game. colorful characters and unique puzzles. the only problem I had was the lock on the wolf's house. it froze when I clicked out of the puzzle, so I had to start all over. when I got back to that puzzle I just skipped it. no other problems. it went smooth from there. good length."
1,"Parents! Read Carefully and Believe Me, You Don't Want to Buy This!","Gather round gamers and let me tell you a story. I call it ""Busted Headset and the Father with Infinite Patience"". I purchased this headset in December 2019 as a gift and by February 2020 the unit no longer charged. I contacted the manufacturer expecting a quick resolution consisting of a return and replacement. Instead, I ventured into a return process that resembled one of those hedge mazes. The replacement process began on February 29, 2020 and a replacement unit was finally received on April 7, 2020. Over the course of 22 excruciating emails, I was instructed to try different chargers, reset it with a paperclip, and send at least a dozens of photos. I had to send a copy of the invoice, but not from a mobile device! Oh no, only a screenshot from a PC using a Snip tool is acceptable! Then they decided the claim was valid and instructed me to break the headset in a very specific method (because failure to follow any instructions could invalidate the claim). Empowered by their instructions I snapped off an earpiece and cut the wires. Next, they asked for photos of the broken unit. Sadly, the photos were insufficient proof  and they decided they needed the unit and instructed me to mail it. In keeping with their increasingly bizarre instructions, we had to include a QR code. Fingers crossed, we sent it off, worried that we may have taped the box incorrectly and blown the deal. Finally, we were sent notice that a replacement unit was on the way. Now they're bugging me with requests for customer service surveys, to which I reply, if you don't know how awful it is by now, you'll never know."
5,Cant wait for the 1st dlc,Just be careful when you pick for what game you want the pass for. When you redeem the code is going to ask you for what game you want the pass for so choose the right one or you would be stuck with a expansion pass for the wrong game lol.
4,"Awesome product, cheap price!","My son loves it for gaming. You can control how bright you want it, which is convenient at night. Not to mention the keys are quiet, not like most keyboards my son has played on. Overall I'm very happy! Its a great product for an incredible price!"
1,First one did not work waiting for a replacement.,"The new console looks really nice and is slightly smaller than the origional PS4 however the one i received will not turn on. I must of received a defective one, fingers crossed for when I receive my replacement."
5,Don't read the one star reviews. Watch gameplay and make your own decision.,Don't let these ADD minded people sell you out on not buying this game. It's a great game and a great story. They're just tainted with Call of Duty Advanced Crap games. There are a lot of games out right now that are doing what The Order is. Besides... This type of gameplay for The order was rumored for quite sometime. Anyway graphics are amazing and story is great which I normally could care less about. This is more of a movie than a game but so what?? How many games have you played where there's not much of a break between shooting the same looking bad guys over and over again in a level for 15 or 20 minutes then only to see 30 seconds of a cutscene... That gets just as old. Telltales games are just like this and people don't complain about that.
2,"Beware handle stiching not very strong, its only held by a few stiches, had to return","The bag itself is ok, I had every intention of keeping until i picked it up and the handle came undone from the case to the handle, after closer inspection its held by a few threads. major fail by the design of this case. I had to return it."
4,Muy bueno por el precio,"Adquirí estos audífonos para mi PS4, mis amigos me recomendaban audífonos que no bajaban de 200USD y no tenía el presupuesto para tan gran inversión, así que decidí probar suerte y escogí este. Agradezco haber encontrado estos audífonos que son funcionales, fáciles de instalar y funcionan perfectamente para lo que necesito Warzone en PS4, se escucha muy bien y mis compañeros de juego reportan buen sonido, incluso creían que invertí en uno profesional. Son un poco grandes pero vale la pena adquirirlos si no tienes mucho presupuesto."
5,A Complete Trilogy,"I've been a fan of the AC series since the first release. I've played through AC2 and parts of Brotherhood, so when I saw this trilogy I just had to snag it. It comes with 3 Platinum Hits discs of AC2; AC Brotherhood and AC Revelations. So for anyone now getting into the series, or fans that would like the games to complete their collection, I'd definitely recommend getting this!"
1,Game forces you to subscribe to Steam.,"I have been an avid fan of the previous four Civilization games and was very shocked to find in order just to install Civ 5 I needed to subscribe to the services of Steam.  I had dealings with this company once before and found their gaming services don't always work and getting in touch with their support is next to impossible.  The game description says ""Initial installation requires one-time Internet connection for Steam authentication"" but even after authentication it required Steam to load so by ""one-time"" I guess it means once every time you try to play the game.  I'm returning the game now."
5,My son worked and saved up for this game and ...,"My son worked and saved up for this game and he loves it. Now, I just have to get him off my XBox One."
5,Great mouse for a great price,"I'm very happy with my new computer mouse (which arrived today). Not only did it arrive extremely early, it was better than expected! The mouse has a bit of weight to it which I like, so it doesn't feel chintzy like some mouses do. It feels nice in my hand and has great input latency. And for those who are wondering about the LED's, the colors fade from one to the next ranging in blue, green, pink, purple, and red (with a bit of orange). Overall a great product for a great price."
5,Awesome game!,"I wasn't sure about this game, but Nintendo help with it so I gave it a chance.  It's awesome! Definitely check it out"
5,Feeling like a bamf.,"Craftsmanshap,the material of the necklace strap,the order details with send back option and quality overall is amazing. The necklace is a bit longer than you would expect but putting a couple of knots in it to make it shorter isn't much of a hassle. Thanks Mirimax and thanks Amazon :)"
5,Read the description,"For those of you that are basing your decision for this item on the previous comment, this item states it is for your NEW ps2 and its sleek design meaning the new slim line which i have and this works!"
5,Good Investment,"If you are going to stay with a 4GB - 8 GB mem stick i'm telling you it's not worth it.. especially when you are going to DL huge files demos, videos etc. on you vita. better invest on a long term basis even if it's that expensive but if you are going to use it for a long time it's worth every penny."
2,Disappointing... Very disappointing.,"I've tried very hard to enjoy this game. I'm a huge fan on the Halo franchise. But Halo 5 is awful, I must say. It seemed that 343 tried something new here and failed miserably. No split screen, a very very short campaign and clunky controls. They also introduced a in-game purchase system to grab more of your money. Unfortunately this is debatably the worst Halo to be released. The extensively large maps are literally the only plus side to this game. Very disapointed, it's very hard to play for more than 30 minutes at a time. I apologize for the negative review for those who were excited for a new and improved Halo game."
1,Does not fit properly on Xbox one controller,I bought this to go with my new controller and it does not fit properly. I said it would fit and it doesn't really dispointed
1,"Looks awesome, Works crappy!!!",I loved the feel and look of this headset. I thought the idea was so awesome BUT when Im using it my friends say that I don't sound like me on it and they always tell me to turn my mic off cause there is too much hissing sounds and echo sounds. This happens all the time it never changes so I HIGHLY RECOMMEND not getting this headset cause your just going to run into problems.
5,Great continuation of a great series.,"Takes what made Metro a great series and improved upon it. I'm a couple hours in and so far it's excellent. Some minor control changes require getting used to but it's nothing major. The new customizing system is a welcome addition and fits well with the post-apocalyptic theme. The Amazon pre order bonus of the digital Spartan survival guide is a nice touch although I haven't looked at it yet. All in all, looks like this will be a new favorite game."
5,"something for everyone--very, very well done.","As a caregiver, I spend a lot of my time in doctors offices, hospital waiting rooms, and hospitals in general.  50 Classic Games makes the ""wait time"" go so much faster. 50 Classic Games is a ""wait time buster"" and a ""cup of tea"" relaxer.  Thank you Nintendo."
1,Really great until...,"I loved this charger immensely! It saved me money on batteries and was convenient to use. I didn't have any problems as far as communications with the Wii as the previous poster did, so it worked well for me. However, after only 2 months of usage, the charger is completely dead and won't charge anymore. It was good while it lasted, but now I'm going to be buying another brand that will hopefully last a bit longer than 2 months!"
5,So Perfect,It looks so nostalgic and that's why I got this one. Very good case. It can fit my New 3DS XL that's in the clear plastic case and 6 games. Worth the buy. A great travel case or protective case!
1,One Star,I did not finish the book because of the remorseless animal cruelty.
5,Spore PC game,"I don't understand why people don't like this game. It's fun, it's creative, and even somewhat challenging in a way. I love this game, I love how you gradually evolve, and it's just so much fun!!!!"
5,"MechCommander, GBA Style","This game is a combination of the famous computer games Mech Commander 2 and Starcraft.  it is one of the best stratagy games i have ever played.  unlike Advance Wars, this is not as power build more viehecle type of game.  this game needs strategy.  i would actually give it a 4.5 but, i don't know how.  that is because, like advance wars, you must do the dumb and annoying tutorial missions, happily, there are only seven.  the game offers a two player mode, and a difficult one.  one player will be attacking, while the other will have to stay alive for 10-15 minutes.  what you do is up to you.  you can also setup what suits you can manufacture during battle.  when you get this game, have fun."
5,The price was great,My son loves it
1,Windows Vista is poison for this game,"I got this game and was unable to run it because of Windows Vista.  The sound was choppy and full of static, although they list Vista as a supported OS.  Forget it."
5,Great Product,Sony has recently extended the deadline for the super voucher for another year until march 31st 2014 so no worries on this.
1,Looks legit,Looks legit
5,This game ROCKS!,"Santa brought this game, and I don't think we've stopped playing since!  It is such a blast, and really brings the family together.  We were all so excited when my husband finally beat platinum on ""Brick House"" (it was our last one left that wasn't platinum) the other day.  It has a great variety of songs...new and old.  Another reviewer said there weren't enough new songs, and I disagree.  My friends' daughters (21 and 16) even commented on how many new ones there were (but they still chose to sing ""Take On Me"" from the 80's.  My 8-year-old and my husband have gotten perfect scores on ""Material Girl.""  In fact, my daughter loves all the old 80's tunes.  The only problem we've had with this game is that the arrows don't show up for the dancing.  We don't have a mat, but we tried it at someone else's house.  Anyway, I'm sure we'll get that squared away by the time we get a mat.  I cannot recommend this game enough!  Don't get the headset, the regular mics are better...be sure to get two for duets!"
5,Best AC game in series..,"what are some of theses people talking about? Stop reviewing if you haven't played the game..it's a great game, everything is improved from previous ones.."
5,Absolutely breathtaking.,One of the most unique video game experiences I've ever had. This is a huge game that dares to expand the idea of what a Zelda game can be. Truly one of the best video games of the decade.
1,Broke within 6 months,Not sure if this is a common occurrence but mine broke within 6 months of use. I can still play with the controller while plugged in but it no longer charges the battery.
2,Boring For Those That Played Out Rollercoaster Tycoon 1,"If you've never played the Rollercoaster Tycoon series, than by all means, quickly buy the sequel because it's probably one of the most enjoyable games ever.  It has a simple concept behind it yet the game keeps you hooked for months.  If you love designing and creating, this IS the game for you as it's basically a layman's theme park builder.  For those that did play the first game, I have a small warning for you:  Unless you're hopelessly addicted to the first game and its many expansions, you probably won't get much out of the sequel.  It's almost a carbon copy of the first game.  Some of the rollercoaster building mechanics have changed, there are new attractions, and you can now play on maps that are realistic portrayals of the popular Six Flags theme park chain.  Other than that, everything is the same, even the graphics (which are usually the first thing to get updated in a sequel) don't look any different.  My recommendation for anyone that is the patient type and wishes to buy this game is to wait a month or two.  There are already two expansions for the sequel.  Games like these are quickly packaged into bargain combo packs and I imagine it won't be long before both expansions are available with the original game at a low price."
1,The game box has been opened when I get It ...,The  game box has been opened when I get It and there are no game card in the box. Someone taked my game card away. I am very angry now.
1,"Very, very disappointed...!!!!!","""Steam"", I hate you. I don't say much more, just: save your money!!!!!"
5,PS4 gaming headphones,Sound loud and clear
4,GOOD MOUSE,This is a great mouse for the price. Have to turn down pointer sensitivity on computer but after you do that its flawless. I would recommend this mouse
1,Buyer beware,"Unless you are one of the few people who only play against friends or strangers online this title is a major disappointment.  There is no tournament mode, custom or not.  There is no creation center.  EA has buffed up the graphics and gameplay while downgrading the options to play.  Since most fans of the FIFA series play together in groups, the fact that the PS4 engine produces a better game, it's practically worthless.  You literally have to keep score with pen and paper if you and your friends are having a tournament.  I wish I hadn't sold my PS3 and FIFA14 for that console."
1,Fun Story. Painfully Boring Combat System.,"I love mario games and have played them since I was 2, but the combat in this game is terrible. You have to constantly buy and find cards that are all 1 use and then to attack you need to select the move, paint it if you want, flick it upwards, click to use it, then time taps correctly to get the full value from the card. This long drawn out process is then repeated until the enemies die or you run out of card which sucks bad. If this game had the combat system of Super Mario RPG and the story telling of paper mario it would have been a home run. Instead the entire game revolves around dodging enemies so you don't have to fight in this terrible combat system, solving easy puzzles, item hoarding, and painting white spots to farm items. The dialog is well written and the graphics are cool. Too bad"
4,Good - But NOT a software for Dig-N-Rig unit,"We bought this software hoping, but not clear, that this would be additional software for the Tonka Dig-N-Rigs game. If you are not familiar with Dig-N-Rigs, its a GREAT game that comes with a dashboard unit that mounts on your computer keyboard. You load the software and then all of the controls are on this dashboard, like the steering wheel, crane levers, key, and horn. It is a 5-star game and my 4 year old son said, after playing for a few moments that he would be playing the rest of the day and the rest of his life. We'll, just realize that Construction 2 is not a supplement to that game and you just use your mouse. Its still a good game but not near as gratifying as Dig-N-Rigs, and I hope they eventually come out with supplemental software to that game."
5,So far a good alternative to the Genki Covert Dock,"I own a Genki Covert Dock and desired a second similar product to use as yet another switch dock to use in another room. This product is 25 dollars cheaper, so it caught my eye. These kinds of products are great for tucking an entire switch dock behind your wall-mounted tv or for travel. The Genki Covert Dock has a lot of promise of testing as to not harm your switch as other 3rd party docks can, so I was excited to see that the product page for the Hagibis GaN dock also addressed concerns with 3rd party switch docks causing systems to brick. The size of this thing is incredible, and the red and blue color scheme is very fun. The USB C cable that comes with the device is also very heavy duty. It is a nice braided cable that has a lot of body to it, so I don't imagine it will pinch or crimp without a lot of serious intent. The dock itself was true plug-and-play. I plugged the dock into a power strip, HDMI into the dock, and the USB C into my switch. The switch went dark and the image switched to the tv. I think I'll make sure there is no pressure on the USB C cable when using it as a switch dock. Taking the joycons out to allow the device to lay flat achieves this. The Genki Covert dock comes with a 90 degree low profile USB C cable to avoid this kind of concern. Maybe Hagibis will consider swapping the cable to one of a similar design in the future."
5,Instant Classic,"This game is the kind of game that you will remember playing 10 years from now. This game is belongs in the videogame hall of fame. It was extremely well done and the developers, designers, etc deserves a great deal of praise. I play this on the train to work and it makes a boring trip pass by. This is my favorite PSP game. SOCOM is a great game, but Syphon Filter makes that game seem boring by comparison."
2,Broken on 360,"I have put 3 frustrating hours into this game. Which is virtually unplayable at this point.  Difficulty with loading the game, frequent in game lock up, and major frame rate issues.  Wait for the patch and a price drop on this rehashed game. Worst of the series so far."
5,Awesome mouse,The colors and side buttons are great. Different sensitivity modes make it perfect for gaming.
1,Very Disappointing,"Freezes, glitches, very limited for a Harvest Moon game (the old Wii game was 100 times better), each day is only about 10 minutes - then you need to go back and 'sleep'. The buttons skip around making it difficult to select things. Very poorly made."
1,Cut content and poor port,"Multiplayer has been cut from Jedi Outcast. Multiple features and settings have been removed from these games compared to their PC counterparts, and performance is not that great despite these being old games. Muliplayer on the second game only has a handful of people playing and some are PC players that can always overpower you in a Saber match. Returned and didn't get a full refund. Don't buy this garbage"
1,all the hyp for nothing!!,"I am a big NBA live fan, and i tell you this is not worth your time!  I have playd LIVE since it was on supernintendo, and this game is a waste!  The graphics are crisp, but the moves are slow, the play control is in no comparison the other versions of live on the PS1.  PLEASE do not encourage the purchasing of this game!!  EA sports did a HORRIBLE job, after madden 2001 they give us this weak title....."
5,Works with Nintendo Switch on Zelda Breath of the Wild,"This product is well made, looks beautiful, and works perfectly with my Nintendo Switch playing Breath of the Wild. Just enable Amiibos in the Zelda menu, then activate the Amiibo drop zone via the Left Button (like you would for the bombs or the magnesis power)"
5,Xbox 360,Works like a original
5,The gaming system fits easily in the bag along with two controllers,"We travel a lot to see family and had been using a duffle bag for my son's Xbox.  I thought the price of this bag was reasonable and decided to give it a shot.  The gaming system fits easily in the bag along with two controllers, the cords, and some games.  It has a nice design and it isn't too bulky.  I also like that it has a handle carrier, which I think is safer than straps.  The bottom also has some reinforcement to protect it when it is set down.  I definitely recommend this case."
1,One Star,Way overpriced!
1,Collecting Dust,"I was very excited to finally recieve a Wii but then I was only disapointed when I actually played it. They almost pulled off the motion sensing controller but it just does not work very well. Games are a major problem with this system, they're hardly any games worth owning in its selection and hardly any have internet. Ours now collects dust in our living room; bottom line it is not a very good system."
4,Works like a charm!,"We have had our Kinect sensor since they first came out and have always had issues mounting the ideal position for it.  We have had it under the set, under with zoom, and above the TV.  Our makeshift mount for the above the TV worked at first as we have a Samsung 55"" Touch of Color TV that has a glass bezel frame.  Most commercial mounts didn't appear that they would fit our set.  However, when we found this model of Kinect Mount at low cost, we had nothing to lose.  We got it in a plain packaging, no instructions.  However, it was the greatest thing as it met all the needs we could've hoped for.  The photo makes it look like cheap knockoff plastic design.  It is not.  It's the sturdiest thing we've tried so far and even has locking clips to secure the sensor to it.  Repositioning is a breeze!  Try it!"
5,I'm happy with it,I think it was a great deal. All the in game bonuses made it worthwhile
2,Not for me,"I had played Mist years ago and thought this would be good fit for me. Sadly No. The game has no direction, it just dumps you into a world and lets you wander around its mazes trying to get out. Yes you do find some very cryptic clues from time to time if you can remember how to get back to the device the clue it for. You have to mapping ability not even a compass, and for me no fun."
5,Arno you didn't....,This game is incredibly awesome. There is a new pick locking technique you can use. The story to me grabs my attention alot faster than the other games in the series. And the special effects are amazing. This game is awesome.
5,Best gundam game,So much better than new gundam breaker
1,I'm sure i've played this before?.....,"This is not a new game. it's a DLC pack for Modern Warfare 2. How can this be one of the most eagerley awaited games when it's just a rehash of old. Graphics are dated to say the least, gameplay may be smooth but that does not make up the for the lazy development. Avoid."
5,Great sounds and clear,"Very good quality Gaming headset,  Adjusts to fit  your head and  is still comfortable after using for extended time periods. Made out of good Quality materials and the ears pads are great  keeps the noise out  and your gaming sounds nice and loud. It sounds great has good bass and and very clear when talking to other players and asked how I sounded and they said it was loud and clear, not muffled or any static noise in the background. Comes with instructions on how to connect it  and all the parts needed to use out of the box,  Ready to play."
1,PS4 DOA,Console came DOA...Console wouldn't insert game disc..The gears in the disc module were running in eject mode while the touch button wasn't pressed so I am unable to load the game disc into the player.
5,Very satisfied with this purchase.,"Its beautiful. Looks brand new. Didn't come in ps3 box is my only complaint. Came with a brand new hdmi cord, charging cord, power cord and a Sony brand controller. Its quiet and works perfectly. Our old one overheated, and ps3 games dont work on ps4 so the kids are going to love this."
5,Excellent accessory for the 3DS XL,"I decided to import the CPP from Japan to go with my US 3DS XL and I'm glad I did. It works perfectly with the domestic 3DS XL and really makes playing MGS3 so much better. The CPP is surprisingly light, and while it does add a lot of bulk to the already large XL it feels great in hand. I wish more games supported this accessory."
1,BUYER BE VERY AWARE... Lassie Faire,"Good luck getting any tech support from Amazon, Citizen One, or X box. The Bundle pack is a great offer, but if you need to alter your order, all parties involved are completely incompetent in helping resolve matters."
1,Overpriced and too much blur,"Blurry visuals, no real additions to the game, and way overpriced.  This should have been 30 at the most."
5,a good buyers tip,"If you are a HUGE bionicle fan or want to get this game, I would reccomend buying this game before the Bionicle: Legend of Mata-Nui PC-CD Rom game. the reason being is the PC game is the SEQUAL to the GBA game.so buy this first.a great looking game with AWSOME graphics"
5,Terrific gaming system.,"My nine-year-old loves his Nintendo switch! It was easy to set up and easy to charge and have for travel on the go! Not too bulky either! After much research, this was the one we selected. We are so glad we did because all the others are so bulky and none of them are on the go a definite must for kids!"
5,An oldie but a goodie,"This is one of the best games I ever played. It's an oldie so you need to turn your computer back to allow it to play. Unfortunately, I'm not a whiz in making my XP compatible with windows 95 so I couldn't play it. Maybe I'll find my old windows 95 computer and play it"
5,Works on DS Lite,This came packaged nicely and worked right out of the box. I was worried because of other reviews for similar chargers. This one fits and charges my Nintendo DS Lite.
5,Step up from original gold headset,"Great, sleek, lighter than the original one. Stays on my head. Does not slip an inch. Perfect sound ...plus the app companion on my PS4 makes a great touch! You can hear everything in any game. 7.1 surround sound in this headset."
5,The best RPG in years.,"The best RPG I've played in years. It's not toned down for kids, its a real deal adult RPG. The developers are amazing people, they released DLC and expansions that really enhance the game, not pointless micro transactions like other games. I have been waiting on buying the game until the Complete Edition came out. Cannot wait to dive in again."
5,So far so good,Good product much cheaper option. Hopefully the life will last.
1,DRM? No thank you.,"While I appreciate the creater's rights to protect their product, Spore's DRM is way too much. If you would like an EA sponsored virus running on your machine in the background, without the ability to uninstall without formatting-- well then Spore is the game for you. Shame on EA."
4,Not just for gaming!!,"I am not a gamer, but a 73 old man with eye sight issues---this keyboard helps with the day to day online work I find I need to do---at night it is even better for seeing all the keys and being able to work faster due to seeing better!!!"
2,Carrying strap breaks easily.,"In general, this is awesomely designed to fit my switch and all accessories. However, after a few uses (I've had it a month and half), the carrying strap started to come apart on both sides. Maybe I got unlucky with a faulty strap. I will still use it though, but I wouldn't say top-notch quality."
5,Good,Good case
5,Best Gaming Headset You Will Find At This Price Or Even ones costing mcu h more!,"I have owned many headsets from Logitech, Plantronics and my last 2 were some higher priced Racer Carachias and Kraken Pro and these put all of them to shame. First is the build quality, all top notch materials and construction which will seem to last for a very long time. Second is the comfort, these include 2 different ear cups but I use the default memory foam cups and they are the most comfortable headset I ever tried. Also included is a gorgeous box and carrying pouch. They dont squeeze your head at all and feel like a dream even after hours and hours. The Mic is detachable and is outstanding quality in both construction and sound. Last but not least is the sound quality! these bad boys use a larger than most 54mm drivers that are also unique in that they use the frequency range of 15hz - 20khz that deliver amazing sound. All the cords are long, tough and braided. Now this does come with the standard analog jack but it includes a usb control for volume and mic and is also a soundcard which allows you to activate a virtual 7.1 surround. The surround was not the best BUT if you use the Razer Synapse Virtual 7.1 surround software it becomes unreal! If I activate the razer surround and then the 7.1 button on the headphone cord I can literally pinpoint any enemy in CS:GO, it's outstanding! Every PC magazine and related websites all rate this headset as one of THE BEST you can get, even beating out headsets costing 3x more and I can see (I mean hear) why. Just go read some reviews on these badboys and see how so many praise these. These are worth way more then the crazy low price they sell these out but don't take my word. just do the research."
2,Doesn't work good.,"These just don't work well. I used them on 2 controllers and they still sucked. I love Kontrol Greek but this just sucks. Their thumbsticks work great, their grips work great but these don't. Even with the medium strength ring it is nearly impossible to aim. I had my sensitivity on max and it was like I was on 3. It did help aim though. I could bring the recoil down and I could hit the enemy with most of my shots. You don't over steer with your aim (mainly because it's hard to even aim) and its easier to get back on the enemy if the recoil takes you away. I haven't tried any other brand and at the moment I don't plan to. I hope this was helpful and I hope that you have an amazing day."
5,Lake House : Children of Silence - Collector's Edition,"I love this game.  It does have a built-in strategy guide, but it is a little different than I am use to.  So when ever I get stuck, instead of using the strategy guide, I use the hint button and that takes me where I want to be.  This is a fun game to play, alot of locations and hidden objects are easy to play.  The mini games are also fun to play.  I will certainly play this game again."
1,I am missing the amazon exclusive DLC,I only got the code for the cactaur but nothing of the Sephiroth theme or carbuncle. I waited an extra 3 days for these perks! How do I get them?
1,Another burned-out remote!,"I bought this at Target three weeks ago.  Go to use it tonight and find one of the remotes is very hot.  I remove the battery and there's a burn mark on the back!  I try regular batteries back in the remote itself and it doesn't work.  So not only did I have a possible fire hazard, it also killed the remote it was in!"
5,Protect Your Investment,"I wanted to bring my 360 to my friends houses, but was worried of the possible damage it could cause. Scratches, cracks, and malfunctioning were just a few of my worries. Intec is known for making great cases for xbox, as well as ps2, psp, gameboy, and others, so I went and tried the case. The compartment for the 360 is padded and has an extra cover over the top to seperate it from the rest of the case. Other compartments are shaped to fit 2 controllers, wires, and 6 games. To top it all off, the whole case is protected by the hard case, aluminum shell (preferable over a soft shell case). The only problem with this case is that there is no place to put the power adapter. I tried to fit it in with the controllers, the wires, even the 360 compartment, but no luck. So for now I put the adapter in a seperate bag."
1,One Star,The item was defective. It would randomly shut off during use and glitch. We returned it.
5,nintendo is the best,Nintendo is supreme. All others pale in comparison. They are shameful next to the mighty Nintendo. Definetely worth it if your in to collecting. Definetely worth it if you have kids. At 49.99 its an absolute bargain considering the long term value of an item like this. Straight into the mario collection NO QUESTIONS ASKED for me.
5,Love this controller,"I'd been having an issue with my PS2 and after a lot of trial and error, and buying a new (used) PS2 determined among other issues, none of my controllers worked (weird one wired and 2 wireless).  Anyway looked for a new controller as a trouble shooter.  This controller synced right away, works great and feels comfortable.  Will probably buy another so I don't have to share!"
5,Great keyboard that feels better than the g15,"Overall I am quite happy with this keyboard in comparison with the ""new"" g15. The keys are easier to press and light up far more brightly than the g15. Being able to change the color scheme in the gaming mode really looks awesome. One point I do not like but most would is that in gaming mode the windows key press is cut from the keyboard meaning even if you have it disabled via your registry you cannot press the windows key which I use for skype, ventrilo and teamspeak. Some may complain of the spacebar but it feels fine except it feels as if it could become a sticky press down the line but overall not a significant problem. I can also press more than 3 keys at once and all the keystrokes will register in comparison  with the eclipse 2. Great for gamers and for people who type frequently."
5,Ive had this for a month and it works perfectly would not recommend going to gamestop and paying 70 dollars when this ...,"Was having an issue of my Xbox One not powering on. When I hit the power button it would chime and then turn off. I would have to unplug all the power cables and reset the power brick anywhere from 20-50 times to get the power brick light to turn white and then turn on my xbox. I youtubed countless videos, and none of them worked. I tried taking the power brick apart cleaning it, using a different cable, sticking in the cable to the back of the power brick halfway and wiggling it to try and discharge the static, none of that worked only hoping that after enough times of resetting the brick it would turn on. Ive had this for a month and it works perfectly would not recommend going to gamestop and paying 70 dollars when this is a perfect replacement."
1,you have to be an Xbox Live Gold member to play this game.,imagine my surprise when I found out (after purchasing the game) that I would have to be a member of Xbox  live gold. I was very unhappy about that and returned it immediately.
2,Glad I rented...,"Rented this game with a friend and put some hours in over the weekend.  After trying different game modes, weapons, and vehicles, we sort of scratched our heads and both said we expected more.  I am a huge fan of Star Wars Battlefront 2 and my kids and I still play it on our PS2 to this day.  It is clear that this game seriously lacks content compared the Battlefront 2, a game that came out 10 years ago.  And although it looks and sounds beautiful, it is just not as fun as BF2 either.  I would have honestly been thrilled if they just took BF2 and remade to with better graphics and sound.  Definitely glad I rented.  2.5 Stars"
1,I am experiencing constant red horizontal lines on the display ...,"I am experiencing constant red horizontal lines on the display screen of my brand new Oculus device.  It's completely unusable. The HDMI port is working correctly. I have a Nvidia GTX 1060 with updated drivers. The HDMI cable does not appear to be damaged. I have restarted my computer and gone through the setup process several times, but the problem is the same each time.  Of course there is only a web-ticket support.  You never actually get to talk to someone.  I have checked online for people who have had similar problems and they almost all ended up having to return theirs.  Unless their support really comes through in the next few days I will be returning this."
5,Great. The only way to go is preorder on ...,Great.  The only way to go is preorder on Amazon. Pre order 3 games and u pretty much get a 4th for free
5,The game came out in 2015.  And still lives up to the hype!,"The game came out in 2015. And I remember the raves and reviews this game got! But at the time I was getting my life sorted out I just finshed college and was interning and before you knew it 6 years had past. Now, I'm working full time and with paid leave (summer vacation) and I finally have some free time. Its 2022 and i finally bought the game,  and i have to say it so much FUN and SCARY! guys if you're reading this get the game! Money worth spent."
2,Read as the same controller cant use both at the same time,"One works, when both are plugged in they both read as the same controller. Tried redoing the drivers several times I'm stumped"
1,Buggy not ready for release,"It sucks it looks nothing like it was advertised as, and has tons of bugs. Game keeps crashing too."
5,Isabelle exists to spite me,"Glad I was able to get my hand on some packs but every single special card was Isabelle, I cannot stand that money bag headed poodle, why Nintendo. I just wanted my rotund shy manatee."
1,The animal abuse stories will make you cry,I really enjoyed this book until the animal abuse stories. He wasn't the one abusing the animals but he didn't really care either. I cried and had nightmares because of this book. It should have a warning on the first page.
5,Easy to store,"Material: Material is safe and reliable. Characteristic description: It is suitable for training people's logical thinking. Finishing: Easy to store. Summary: Bought many, many, all are very good. Although the price is not cheap, but the flashing design light is really worthy and great. , The design concept is really amazing"
1,One Star,"Community is more toxic than the water in Flint, Michigan."
5,I like that I can pllug this in anywhere,"I like that I can pllug this in anywhere. I put it in a TV USB port and it worked just fine. Also charging using the bottom port seems to be more dependable than the micro usb ports, which are flimsy."
1,Sad rip off,Didn't work when I got it and I didn't no how to send it back
5,Works well!,A great little stand will fit the switch lite with a thin case. Hori rugged case will not fit. Mumba and clear case will fit
5,Great replacement joysticks thus far!,"I recommend watching a joystick replacement video on YouTube (Spawn Wave for example) to decide if you want to DIY.  About 30 minutes for me to replace both with no prior experience.  Screws and parts are small, so keep them sorted and go carefully, and you'll be fine.  I had to figure out the metal replacement lock pins on my own, but they were fairly straight forward.  There is one inside each black side strip right behind the round black release push-button on the outside of the controller, if you can't find them.  Remove one screw and pull out the silver metal u-shaped bracket to replace them.  The u-shaped bracket was tight for me, so just keep at it gently to pull it straight out from the side strip.  Calibrate your joysticks when done!  We've only been using the replacement joysticks a few days, so I can't comment on durability yet, but performing perfectly so far!"
5,Good Buy,Did what it was supposed to do at a nice price!
5,this game is far better than i expected far better,"this game is far better than i expected far better! i came from WoW and honestly i cannot see myself going back ever, it is definately a grindfest and not for everyone BUT there is always something to do if you are leveling your class as a disciple of war or magic then you can level your profession and if i remember right you can just go purely crafting though that would be more tedious and time consuming so they do mix some things up and get you out into combat BUT it can still be done! players are of a much more helpful sort than any MMO i have experienced and definately better than WoW.......all in all i am greatly overjoyed with the game and will try and steer every MMO player i come across in its direction."
2,5 hour single player campaign,"How can a game with a 5 hour single player campaign have so many bugs that force you to restart the game at a previous checkpoint?  If you prefer single player to multi-player, save your money."
1,"Awful ""customer service""","The product itself is fine. I prefer the analog stick placements on other controllers. The real reason this review is as such is because the customer service that nacon provides. The cable on the controller broke, and bent the prongs on the controller. When I e mailed customer service, because there is no phone number available, I received an e mail back saying simply they do not repair the controllers, nor do they cover it with warranty. Both of these I already knew. I was just curious where I could get parts, or what the parts were called. I received another e mail asking for my information so they could send a cable. No cable ever came in. I asked again about the parts. It has now been two weeks with no response. I will NEVER buy another product with the nacon name."
5,BEAST DECALS,"What can I say about these decals. They are exactly how they look. Very simple and easy to put and they look fantastic. I kid you not,my friends actually thought that I got am whole new controller. They blend in perfectly and will satisfy your batman needs. Also the company is very nice and needs some support trying to get its business off the ground. I hope this review was helpful"
5,Good Keyboard for the money.,"I bought this keyboard for 45 dollar which felt like a steal for a gaming keyboard by logitech and it feels that way. I also see that people say it's a big keyboard, but it's really not unless all you've ever used are dinky small keyboards at work or at school. I'm gonna be using this keyboard for work since I like gaming keyboards, but it almost feels like a waste since this could easily be my gaming keyboard at home. The only downside is detaching the keys seems to be a pain so getting a real deep clean will probably be tough, but other than that it's great."
1,Received European Version,"Received European version, not amused."
5,Don't listen to the one star reviewers,"I've played and beat it on the Xbox one when it first came out a year ago and I must say I'm going to be selling that copy cause it is 10 times better on the PS4. in my opinion it runs smoother (no glitchy twitchy cutscenes), loads quicker and looks better. The bonus content is fun and interesting the art book is nice and having access to all dlc is always a plus."
5,Very well made.,"Let's see if Big Brother deletes this review the way they did the my first one. This unit is the only one I trust. Well made, and accurate. This is my seond unit from them, and I have no complaints. Well done."
1,DO not buy!,DO bot buy!
5,perfect to throw in a small carrying case instead of ...,"Works, perfect to throw in a small carrying case instead of trying to carry around all the game boxes. Keeps everything organized, a must for people who will be owning a lot of games."
1,Disappointed by how easy it is!,"I have had the game for 2 days and I am almost finished with it, it has been pretty easy you are pretty much on a team and you end up babysitting them the whole time, it is really frustrating. The only thing I like about it is the graphics. I hate that I can't play split screen with my husband, I loved being able to play with him. I hope they change back to the way it was before.  :("
1,Uhhhhhh,It did not have the plastic covering and was a bit sketched out when I saw it wasn't there hoped the game was still there at least but no when I opened the box the game cartridge was missing
5,Más de lo que esperaba por el precio,"Muy bueno, es compatible con Mac, no cansa la muñeca, tiene luces de colores y apagado automático, muy bueno para su precio."
4,Yay,I'm soo happy xbox came out with this before Christmas cuz my boys wanted the ps5 or new Xbox and I tried soo hard to get it for them but it was impossible and I wasn't paying double triple the price for it just crazy soo the kids seeing a fornite xbox 300 worked for them and ho ho
5,This cable works well,"I intended to purchase an Wii HDMI converter but I was seeing mixed reviews on these adapters, Some reviews were mentioning that the adapters where getting hot to the touch, breaking into pieces, and not operating after a few uses. The only ones that were reliable were no longer available to purchase. I searched some more online and youtube and found a video for this cable. Even though I would like to have full 1080P resolution on my Sharp LCD television, this cable converts the 480P resolution on the Wii to something watchable. I am able to stream Netflix  and Hulu on this tv and  the clarity is pretty close to standard definition channels from Directv. I recommend this product to anyone on the fence about the Wii to HDMI converters."
5,Five Stars,fits the controller nicely!
5,Very good budget mouse,"This mouse is light, smooth, satisfying, and the colors look really nice. The only issue I have is that the sensor is not very sensitive when I am gaming."
4,Good for early gamers,"My daughter is 7, and is just getting into Gameboy games.  This is one of her favorites.  I can certainly see where it would get old fast for more experienced gamers, but for beginners it provides enough direction and progress to keep them going."
5,Works great,Worked as described.
1,"Shame on you EA, for a game that is impossible to install on the PC!","EA should be ashamed of themselves!  My daughter was so psyched to play Sims4, and was utterly dissapointed when I could not get this game installed on our PC, even after almost an hour of trying!  In all my 56 years, I have never come across any PC install that is as complicated and convoluted as this one!  To complicate things further, 2 discs come in the box.  The installer should literally walk you through how to install this game step by step!  What a waste of money, and time!"
5,Great system,"I bought this console to play the Breath of the Wild, and so far I think that I've been missing out. Mine works perfectly, no glitches or scratches. Really should have bought one sooner."
5,Works Perfectly Fine,"I was skeptical about purchasing this with many the negative reviews...but for the low price, I couldn't resist. I purchased this to play the Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword. It works perfectly with my Wii controller. (Just a few notes, my Wii controller was purchased along with the Wii system when it was first released...I'm not sure if there are any differences with the newer models, but maybe that has something to do with it? Or maybe it's just luck...I don't know.) Anyway. The Motion Adapter makes the game experience slightly more interesting (and tiring, lol) since the character actually follows your motions...so, it's fun. I'm just really glad it works well for me."
5,Great Gaming Experience,"Great, don't believe all these fake one star trolls...trying to make themselves feel better by making an error of judgement and going for the ps4"
1,Use caution with any product from this vendor!,"If you have not read the other reviews for Handango products, do so before you buy, as I wish I did. They have an iron clad return policy for defective or deceptive software, which they will be happy to share with you after you buy, and that is you bought it, you own it. There is no person to talk to on the phone when you try to reason with the company, and many of these products are nothing more than advertising for the web site based software. Not reccomended"
1,Gen Premium Dual Charging Station,ATTN:  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.....This station does not work at all...I have pushed and shoved the remotes into the bay and they go red for about 10 seconds then stright to blue....WILL NOT CHARGE....I knew this item was to good to be true...I should have read more of the reviews but I thought Amazon stood by what the sellers had to offer...MY BAD...Thanks to the seller and Amazon...Why if there are so many bad reviews would Amazon continue to allow this to be sold???
5,Real Time Tribe,"This is a cute, family friendly game.  You start off with a handful of characters that all wash up on shore on the island you select.  You can set priorities for individual tribe members, such as gathering food, construction, or science.  You can also designate building to be constructed.  Creating new characters is accomplished by clicking one tribe member onto an adult tribe member of the opposite sex, and then you have a small infant running around the island.  Each character has his or her own strengths.  This is a casual, fun game.  Since the game is in real time, your people will age and continue to work, even you are not playing the game.  If you enjoy Tycoon games, you will probably like this game as well."
5,No Substitutions,"I couldn't find these in the stores anywhere, so I settled for a Komodo brand.  It specifically says for Xbox 360.  The quick charger wouldn't recognize them, and neither would the play and charge.  They are only a buck cheaper than on here, but what good are they if you can't even charge them!!!  I won't make that mistake again.  I'm going strictly for Microsoft branded gear.  I'm so glad I found these here on Amazon!  Don't settle for goofy knock-off brands for replacements!  Amazon is the best mall ever!!!"
1,Huge price mark up,Don't buy any of them with the words Nintendo switch on them. They are marked up just to take advantage of those who don't know that any SD card will work.
1,Skip the Microsoft Store Mini-Game,"After several attempts, I was still unable to download this product from the Microsoft Store. While I could not reach someone to help me with my purchase at Microsoft, within two minutes I was being helped in the middle of the night by an Amazon customer service representative. If you are unfamiliar with how the Microsoft Store works, take a moment to consider purchasing this game at a later date when it will be available thru different vendors."
5,It works with MAME for Mac OS PPC and Intel.,"I really like this controller.  We bought two of these for the kids.  They work plug and play under Windows 8, Windows 7, and Mac OS X (we tried MAME games).  In Windows we played FIFA 2012, we played Need for Speed, and Call of Duty 4. The cable is long, so we had no problem sitting in the couch in the living room.  The six-button on the top design is immaculate, so far it is the only such one design we could find!  Street Fighter in MAME was a total blast.  Pac-man, Pac-Land, Wonder Boy in Monster Land, Space Invaders, Tehkan Soccer, Bubble Bobble, Shinobi, Rygar, Altered Beast, Pole Position, they all came back to life in perfect shape even in 2013!"
5,very smooth action and looks the part!,Great keyboard for gaming. I got this for my child to up her gaming skills when she is allowed to play. Its fun and gives a cool vibe to the whole setup. works great and is comfortable. Also you want to be wired directly in for those FPS games.
5,Must have for any smash bros fanatic!,This controller goes perfect with the smash bros switch edition! The smash ball logo on the controller actually has a shiny matte finish to it. Recommend for any smash bros fan
5,Great deal.,Got this to go in an old PS2.  Works like a champ.
5,Take it from the stadium champ,I was the East vs. West pokemon champion march 5 2000 in wood bridge New Jersey. I'm a pokemon pro and i feel that this game if good for all ages. It has a rough pokemon satdium and it also has the long awaited stadium gs which allows you to compete with the brand new pokemon.All in all u can battle with 249 pokemon ( even though there are 251 so most likely they are hidden characters) If you own pokemon stadium there  is no need to by a transfer pack but if you don't i suggest bying one because it is the only way u can use the pokemon you train your self. Good Luck to all new and old trainers alike.
5,Five Stars,Grandson was more exicited about these then the computer his parents computer they got him. Works for me!
2,Smells like it came from a smokers house.,"WhIle works as expected and came with everything I needed, it smells like whoever had it last was a heavy smoker. I didn't know it was possible for plastic to retain such a smell."
5,Do not buy this unless you plan on not seeing ...,"Do not buy this unless you plan on not seeing your child except for meals. I got this for my 17 year old son and have ended up with multiple boys in my house having a blast with this thing, and of course, even playing by himself."
5,Identical to original,Identical to the original Adapter that came with my Wii U. It is nice to have a second adapter just in case you plan to move the Wii U from room to room and not having to worry about bringing the Adapter with you.
5,Perfect,Sturdy and fits in the elastic compartment of the included Steam Deck case.
5,So Convenient!,With two little boys that love their games The charger and it's design are terrific.. I love how it is space saving and able to be contained in the same space!  Keeps the charged and ready to go! So efficient and handy.
5,Amazing,Yep
1,Quite honestly shameful.,"Honestly, its shameful that scalpers would go this far just to sell a 50 dollar controller for 5 times the amount. Who else agrees with this."
4,Ty the Tasmanian Tiger - A GREAT GAME!,"I loved this game. The graphics were beautiful. Both my 3 year old son and his dad, who normally enjoys games like Mech Assault got into this game. Ever since we purchased this game, I've been looking for something comparable, but nothing comes close. I can't wait for Ty II. The bottom line, you can't go wrong with this game. It's fun, and very entertaining. Easy for little ones to play, and fun for adults as well."
5,Great Book for all truth seekers,this book is amazing and actually really well written and thought out...it can possibly be read by men well...I can't put it down
5,Five Stars,It fit my pro controller
1,Appropriately titled.,"You play an asset flipping game company who takes criticism very poorly, and instead of trying to improve the product you decide to sue everyone involved. The kickstarter minigame is fairly fun, though the quest to find a lawyer was very boring, and the game is apparently glitched in that you can only ever fail that particular quest. One star out of five."
5,Vocabulary and Spelling -- a great learning tool for kids and adults,"My Word Coach DS (we liked the Wii version so much that we also bought the DS game - the DS stylus makes it easier to write, but my son likes the Wii's fun factor, and the Wii remote seems to keep him more involved in the learning process) - Do you have a kid who hasn't read enough to build a large vocabulary and strong spelling skills OR a kid who finds words fascinating? This game works for both, and provides lots of word practice with a series of different games -- my kid seemed almost surprised at the end of his first series that he had learned so much. There's lots of reading (definitions, etc.) which I think would make it tricky for kids much younger than ten. The game has progress graphs and high score history for encouragement and provides a word review after play. There are vocabulary games (e.g. Split Decision where you match the word on the screen to its correct definition) and spelling games (what could be more fun than grafitti-style spray painting to fill in the missing letter or correct a wrong letter?), with six training games in all and a couple of 'recreational' DS games. There are lots of options to keep a player's interst as the game gets harder -- for instance, both definitions may be wrong in Split Decision. My soon-to-be eleven year old plays until the professor tells him to stop for the day (after he's mastered a profile-determined word list). There's a slight learning curve, but he figured it out on his own without getting frustrated. He intuitively began picking up on clues such as how to guess a word from the definition. My son says it's ""lots of fun -- almost, but not quite, like a regular game."" I predict libraries and after-school programs will be holding lots of competitions with this game."
1,Phony bologna!,"Just overpriced IPA and a sponge in cute packing.  Not very effective.  For 7 bucks I got 32 Oz IPA, a bottle of brasso and a box of qtips.  I added pictures.  The 1 up did nothing.  The brasso and IPA for cleanup renewed the NES contact pins to shinny.  Good gimick though.  Only good for surface dust and why get this when rubbing alcohol, which this uses, is cheaper to buy at any store."
4,"Amazing id Software game, but covered in Bethesda garbage","Amazing id Software game, but covered in Bethesda garbage.  As soon as you start the game, it forces you to log into Bethesda.net.  Why does id Software even need a publisher in 2020?  You can publish anything you want on the internet and instantly reach billions of people."
5,Nintendo Ethernet Cable Adapter,Works as advertised. Plug and play. No drivers needed as they are already preinstalled on the Nintendo Switch. The wireless icon on the Switch will change to a wired icon when you have installed it correctly. This accessory is a must if you plan to play online multiplayer games.
4,Logitech steering wheel,I stopped buying Logitech products a few years ago. Their gaming keyboards were crap. But I took a chance on this wheel and I have to say I'm quite happy with it. Maybe Logitech step their game up. I use it for Euro Truck Simulator and it works great!
5,Compatible.,"I have the old school NES system, and I was looking to add a second controller.  The two pack is a great value, although you'll first have to come to terms with your wife being Player 2.  Although not a true ""Nintendo"" product, the aftermarket assembly on this generic brand is reliable (tested on Punch Out - works as it should).  My biggest concern was compatibility... and yes, it is compatible with original 1980's NES."
1,I have not been able to play at all since ...,"I have not been able to play at all since launch.  I have had 4-8 hours sitting in a queue because Blizzard does not have the capacity to support it's players.  One day, I finally got to about 2 hours away from being able to log in and then I got disconnected from the server!  I am so frustrated."
5,Love this!..Still!!......And Still in May 2020,"Works great!  I have it setup on external power (had one laying around).  Fits both controllers well.  Not a 'drop' and go connection, but I like it because I KNOW it's plugged when I get it on (which isn't hard at all!!).  Similar to my PS3 controller charger been using for years! Low light on the front which is great!  Only had for a few days BUT seems like it should last as long as my ps3 charger (which I am still using!)......update May 2020.... Noticed front spot wasn't charging....took a minute...but just un-plugged and re-plugged and started to work again! Don't give up on this Gem! No I don't work for them and I paid for it myself. I believe in giving credit when due!"
5,"good game,very solid gameplay","This is a very good solid strategy game, and I am impressed. This game reminds me of Stronghold Crusader. These two games are the best strategy games on the market today, trust me. You don't have to play these games online to enjoy them. The realism in the game is amazing,along with the graphics, and you don't need an Area 51 computer for the game to run smooth, that in itself is a great triumph, for the makers of this game, and I salute you. The zoom feature is just right which is the L Key, Plus you can hit the enter key,,,,type...view all to reveal the map, You can type in a few more phrases,if you want to.This will probably be the only true american revolutionary game you will ever get your hands on, Go buy this game,I know a good game when I play it. One of the reviewer, said the soldiers can only fight, I beg the differ, they can shoot some of the wildlife, for food,then take it to the storehouse. I would like to clarify one of the reviewer,statement,saying the soldiers move too fast,, well let me say, there is a slider button on the option menu,so you can slow the movements of the troops, and every thing else."
1,Not compatible with my wii charger,These do not have the metal strips that align with the charging tips of my wii. They come with a wall plug charger but you cannot tell when they're charged! The light never comes on and never goes off ... for WEEKS! Plus the charge seems to only last about an hour. I'm not impressed. In fact I'm pissed off.
5,Top Quality Headphones,"I love these! For the price they are so comfortable, and the sound is top quality. You can hear enemies creeping around corners behind you, and music sounds crystal clear. Definitely a good, sound, purchase. No pun intended. :)"
2,it doesn't work consistently,"i really like that the mouse is quiet and when working it moves around fluidly without choppiness. i really like how bright and pretty both the mouse and the keyboard are, the keyboard being a perfect backlighting for playing in the dark, which i do a lot . the problem i have with this mouse and keyboard are that they work inconsistently. in the middle of using them, not even during a pause, they will stop working, which can be detrimental for gaming obviously. that is what they are intended for and why i bought them. it will take a bit of prodding for them to come back on when this happens. it's not like they are shutting down to save power during non-use, it is in the middle of using them. i have spent a bit of time with customer service, which btw are very nice and professional every time i have needed them, troubleshooting and trying to solve the problem. eventually i had to have them exchanged, to no avail. the new mouse and keyboard did the exact same thing over and over again. to me, this indicates there is a problem with this product in the manufacturing . i don't recommend purchasing this item. they say ""you get what you pay for"" but even at this price, i paid for more than a few hours of continuous play time. it's very unfortunate."
4,A fun game with realistic play.,"I find this game to be pretty fun with rather realistic play. There are a variety of lures to buy and choose from with tips on how to use them and what you can catch with them. Hardcore fisherman might even get a big kick out of the fact that you can even choose different rods, reels, and lines. I love that fact that you can actually choose what music to listen to on the boat's radio. You can cast any way you want to with different ways to reel in different lures. Setting the hook takes a flick of the wrist just like in real life and you have to watch the tension and drag. There are quite a few lakes to unlock and the environments are expansive. While the actual fish look pretty realistic, the graphics elsewhere might seem sub-par. The water looks poor, the underwater scenes are dark, and the underwater terrain and vegetation are HEAVILY pixelated. Although the graphics could have been better, even for Wii, I feel the flexibility and realism of play make up for it. The fishing rod peripheral included feels solid, however, when casting, I would keep both hands on the remote and nunchuck so that the weight of the nunchuck doesn't break the reel, which feels like the weakest point. If you do that, which isn't really awkward or uncomfortable to do, the rod should last a long time I think. The game, however, probably isn't really too difficult to play without the rod. I really like how the rod can be adjusted for left or right hand use, even though I'm just right handed."
5,Everything I could have asked for on my Quest 2!,"I've been debating getting an elite strap for my quest 2 since I bought it. It seemed expensive and I still would have to also buy the oculus brand battery or deal with attaching my 3rd party power pack. I usually kept my power pack in my pocket, or sometimes attached to the fabric stock strap with rubber bands. This new head strap checks every box I could have asked for. It's very comfortable and easy to adjust. Huge difference having weight on the back to balance the headset. Having a spot to attach my own battery, and even easily swap them out, is a game changer! Product feels very well made and came in very nice hard packaging. For the price you can't beat it."
5,it works as expecited,it has 3 buttons on the side some cool LED and a SEXY click feel still have no clue how to change dpi or light color but dam it feels nice the scroll while is a liltle loose other then that it's a great Mouse
5,The packaging of the keyboard was very nice. The keyboard is bit heavier than others,The packaging of the keyboard was very nice. The keyboard is bit heavier than others. The keys feel nice on your fingers. You could type on this keyboard very comfortably. It switches between three colors and the brightness can go from off to dim to bright. Overall this keyboard is very nice.
1,No bump in the night,Pre ordered the game and I never got the pre order bonus
1,DO NOT BUY!,Do not buy this game! I love the mass effect franchise and couldn't wait to play this game. The game is incredible buggy and now after almost 24 hours in the game will just crash and i can no longer finish it. EA and bioware put out a unfinished game.
5,great workout,"I have had the wii fit since it came out. LOVED IT! However, I am starting to get bored. One can only hoola hoop so many times. I was on the fence about wether to get this game or the outdoor challange. Since this one used the balance board, I chose it. I dont really care about graphics, they are not going to help me lose weight. I did however start sweating after 5 minutes and was ready for more. I think this is a much harder workout and a nice step up from the wii fit. I would agree that the response time is alittle slow, however i think that just makes you work harder. isnt that the point anyway!"
5,Instant Classic,"Feels like a modern game, upgrades to visuals and controls are well done, still one of the best games to ever come out. Runs super smooth docked and in handheld mode, truly amazing that there are no FPS drops anywhere. Like Zelda, it's not super hard combat; more about exploration and simple environment puzzle solving. And backtracking, lots and lots of backtracking."
2,Only 22 Slots for Cartridges,"The case only has 22 slots for games, not 24 as advertised. Seems to be made well enough, but I don't need the SD card storage and I DO need 24 slots for the cartridges. Not worth returning, but annoyed nonetheless."
1,NO AC ADAPTER??!,First it was the game that came with the system. Then they took the player two controller. And now they don't even include a power source? What has happened to this beloved brand? I grew up with Nintendo. What should have been nostalgia was overrided by anger. This is not the same Nintendo I used to know.
5,A Grand Zelda Adventure,"Fear not, Zelda loyalists, this new GBC adventure, even though developed by Capcom, lives up to the Zelda name in every way possible.  Even surpassing Link's Awakening in the gameplay department, this game is a treat for Zelda purists and newcomers alike. There is great variety in Link's adventure this time around - you'll find yourself doing everything from riding mine carts to hopping, swimming, and flying around with your newfound animal buds.  These animals are a great additon to the game: You'll meet all three on your quest, but you get one to ""keep"" as your pet. The main item here is the mystical rod of seasons.  Adding great depth to the game, you'll gain the power to change the weather and landscape at will with the help of a nearby tree stump.  The other items, found in dungeons and other places, are definetly the most amazing and innovative items seen yet in a Zelda game, including it's parter pak, Oracle of Ages.  I won't list any of them here, but later in the game you yourself will be astounded. If the new 3D incarnations of the series are too easy for you, be prepared to meet your match.  The action in this game is great, sometimes overwhelming, as the many enemies and huge, tough, bosses will certainly leave you gasping for a breather.  Don't delay, even if those flashy Game Boy Advance games have caught your eye.  You won't be seeing anything this good on a handheld system in a long time.  And, even though its marketing scheme, don't pass up on Ages either.  The two games Link together once you've completed one of them, adding more items, dungeons, and bosses into the mix.  Get one, and if you're thirsting for an especially big adventure, get both.  You won't regret it, and besides, its ZELDA.  Do I really need to tell you this?"
4,A great entry level football game,"I would recommend this game for anyone out there who is looking for an entry level football and is looking for something they can sut down and play with their whole family. Controls are easy and intuitive, the mascots are cool, and the gameplay is simple and fun. This is a great Wii game for kids that are in to football."
5,The best,Had alittle trouble putting it on but I love how it secure it is. Love that it brings 3 different covers for the joycon.
5,Who knew pollinating plants would be so fun?,"First and foremost I consider myself to be a ''hardcore'' gamer who likes to play Gears, Halo, COD etc... Eventually I became fatigued by all the shooting games and bought this just to see what it was like. This game plays like Little Big Planet as you travel through different stages pollinating plants and wildlife and figuring out simple to medium puzzles. The music within the game is relaxing and the character designs are cute. Every time you finish a level you unlock a costume for your own character which gives you a sense of personality that I feel add to the depth of this game. The UnderGarden is a game you should definitely check out if you don't have a PS3 with LBP - it's fun, relaxing and has great music, great level designs (I love the artwork that they put into it) and great character designs. The UnderGarden is a casual game that all casual games should strive to be - fun and enjoyable."
5,The Void has been filled.,"Since Bioware doesnt make great RPGs, this fills the void.  10 Hours in and loving it, although some bugs are apparent.  Im sure they will be patched in time.  Congrats to Spiders to turning it around and making something special."
4,Works,Got as a gift with a controller shell they loved it.
5,"Yes, you can use this for the DLC happening right now.","Timecards are convenient and an easy way to keep track of things, but I'm writing a review for a limited-time issue people are having. Yes, you can buy this for the DLC event that ends May 8th, 2017. It takes two days for them to send the codes, and if in that time it does not go through, an associate can be called or you can open up a ticket in chat with customer service to get your item codes for Mog Station."
4,First Impressions.,"I am about four hours into the gameplay. Right now I am pretty happy. I definitely need to play more to get the full picture but the environments are gorgeous and the few new features are just what IV needed. I absolutely love Shay, probably my favorite Templar, but that's not saying much. If you are stuck with a 360 or ps4 like I am, and you enjoyed Black Flag, you have no reason not to buy this game."
5,Wonderful game!!,"Beautiful graphics, well told story, and nice background music. I love this game. It is really entertaining. The story goes day by day, they offer a lot of activities, and you just will not get bored. So far, I can do the story without the online mode. That is nice!! I like how you can create a virtual character, features, and name them too! You can talk to everyone you walk up to. One thing I noticed was, it is hard to remember what you are told to do for the day. So; I hope they either have a journal to remember(in the game), or I will have to buy a guide book. I get kind of lost, so much to remember. But, I love the game overall. I highly recommend!! I still give it five stars for the most entertaining game ever!!"
1,Huge Disappointment.,"I'm sure by now you've seen all the other reviews. In short, if you're a big fan of Gears, multiplayer wise, don't buy this game. New mechanics are terrible. If you are a big Horde fan, this game removed it. The Devs at Epic have no interest in appealing to the majority of its fans. Speak with your wallet and don't buy this game."
5,great game,"I enjoy this game very much. Get alot for your money. You have to like puzzle type games though. Lots of levels,has kept me busy for some time and I am still not finished with it."
4,as good as the original,I bought this product to replace the original after my cat chewed through it. works just as well as the original and arrived quickly.
1,One Star,Capcom ruined it
5,Boyfriend Loves them!,I got these at retail price (79.99) and my boyfriend loved the design being a legend of zelda fan. He could not stop smiling and wanted to use them right away! Highly recommend as a gift for any LoZ fanatic that has a nintendo switch
1,"Not new, not sony",Did not connect to PS4 and looked used.
5,great old school dungeons and dragons rpg!!!!!,"The game is an old dungeon and dragons game, that has been enhanced some. It works great. No glitches, slow screens, black screens, missing audio or video files, patches are available if needed. I didnt need any patches or updates. I do wish that it would of stated it was a steam download. It would of been nice to have a warning. I had to set up a free steam account and download their stuff to get it. It wasnt hard just time consuming. There are an amazing amount of variety in the type of characters in your party. I mean many many not just the regular fighter, mage, cleric and rogue stuff. The world is vast and interesting, the quests are numerous and some are a bit confusing, i doubt you will get it perfect the first time. The game has super replayablity. Your thief can pick pocket people which is nice!! You will need to pause each round of battle to give out the battle commands to the whole party. It is very much like dungeons and dragons second edition game rules. Leveling, learning and memorizing spells. Its as great game and well worth the money. The graphics are good, a bit dark but good, very well done game!!!!"
4,Pretty good,"Headphones sound fine, my son says they are comfortable to wear, and the mic sounds good to the people he talks to. However, I wasn't aware when I ordered these that there are separate plugs for the mic and headphones. His PC only has one audio jack, so after they arrived I had to order an adapter. So just be aware of that when you order. The product description really should mention that. Also, the USB port on his computer is on the opposite side from the audio jack, so he can't plug them in to get the LED lights to light up. Minor thing, but if the lights are important to you, just be aware of that also."
5,One of the best VNs ever gets a great remake with extras....,"This game does an excellent job of living up to its Elite title, rewarding fans of the original game and anime, as well as providing a great experience for newcomers.  What distinguishes this version of the game is that unlike the original game(which had a very unique art style, but used stills) and most of the VNs on the market, this game uses animation assets from the anime to add some immersion and flair that keeps the player's attention.  This includes new animation built for character routes that weren't detailed on the anime.  The Switch package includes a short 8-Bit side story game, which is cute with good art and a good 8 bit soundtrack but is short and not very deep.  The PS4 version has the better extra package imo, with a full-fledged side story VN that takes 10-20 hours to finish.  However, the portability of the Switch makes it much more convenient and it truly feels like an interactive novel playing around going through the game.  So if the extras are the determining factor, get the PS4 version.  If the main game is, get it on Switch.  Highly recommended."
5,This is classy,"This is great value!!! yes the 360 has more harddrive, but you can add any sat 2.5 to the ps3. But above of that, this is a really great piece if hardware and functions. that i know you know about. But the games, are amazing!!!! it trully has the best lineup, but most importante the more original and best quality. An I am really amazed on whats coming, from Killzone 3, the Move, resistance 3, Little big planet 2.. wow..... if this continues its going to set a new standard in quality games maybe someday even better than the ps2. Yes it was hard to follow the 360 and the hot selling wii, but eventually Sonys got it... Something that needs hard work, yes it is expensive to develop, but that also provoques that the quality is very much achieved.. Cant wait for Gran Turismo 5. Give it a try , i am sure you wont regret, and also people will be jelaous.... believe me..."
5,Great Game!,I just played the game and it is so much fun!!! It's interesting to see the different animals and to do all of the things to help. THe illnesses vary greatly from toothache where you do an actual extraction to zapping viruses with lasers.  It does get more difficult as you go further and you also can get extra money and things for the zoo.  You get new animals for the zoo as you care for the animals. I'm 31 and originally bought the game for my 6 yr old. WE both enjoyed it!!!!
2,Used! Smells Like Vomit Complete with Chunks!,"We opened the box and it literally smells like vomit! The controller has food or vomit or some other foreign substance stuck between the buttons and around the entire screen. I think I may be sick. This was advertised as new and sold by Nintendo. NOT WHAT WE RECEIVED! Item arrived a day earlier than expected, and why giving two stars."
5,Value for money,"Because I bought the last handle too hastily and used it for a few days, it broke down. Because I was in a hurry, I was ready to buy another handle. I saw this handle at a glance because it was very similar to the one I used when I was a child. I was very satisfied that it could be connected to my equipment after it arrived"
5,Great cable,I got this cable just because it is able to connect to multiple consoles. You cannot however connect to all consoles at once only one at a time.
5,Excellent Teaching Tool!,"I cannot recommend this game enough!  My eight year old homeschooled daughter loves this game.  After getting frustrated with the difficulty in getting her to remember her times tables, I purchased this game to try to help.  She has gone from not wanting to even try the 7's to getting all 10 questions correct in 30 seconds.  She gets excited when she beats her previous time and tries to beat it.  If your child gets motivated by trying to beat their score, this is the game for them.  They don't have to compete against anyone else, it's just working on beating their own score.  There are several different names that can be entered and their scores are independent of each other.  There are different levels for addition and subtraction so even adults can tune up their skills."
5,Perfect for the New 3DS XL,I was concerned when I read other negative reviews but I was relieved once I received this product. It does exactly what it's intended to do. It protects the New 3DS while still allowing you to actually see it. This is great if you have a custom or limited edition version. I have no problems with it staying on. I don't feel it adds much bulk to it and it actually feels better. I highly recommend this. Well worth the wait.
5,Good Inexpensive Keyboard,"This is a good inexpensive keyboard for casual gaming and computer use. The keyboard and mouse are lightweight and look very nice. The keystrokes aren't very loud, and the keyboard can be color customized fairly easily. However, I do not think it's possible to control the mouse colors. I have only seen it on a RGB rotation and can't see any other way to change the mouse color. All in all it's a good inexpensive keyboard to use. I probably wouldn't recommend it for any pro-gaming purposes though."
1,Does not work,"I bought this game for my son as a birthday present. The board did not calibrate, we really did try everything. We even took furniture out of the play room to give it more than the 4 feet of distance per sensor. Nothing worked, my son was very sad as he was looking forward to playing the game. I will send it back tomorrow and get him something else. Very disapointing."
5,Great dungeon crawl game,"Great dungeon crawl game, it is the closest board game to classic table top rpg. It has so many expansions-contents that you will never get bored of this game. Wish it had more solo expansions or different game modes. Hero and monster miniatures are awesome."
1,Requires Internet,I'm tired of getting PC games that require Internet connection to play. I'm in the middle of Afganistan and dont have access to commercial internet.  I cant hook up a personal computer to the network so all these games that require internet connection to play are a waste of money for me.  I'm sure you wont have to register this game online if bought for a concel so why is it this way for PC.
5,Amazing!,Best gaming headset I have ever owned.
5,Fun Game,"This game is not only challenging and fun, but it is hilarious!  The chuzzles have their own personality.  If you take too long with your turn, one of the creatures will fall asleep.  Sometimes they wear sunglasses.  If you get a giant chuzzle and left click about 5x, it will blow up its cheeks and if you keep clicking it will burp really loud.  If you left click on the regular chuzzle at least 6 or so times, it will sneeze, and if you continue clicking it will sneeze so hard it blows of all of its hair.  If you left click and hold and move the entire row of cuzzles back and forth 5 or 6 times really fast, then release, the eyes of all the chuzzles in the row will roll around and they make funny noises.  If you don't know where to move but don't want to lose points on a hint, then just sit there for 30 secs....the one who rolls his eyes is the one you need to move, so watch the board carefully.  Sometimes it doesn't want to give you the clue, so it will frown and make a mean noise.  I'm sure there're more funny things that I will continue to discover about this fun game."
1,Pay to win,virtually the same thing with evolve DLC practices
5,Patience is a virtue.,Excellent! I patiently waited until he was in stock and placed an order as soon as Link went live. No problems at all.
1,DO NOT BUY,"I bought this card and started buying a few things in Gta online. After only 20 minutes, I was automatically banned from gta online for a month. I want a refund, and I WILL get one. Their automatic banning system is so flawed that it can't determine who is a legit player, and who is cheating. STAY AWAY from shark cards. STAY AWAY from rockstar, because their support system is GARBAGE."
1,Not what it appears,"My mother who is an over weight diabetic bought this game and I did it with her over the weekend.  But what we discovered was that things are as they appear.  What do I mean, well we picked the option to enable the balance board with the game.  But as my mom got tired and sat down, the game kept going, kept giving her calorie burns and kept counting as if she were still doing the game even though she wasn't doing anything not even moving the remote. So if you play it as if you were watching a DVD it is a really good work out but doing it and thinking that it is acknowledging your moves is another.  Also once you start a session you can not stop without loosing all of the work you have done.  And even the easiest work out is a lot for someone who is really over weight.  There were somethings I couldn't even do and I am 36 yrs old and 35lbs over weight, and hike on the weekends.  So my mother had a really hard time with it."
5,One of my favorite games!,"This game is AWESOME! Has farming, relationship building, fishing, animal befriending, mining and even some cave fighting! Fantastic game, one of my all time favorites."
5,Works good,Works great
5,Cryostasis- interesting morality tale,"Cryostasis is a first person game that sort of defies description. Some may call it a FPS, others an adventure game. I believe it melds these two concepts together, and does them well.  You play a Russian scientist at the North Pole who is sent to investigate an ice breaking ship that has run aground and become incased in ice.  The big hook of this game is the 'Mental Echo' ability that allows you to re-live the last moments of dead crew members and try to correct things that they did wrong before they died.  This is a very unique premise, and I rather enjoyed it.  There is a lot of trial and error with the Mental Echo ability, but it is pretty painless as you can retry as often as you like (with no loading or game over penalties!)  Some people have been comparing this game to Bioshock, but that is an inaccurate comparison.  Just because there is a lot of water and water effects around your character does not make this game even remotely close to Bioshock.  The action is not very good, and you have several melee options, as well as some rifles to collect.  The combat consists of approaching your enemy and hitting him, then backing up while they attack, then approach and repeat.  The monsters subscribe to the jump out from the shadows (ala Doom 3) mentatilty to provide cheap scares, however there are some tense moments.  The color palette is pretty bland as the ship is iced over, so lots of blue and grey.  Some areas of the ship heat up to melt the ice, and the true colors come out, and look very good.  Combat overall is actually pretty bad compared to current action games.  Keep in mind that this game is not about the action, which makes me feel like this is more of an adventure game. Very good story, creepy atmosphere, and great graphics make this a good choice overall, just know what you're getting into. Also this game is a graphics whore, so have a good system to run it!"
5,Great wii nunchuck alternative,I can finally play Mario kart without using that stupid wheel adapter! These controllers work perfectly on games that allow the classic controller configuration.
4,Pretty good,"There is a just barely noticeable delay between the game and the wheel but besides that it is very good. It is perfect for gram turismo and forza motorsport but with the delay, it's difficult to play forzs horizon with so much drifting."
5,The ship that brought Armada back from the brink of death,"Just a counter point to Brian Brown's negative review, based on ""lack of imagination"" due to using a non cannon based ship. The aesthetic of the ship been pleasant or unpleasant is for everyone to decide on their own. I am just thankful, and excited that such an amazing table top game like Star Wars Armada is alive, and getting new ships out. I have not seen so many people playing on Table top Simulator or Vassal in a long time. I'm happy to see ships from the vast Star Wars universe, make it to my favorite game. I hold this ship accountable for all they hype, and I'm so glad rebels will have a ship that can dish it out like the SSD. Thank you FFG"
2,Works but has one issue,It does the job for replacing the dock. However my unit doesn't charge the switch so take that into account.
5,"Great case, holds all of games and controllers with ease.","This was a great product, it fits my needs exactly. It holds my Nintendo Switch with connected controllers, additional joy con and a charger and cable along with my games. It is a snug fit but it fits all in there none the less. The case is nice too, I needed something to protect the console from the kids, it has a screen protector that goes on nicely. I am not a fan of the plastic controller case as it does not fit the slide and strap on without having to take it on and off. The only other thing I wish was that there were additional games slots on the back side of the flap. Overall though I am very pleased with my purchase and it is working out nicely for me."
1,Bad Card,Absolutely astounded. Purchased this for my son for Christmas. Card arrived intact with no visible signs of tampering; however he is unable to use as card is showing as invalid.  Someone has perpetrated fraud at my expense.  Too bad this system will not allow negative stars.
5,Great! Gift for a man who loves video games like my husband!,"My husband is in the Marines and he travels and trains a lot.  If he's away training or always on the road away from home, PERFECT BUY. Its so inconvenient to check into a hotel that doesn't host video game capability during our numerous stays when we travel. So I got him this and all you need is internet connection if you're playing online. He loves it and now I can have the TV while he enjoys playing PS3. Its clear and very easy to load up. pace for your chords and controllers. This was the best thing Ive brought him. GREAT GIFT! GREAT INVESTMENT."
1,One of the worst games I've ever played,"This is not a review because I'm a new player and the game is too hard. I am a high level player of these NHL games and after a full week of playing and giving it countless chances, I can say that this is one of the worst games of all time. The features are amazing. I love how in depth the game is. But the gameplay itself is beyond pure garbage. The opposing AI will never ever be off your player. They can read exactly where you're going and make turns as you make them. Physics means nothing to the opposing AI while your AI is a joke. Passing feels completely random and don't even bother using stick lift. It doesn't work. The AI has a recovery time of zero while you get held down by unrealistic physics. I can't even begin to explain how frustrating it is. I like things to be difficult. I don't want to easily win every game. Losing games is good because that means the challenge is there. But I cannot deal with feeling cheated because of how unfair the game is. Winning even feels bad because the experience is so frustrating. EA is awful and I cannot stress enough that no one should waste their money on this horrible game."
5,Great MOBA Mouse,Great mouse.  Use it for Heroes of the Storm.  The first thing I noticed was just how much more precise and faster my mouse movements were over my old mouse.  I love Steelseries products and this one definitely has improved my MOBA performance.
1,Uses your phone,60 fps means 60 frames per second. It has no screen . It's like giving airspeed for a lawnmower.
1,Product description doesn't say anywhere that the DLC promised is ...,"Product description doesn't say anywhere that the DLC promised is not contained on the disc. I bought this so that my wife and I could share Fallout 4 with all the expansions between out two Xbox consoles. I feel misled and gouged by Bethesda, for shame."
1,"Just the console, eh?","If you choose to buy from Jixandplumby BE WARNED he VAGUE Advertises the console so he will end up NOT sending you the AV cable, NOT send you the AC power adapter and NOT EVEN a controller!"
5,With this controller no matter the size of the hand it is very comfortable. I bought mine with added triggers,Absolute top notch controller. I own scufs and use them all the time. I decided to change to aim because of the back button placement. I have small hands and have to reach to hit each paddle. With this controller no matter the size of the hand it is very comfortable. I bought mine with added triggers . They did take time to get use . 4-6 hours of use and youre good to go. The sticks are custom and the top part of the stick can be removed for an easy change. This controller beats scuff hands down. Get one! Bottom left is the back of the aim controller.
5,Great game. Great price. Great time losing friends you hate anyways,Classic fun. Grab some friends and crowd around the tv. Destroy friendships in a matter of 10-15 turns. Guaranteed to help you finally get that divorce you've been trying at for years. Bring this to your grand mother funeral. Its guaranteed to rip the family apart.
5,Great for racing games,My husband loves having this to use for his racing games. He did have make a stand for it otherwise it was a little awkward to use. But otherwise it works great for him and makes easier for winning the races.
5,"Wait patiently, don't buy from scalpers","First things first I love these controllers because it has the legend of zelda on it and I'm a fan and buying these are worth it. Now don't buy from scalpers these joycons are being back in stock over time but they sell out fast, my first set of these joycons are bought from a scalper for 108 dollars do I regret it yes because I thought these are sold as limited quality and well not be back in stock then amazon listed it for it's original price so I bought another pair. People who are reading this be patient check back every now and then to see if amazon stock up and buy it from it's original price, don't be like me and regret it from buying it from a scalper, have patient's."
5,Best Nintendo switch bundle on Amazon,Hands down the best bundle you will find on Amazon for the price you cant beat it comes with everything  you need for your Nintendo switch console
1,All I wanted was a Wave Race 64 equivalent,"I didnt get anything near to it. The graphics and water mechanics are sad compared to a 25 year old Nintendo Game Wave Race 64. This game is just a cheap phone game adapted to the Switch. I got mine for 10 bucks, not bad. Little kids would probably love it. I didnt."
5,Great!,This works great! The only small problem is that it's 6 ft. long and I'm pretty sure that's because it's for PC but I use it for Xbox so I have all this cord laying on me. But it works and that's all that matters!
5,Great headphones,Great headphones!! Great sound quality and microphone. Very pleased with this purchase. The colors on the side are really fun!
2,"Not a ""full"" kit no short 3 wire for the Vive.","If it's a ""full"" pack how come it don't include the short cable for the Vive. Very disappointed kid at Christmas time when he couldn't play it right out of the box because it didn't have that short cord for the Vive. Good thing dad knows his way around electronics cut the original cable shorter soldered the wires together didn't mess with the HDMI cable just used a 2-ft HDMI cable.  Resolved that problem but really disappointed with the bad description."
5,Works with my Hubsan Zino,"Got this to replace the cord that came with the Hubsan Zino drone that connected to my iPhone 7 plus. The stock cord had thick ends and the case I have on the phone has a dust cover and the cord that came with the drone would have required me to remove that case, which would have been a pain in the butt. This cord has smaller ends that don't impede with the case thus successfully connecting the controller to the phone. Drone works flawlessly with this cord."
1,Not the real valve. 2 to 3 times cost of the actual unit,This is 1000 to 2000 more than it should be dont buy these they are an absolute ripoff just wait for the actual valve to get them in stock
1,A big step backwards,"I have thoroughly enjoyed all the Flight Simulator versions, and was eagerly looking forward to this.  However, with a 3GHz processor, 1GB RAM and and 512MB video card, this sim is unplayable.  Frame rates average from 3-6, even with scenery turned down so much that there are about 20 buildings in all of Manhattan!  Unless you have or are planning on buying a new ultra high-end PC, this is a MAJOR step backwards from Flight Simulator 2004."
4,Aesthetically and functionally great,"I use this for work, and I love it so far. I have another similar one that is clickier, but this is satisfyingly clicky while being a little quieter. (Luckily I have my own office.) I like the fact that this one has the three shortcut keys above the number pad. The only reason I took a star off is that there are virtually no instructions on how to change the colors. Even after looking online for more detailed help it took me at least 20 minutes of trying to get it the way I wanted, and that ended up being by chance."
1,Same old ...Same old,"Not worth the money.If you have last year's game,you have this one.NFL please let someone else make a football game..."
5,Great!,"It arrived right on time, and the system was not damaged at all! I got it new, but it was worth it. The only thing is that it does not come with an hdmi cord. Thankfully, i had one at home. I highly recommend this product, but just make sure you have an hdmi cord. It is much more clear with jt."
1,False listing,"Not a digital code. Do not buy, false listing description. Unless you want a physical card and a 1 to 2 week wait time. Product is not advertised correctly."
5,Cyborg F.L.Y. 9,"If you want a flight stick for your games, this is the one to get.  Set up is a little difficult, since it tells you to hit the connect button on the Xbox and the controller, but it doesn't show where the connect button is (on the bottom with 3 little white arcs above it).  Once connected it is a pleasure to use, and adjustable to fit any size hand.  Be sure to get a battery charger and some rechargeable AA batteries because it does not use a charger or a cord."
1,a disappointment,"I'm going to keep this simple. There's a lack of depth in this game that makes it very difficult to immerse yourself in. The emotions help, but you're just as well off playing TS3 because they are practically advanced moodlets, and in my honest opinion, moodlets were just as fun. The only thing this game has going for it is build mode which is a huge advancement. Actual gameplay is a bore."
5,Great Game,No problems at all. All the codes work and the game runs perfectly.
5,Adaptador de control de wi,Para jugar resort se necesita
5,"Great case, lighter blue than pictures",I love the case. It's definitely a more pastel blu perfectlye than the pictures but I was hoping for that. So far the only issue I have is that it doesn't line up perfectly with the buttons on the joycons but it still does the job just fine.
1,Far From Great,"If this had been my first computer jigsaw puzzle game, I would not have purchased another.  I found it difficult to use, and the pictures appear to have been taken from the game creator's personal photo album.  The  photography's not very professional, and they're not particularly  interesting photos to piece together.  I'd rather spend a little more money  and get a Puzz-3D game."
5,"Durable, solid keyboard with excellent lighting features and great tactility.","This is a great mechanical keyboard.  The switches are light and have a good tactile response, allowing you to type quickly and with conviction.  This thing is a workhorse.  I use it for programming several hours each day.  The fact that you can customize each individual key's color makes this keyboard ideal for a large number of applications.  I used to own one of the original BlackWidow keyboards and while that was also a great keyboard, this one is even better.  The Synapse driver software saves your lighting, mapping and macro configurations to your Razer account.  This does require you to log in once, but that's about all you have to do.  You can of course save and load your configuration without having internet access.  You just need internet access to download the driver and register for an account, that's it.  This keyboard has made typing much more ergonomic, enjoyable and efficient.  Worth every penny."
5,My sailing fanatic son loves this game,"I bought this as a christmas gift for my son (10) who loves to sail.  When I looked at it closely when it arrived, I worried that perhaps it would be too sophisticated for him.  But he loves it, and says the graphics are really cool.  My husband plays it too and they are both learning more about sailing as they play.  My husband (almost no sailing experience), and says the game is helping him to understand racing more, and my son can try different strategies and see how the game reacts.  We live in a cold area, so it's a great way to enjoy sailing while we wait for warm weather so we can get out on the lake!"
4,Customer Service Outweighs Product Quality,"I've owned Xbox rechargeable batteries before and the problem I've always had is that I needed to replace the batteries themselves every time to charge. This docking station intends for you to replace the battery first, and never have to touch it again. The problem I encountered is that the plastic hooks that keep the battery locked in are very weak and broke on one of the batteries after the first use. In addition, the dock station is VERY picky, and it takes more time than it should to dock my controller than it should. I am working with the company via their warranty policy to fix these issues. So far their customer service has done a much better job than the product itself has. All in all I wouldn't purchase this again, but if you're looking for something cheap and temporary, this product is for you."
5,Hard to find slim fit wireless remotes that don't break the bank.,Was exactly as expected and worked easily out of the box.
1,Update just took long,Just took long
1,Don't bother buying a physical copy there is only 5 ...,Don't bother buying a physical copy there is only 5 GB of data on the disk and you will be required to make a 19 GB download before you can play the game. Just get a digital copy or don't bother at all.
5,Amazing Game,"I've played through the first 2 sections (got the first 2 achievements) and I really love this game so far. I love the fluid motions of Altair and have not really noticed the glitchy, frame rate issues that I've read about on the IGN review. The controls are very responsive and after the tutorial at the beginning I feel I have a pretty good grasp of them. I love running and jumping off building to scare the people below. The voice acting is also excellent. I can't say enough good things about it."
1,Unbelievably awful,"Being a fan of Hellboy, I was kind of looking forward to Hellboy: The Science of Evil.  However, also being a veteran gamer, I wasn't looking all that forward to the game, simply because of the terrible history of licensed video games.  Well, I didn't expect too much out of the game, but what you get here may even be below your lowest expectations.  Hellboy: The Science of Evil puts you in the shoes of the title character as you brawl through numerous hordes of baddies and take on the occasional boss.  That's it.  That's all you do from beginning to end in this game, and it gets boring very, very quickly.  Not to mention that the game as a whole is quite short, quite easy, and features some technical issues that all combine to make the game quite bad.  The game features some bland environments and choppy animation, and the clipping issues are more distracting than anything else.  Co-op multiplayer is also available where you can play as Abe Sapien and Liz in addition to playing as Hellboy, but it offers nothing to improve the experience at all.  Hellboy film stars Ron Perlman, Selma Blair, and Doug Jones lend their voices to the game, but they all sound so bored that they just add nothing.  No matter how much of a Hellboy fan you may be, avoid Hellboy: The Science of Evil like the plague.  There's no challenge, innovation, or anything else to even come close to holding your interest."
1,Reconsidering pre-ordering on Amazon,Had to cancel my pre-order since I wouldn't get this edition from Amazon until late September-Early October. I pay for prime every year purely for the pre-order benefits and this one failed me horribly
5,The third time was a charm,"I finally found a controller for Microsoft Flight Simulator that delivered what I was looking for without spending thousands of dollars.  It will only get better with updates in the future, but as delivered it was easily better than the other controllers I have purchased. The setup documentation was good, but the configuration documentation could have been better. I personally would only use it with an Xbox Series X.  The trim mechanism is a bit sensitive, but as I previously stated, compared to the other 2 controllers I purchased it is the without question the best controller overall."
5,It works fine. Battery loader indicator is very useful,It works fine. Battery loader indicator is very useful. My control fits very well to it. The shape of the charger allows to save space and it can be placed in reduced areas. It can connect directly to the xbox which is so convenient as there is no need for one more wire behind all the electronics. I am happy with it.
5,Very pleased,I was skeptical about buying this because of the price. I was wrong. The origional charger was eaten by our dog so I figured for the price I would try it. It works just like the origional no problems. the Nintendo DS Lite is my son's favorite toy. I am so happy I found this charger.
5,Great price and an easy application.,Excellent deal!  These are quality screen protectors and fit the switch lite perfectly.
1,Another Defective DOA Unit,Another DOA Unit here. It is going back on Monday. It looks like the problem is a little more widespread than originally thought.
5,Five Nights at Freddys,Amazing game...very suspenseful and Scary...I would recommend everyone try this game... I am looking forward to purchasing the game as soon as I get back fro. My business trip.
5,Cord is long enough,This is an off brand wired control we got for our Xbox 360. At first the kids were skeptical.  But It works well at a fraction of the cost. Love it.
5,"Great game, ignore the bad reviews","All the negative reviews are just people salty about the facial animations and such, I understand they need fixing but hopefully once a patch comes within the next couple of weeks everything will be better, also the game is super addictive, put 11 hours into it once I got the game lol, thankfully it was my day off from work but I recommend if you're new to the series since it's a brand new fresh chapter"
1,Id rather have a buffalo take a diarrhea dump in my ear than have to buy this,"The box isn't even what's on the page, it's just some Chinese crap. It does NOT work with the genesis model 2. It works with my SNES, but I already have an adapter. DO NOT BUY THIS AT ALL COSTS. I'm returning it and it hasn't even been in my house for a day."
1,Malfunctioned with first use,"I bought this memory card when i bought Final Fantasy IX. It was the first time I used the card and my FFIX data was the only thing saved on the card. After 11 hours of gameplay I tried to load my game only to find that the data was corrupt and my saved game unrecoverable. If you want to be able to load your games I recommend a Sony memory card. It costs a few dollars more but I have never had one fail on me. I used the same one for 3 years and it never failed I used this one and it failed on the first time. Oh, and the storage case broke out of the box."
5,Five Stars,Daughter wanted this FOREVVVVVER. Got it for her and now I never see her...
5,AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!,"This game is awesome. I bought this game with my daughter and we wanted to check the reviews, but there were none. My daughter decided to open it anyway and she played it for 5 hours straight, no breaks. OMG! She says that it's really addicting and that even at the hardish times, she says that it's still fun for a challenge. And just a tip, when you are done playing and want to stop and when you go to ""exit to map"" or ""exit to menu"" it will say ""every thing that wasn't saved will be gone"", when it saves-a hippo's head wil spin on the left, that's when it's saving."
1,Warning! Buyer Beware!,"Do not, I repeat, do not buy this particular bundle. The free game code expired in December, and Microsoft will not allow you to redeem it. Their support folks said to get a refund from Amazon, so I'm returning this. I'm not happy. False advertising!"
1,SCALPER,Scalper's are not okay. Shame on Amazon for not taking these down.
5,Awesome!,"I have both the 4c and now this 5 and they both are great devices, but I could instantly tell a HUGE difference on responsiveness and precision! This thing is so accurate and smooth you won't regret it.. is a gamechanger for sure it makes for next level immersion in games I've previously played before without the tracker. Like I'm playing an entirely enhanced game were you just turn your head slightly and it pans the camera over for you or locks onto targets with your eyes plus much more. Solid purchase for sure"
5,I love this edition!,Trying to get the Nano Block Prinny all back together was the funniest part of enjoying this edition. Both games are pretty good too!
2,Good only as a game,"This product is only good if you wish to play a game, but not if you realy want to get somehelp in picking numbers for a lottery.  The discription given for this product is wrong as there is no way that it allows you to see what the results are from checking the results of the previous winning numbers.  It is not worth the money to buy."
5,Does it job like other brand name one!,Love the color and material on this steering wheel and pedal set. Try it on PC and xbox and works fawlessly. Wheel turning feel is good. Pedal is a bit soft but I can live with that. I'm not a frequent gamer so this wheel fit what I needed.
5,The only caveat is that it requires a good usb power supply to function properly,"This works perfectly.  The only caveat is that it requires a good usb power supply to function properly.  I first tried a 2a Samsung charger with a USB a to c cable.  The switch powered on and displayed video just fine, but all four of my pro controller kept disconnecting and reconnecting every 5 seconds or so.  Once I switched over to my Google Pixel's Usb-C PD charger everything worked perfectly."
5,Good quality product,"These headphones give good clean sound and have the needed cables , ties , and adapters to suit virtually any end use case. I really like how simple they are and that they have the sides clearly marked if you are just listening and dont need the mic it tucks up and out of the way no problem. I definitely like these headphones and will update should that ever change"
5,A Wonderful Suprise,I didn't know what to expect when I purchased this game but I must say I am glad I got it.  The gameplay is fun and the basics are easy to grasp.  There are quick tutorials in the first few battles that give good explanations for the various options during battle so there is no confusion.  The more you play the deeper the battles can become depending on how you play.  New characters and formations are introduced that really allow you to decide how you want to play.  Certain formations are better for defense while others excel at offense and there are other formations that can give stat boosts depending where you place your characters.  Another good point is that the game offers three difficulty levels so the player can pick a difficulty that best suits there skill level.  I have played with all three difficulty levels active and there is a difference that becomes more apparent as you progress further into the game.  Easy mode is very good for players who don't play many tactics based RPGs and allows you to focus more on the story.  Normal is good for just about anybody who enjoys tactics based RPGs and has some skill in them.  Hard on the other hand starts off not to bad but gets really intense later on.  So be prepared with the best tactics you can muster or you will end up being very frustrated very quickly.  The story so far has been better then I expected and the ability to bond with some of the characters really adds a fun element to the game as certain choices will effect how those characters feel about you.  In the end this is a fun game with lots to offer for most gamers.  Oh and the mouse pad and pillow case are actually good quality as well so don't think there just going to send you some cheep freebies.  The soundtrack is also rather good and is worth a listen if your a fan of game soundtracks.  Have Fun!
5,"Fantastic, fun, and positive game for the whole family.","Fantastic game.  Played it with the kids and they absolutely love it.  Bright and colorful levels, fantastically cute and well designed characters, and engaging fun gameplay make this a must have for any XBox owner.  The framerate on the XBox One X is smooth and locked at 60FPS.  And after all that, the message of the game, one of perseverance, positive action, and just plain fun is something that we need a lot more of in this world.  I got 2, one for us and one for gifting this Christmas.  I have a feeling, I am going to need a couple more copies.  Do yourself and your family a favor and give this game a try, you won't be disappointed."
5,USB C Charger for Nintendo Switch,Received product in a timely fashion and so far it has been working fine to charge the Nintendo Switch!
5,"Fully recommend this, especially for the price.","This is an amazing keyboard for the price. This thing is very solid and rigid. The keys are very rigid, no wobble at all and are very fast and responsive. This thing has been a dream to type on."
1,Horrible,I've seen game companies put out a quick product for the sure sake of gaining a profit off a traditionally favorite game. And that's exactly what EA did in this attempt. Sad.
5,Perfect charger for move controllers,"Works perfect for either ps3 or ps4 versions of the move controllers. The only difference between the move controllers, is the USB charging connector. Ps3 used mini USB, while ps4 uses micro USB. For this charger, it doesn't connect there. It uses 2 prongs on the bottom, so either model will work. Super easy to place the controller into, and take out of. Great price, and works perfect. Great buy!!"
5,Thank You!,"Thank you EA Active for finally giving me what I have been looking for: Step Aerobics!! The game comes with 3 pre-set workouts for a step aerobic routine (not just 2 or 3 mins in between other exercises but straight step aerobics). They come slow, medium and fast. I just completed the slow and burned 310 calories (I am 5'8"" woman and 230 lbs). Granted its the same 10 min routine, three times but sooooo much better than any other fitness game out there (and I have them all!). I am hoping for Your Shape to maybe even improve on the step aerobics?!"
5,Great Product for price,"I've tested it out on my quest 2 and it works great. It's plenty long enough to sit back away from my desk and use comfortably. Material is good, should last a long time."
5,card lovers...,"If you're an old time card player like me, you'll appreciate being able to play all the old favorites like hearts, spades, bridge and pinochle.  And you can still explore several variations of poker games or relax with a nice mindless game of war or crazy eights.  Or, if you're really feeling wiped out, just pull up one of the video poker emulators and you can just spazz out for an hour or two.  Plays on both PC and MAC."
1,GAME HAS NO ADDONS ITSELF,THIS HAS NO ADD-ONS IN THE GAME ITSELF  BECAUSE YOU NEED TO ENTER  A CODE  AND THAT SUCKS  I THOUGHT THE GAME ITSELF ALREADY HAS THE ADD-ONS IN THE GAME ITSELF.BOMER
1,One Star,Wore out within a couple months
5,This game is awesome,"If you like Mahjong, you need to get this game. It has easy ones and hard ones to play so there is something for everybody. Many different kinds of colorful tiles so you don't have to play with the same ones all the time. The variety, of the puzzles, is amazing and you can get new ones on line with just a click. If you need a diversion for a little while....don't buy this game because it is hard to stop playing once you start!"
1,What's the point?,Can't get one. What's the point of all this?
1,"Decent build, garbage software.","Physically this keyboard looks good, a few cent short of a buck if you compare it to G13 from logitech. I wish I can leave a good review on this keyboard, I wish I can love it. But here comes the kicker, the software. It refused to work at all cost. I tried on both of my computer and laptop. Windows 10 and windows 8, 64bit and 32bit system, with all the setting me and my IT guy could come up. Tried both the software from the website and the disc, both were not working. Opening a tiny icon on taskbar was all it could do. This is going back to amazon."
1,Stop price gouging.,Period.
2,Give it time,"Most people who reviewed this did it shortly in. Not seeing all its flaws but focus more on the ""new"" facial features from real actors.(Cool I admit) That really is all the game has. Searching for clues and trying to read people. The story plays out the same no matter what you do. Its like you don't even need to be envolved. The shooting system is terrible, with no physics or realism to people you shoot.(That we had in Red Dead Remption) Nothing feels weighted or real.(The cars all handle like modern front wheel drive sport compacts not two ton rear wheel drive dinosaurs with leaf springs and you can not be hurt in them) The damage to the cars is also lame as well as the 86-87mph speed cap.(UNREALISTIC and really mad me mad. They give you real named cars of the period and you get a 140mph Duesenberg and you can go 86-87. Sound fun?) Now you wonder why I only focus on the cars. Well after you beat the game you have 8 lifeless miles of L.A. to drive.(There seriously there is nothing else to do and you can't go into most of interesting buildings.) The feeling of this game is like you control nothing. You can not take out your gun, you have to really try to hit a person with your car and even then they don't usually die. You can't go in the water(Like RDR), and there are no mini games or anything to do. The music really defines the game. There are two or three songs worth listening to and the rest is trash, they have talk radio and shows.(Samething Jack Benny is a good touch but the rest of the radio is annoying) I do not recomend this game to anyone. You can get all you need of it off of a video sample because thats how distant this game seems."
5,Based off demo it's awesome,I played the demo today at target. From what I saw this is going to be a very fun game.
1,Quit working after only 3 months.,Worked fine for the first three months then it started to have problem and with one of the charging ports. We tried everything we could think of to fix it and tried troubleshooting tips we found online. It was in that search that we finally found the poor reviews. This is apparently a regular problem with these where one of the ports goes bad. It lights up like it's charging but it's not.
5,awesome poker,"There seems to be more than a few video poker games available for computers.  I have purchased a few video poker games before that just were not what was expected, so I approached this poker game with caution.  Since I purchased the game my wife won't put it down.  She goes to casinos all the time and she really enjoys this product when she is home. This is a great video poker game."
5,Great Wiimote replacement,"These wiimotes work just as good if not better then the original remotes for the original Nintendo Wii system.  I dont know about battery life because it depends on what batteries you use. They look and feel great in your hand, they have motion plus, and I would recommend them for replacements."
4,"Fun, turn-based strategy RPG","Fun, turn-based strategy RPG. The story is compelling and the gameplay intriguing. With that said, my biggest complaint are the glaring bugs. I hope a patch comes out soon. Pro tip: don't send your followers back to base or they're gone forever!"
4,Logitech steering wheel,I stopped buying Logitech products a few years ago. Their gaming keyboards were crap. But I took a chance on this wheel and I have to say I'm quite happy with it. Maybe Logitech step their game up. I use it for Euro Truck Simulator and it works great!
1,BUYER BEWARE: Shop EZ is selling fake Wii U Pro Controllers,"Bought my controller from shop EZ. Listed with all the others as official Wii U Pro Controller. The item that was shipped however was an incredibly convincing fake. The only thing that made me question it was after playing Tekken Tag 2 using the dpad, the dpad was acting up and not really working. Then I REALLY looked the controller over and noticed the entched nintendo logo on the back was a slightly different font and more squished together than the real one that came with my Wii U bundle. Be really careful who you buy these from so you dont get burned like I did. Or better yet, just go to best buy or game stop to MAKE SURE its genuine."
5,Works great,Great product. Recommend getting a power outlet adapter
4,Solid Transformers game,"If you liked the High Moon Cybertron Transformer games, then you'll most likely enjoy this. The gameplay is almost exactly the same as the past two Transformers games. A huge improvement is that  you can play as 30 Transformers. The graphics aren't going to blow your mind, but the frame rate is really solid. Story and dialogue are kind of bland, nowhere near as good as War for Cybertron."
1,2005 called and they want their graphics back,"2005 called and they want their graphics back. Boring, repetitive and looks like crap."
1,Holy crap this game is awful,Holy crap this game is awful. Definitely not what we were promised in this game by the developers. Steer clear and get a different driving game.
5,Iron Fist for Disney Infinity,"Growing up, Iron Fist was one of my favorite characters (It has a lot to do with us having the same first name). And yes, I've always wanted to see a fight between Batman and Iron Fist. But as it stands, Iron Fist coming into the game is a dream come true."
5,Great Game!,"I was anxious to upgrade to the new Bejeweled 2.  I first downloaded the free trial and the 60 free minutes went way too fast.  After purchasing the unlock key online I have logged over 100 hours playing since November, it's that addictive!  The four different versions of the game (classic, puzzle, action and endless) all have bonus versions that unlock when you reach specific levels.  For Classic, it's level 20 and for Action it's level 9.  The Endless level criteria is somewhere over level 200 but I haven't reached that one yet.  This is a great game, if you liked Bejeweled you will love Bejeweled 2!"
5,Perfect if you don't want fancy.,Just what I wanted.
1,The product description says that this comes with The Witcher ...,"The product description says that this comes with The Witcher 3 Expansion, Hearts of Stone. However, it doesn't. There was no download code; in fact,the box says it is available separately. This is a complete bait and switch."
5,Takes AAA batteries,Cant beat the price for 2 wireless controllers definitely recommend getting if you have a ps2 just buy rechargeable AAA batteries and your gold. Controllers turn off when youre not using them which is a plus.
1,"Move along, don't buy this product","I never dropped this headset, I've always put it down after gameplay, away from any kind of danger. I had this headset for about 2 months, maybe a few weeks less- after extended use it of mostly switching between muted and un muted (possibly my most abused function of the headset) and a strange thing occurred: When the mic is muted, the level of volume i hear my friends in the party goes up, (but it is still VERY LOW to hear them). When the mic is unmuted- I CANT HEAR MY FRIENDS  AT ALL. As if the volume gets even lower when i should be able to hear them to speak to them. this headset is trash. it was perfect at first , although extended use put a strain on my head and i had to use a rag to add compression to my head"
5,Good Product,This is a great starter kit. Most of the bad reviews on here are due to bad sellers. The product itself is great if you want to get into Tau. You can make around 500 PTS with the current codex (8th).
1,One Star,It shut off too many of my Microsoft programs and did not run any faster
5,Excellent Golf Sim,"This is a very good golf simulation. The graphics are great, even on a PC without 3d cards.  You have different options for play, Tri-Click or Trueswing. The Trueswing has 2 options, horizontal or vertical (Vertical  you pull back and move forward the mouse while horizontal you move left to  right) Tri-Click is a bar that move up and down (Power bar) and you click  where it reaches your desired power. I prefer trueswing because i think its  more realistic. The are 7 courses with game but you can download new ones  from the internet. Also a course architect which lets you make your own  course. There are 3 types of play, recreation, practice and tournaments. In  tournaments you can play individually or in team play. I could go on more  about the features and there are alot more but this is just a great game  and anyone, golf player or not should have this in their game collection."
5,This is what my son wanted.,"My son wanted this game for his birthday. He loves it, he tells me daily about the lives of his little Mii people. He really enjoys what they do, and the mini games. Kind of like the sims for the 3ds."
5,Great,"Great keyboard and mouse combo, works well and looks great too"
1,Garbage,Didn't work. Would not connect to my Xbox. Garbage
5,"Amazing game, recommended for the money.","This is definately a good game, I think when my science teacher gets into astronomy with our class she will show this game, maybe though. This is an amazing game, I would definately get addicted to blowing up planets and trying to recreate Earth. xD"
5,"Adorable, Spacious, Good Quality Switch Bag!","I really love this case! I only had small travel cases, and this is exactly what I needed to pack everything I need and more for my switch! The aesthetic alone is clean, very cute, and very obviously Pikachu! I've gotten a lot of compliments on it. It has compartments for pretty much any switch accessory you'd need, and it has plenty of room for more stuff if needed. It even has room for a 3DS and games! There's an elastic strap to keep everything in place as well. The only thing I'd add is more velcro enclosures in the top compartment pockets to keep stuff up top from shifting. Other than that, it's absolutely worth the price. I'm super happy with it!"
5,great holiday gift,boys play it every night
5,You wont regret buying this !!!,"My husband asked me to pick out something for my birthday. I don't do gaming but all of the gaming keyboards are so pretty I couldn't resist it. I was so surprised and so happy when I opened this key board and hooked it up. How very pretty it is and works perfectly! The keys work soft to the touch and are very quiet. The different colors are just beautiful and the large mouse is perfect. This is made of quality materials and it will last years. I cant say enough good things about this keyboard except  its the nicest birthday present I've ever had. Thanks HAVEIT for my birthday present, and thanks Amazon for selling such good things to your customers !!!"
5,One of the best Remakes. Dog approved.,"I played the original Demon's Souls and it was great, but this remake brings it to another level. I can say it's one of the best Souls games I have ever played (I've played them all no kidding). My dog agreed with me too!. Get it and you won't be disappointed."
1,Why no pictures on the 5 star reviews? Seems fishy,All these 5 star reviews and not a single picture to prove they actually have it.  Something smells fishy.
1,Like Left 4 Dead?,All this game is horde mode for the entire game. There is no story you just get a gun and shoot stuff because why not? It ends so quickly and abruptly so they can sell you the actual story later in dlc. This game really disappointed
5,Wow.  I'm Really Impressed,"I had just been using microfiber glasses cloths to wipe my Quest2 lenses when they would fog up or get a smudge.  Turns out that doesn't work nearly as well as something like this.  Instead of just moving the smudge around, this actually removes all residue.  I can see when I'm using this that afterward the lens is genuinely clean again.  I wasn't sure this was going to be worth it but it's definitely worth it."
4,Good controllers,Works just like the old SNES controllers. Solid and comfortable. Easy to configure and use.
1,It pushes hot back air in,Do not buy guys. Research first. This pushes the hot air back into the PS5 making it even hotter. The PS5s integrated fan is good enough. Good thing I researched bfr using it. Returning it.
2,Not recognized by PC,Haven't been able to get the computer or company software programs to recognize it to add mods. Will update if I do.
1,Don't let the name Microsoft fool you.,"I purchased a, Microsoft Official Xbox One Play and Charge Rechargeable Battery Kit, for my Microsoft Xbox One controller thinking that getting a battery from Microsoft would be of higher quality. Unfortunately I was wrong. For the first month it charged just fine but then it would only charge half way and after 2 weeks it quit charging altogether.  Just goes to show you that when it comes to taking money from customers, there's no honor among thieves."
1,Come on... Really?!,"Not a rating on this bundle but on Amazon and the 'deals'. Why the heck isn't everyone allowed to take advantage of these Amazon deals at the same time?! By the time this deal was 'active' on the West coast, it was sold out! I had the same issues with the PS4 and XBOne! You'd think Amazon, being based in the west would have sympathy but they just keep disappointing me."
1,Doesn't work with Xbox One,"Very disappointed in these headphones.  The microphone does not work with Xbox One, even with an adapter (that you have to purchase separately).  If my son kept the box, we would be returning them."
5,"Yea, its real.","I know, I thought this was a scam or a joke or something but no. Its legit. Top quality. Two thumbs up."
1,The only good thing is the graphics,Graphics are amazing. That is where to good stops.
2,Refurbished Items aren't always perfect,"The console worked, but it wouldn't turn off.  The only way to turn it off was to disconnect the power cord.  That became frustrating so I sent it back.  Hopefully I'll find one that works but refurbished consoles aren't always perfect.  I wish there was a way to purchase something so old, as new."
5,Worth the Buy,I love the slim look! It is definitely more compact however it is heavier because the power bank is inside the console rather than outside. The fan is pretty much quiet and the console runs smoothly. I noticed that downloads occur much faster than any previous consoles. The controller it comes with has a nice grip texture on the handles. (Perfect for people who tend to get sweater hands)
2,"hoping I would like it, but I just didn't have the patience","New to the witcher series and this was my first game. Reminded me of playing elder scrolls, but without enjoying casual gameplay - it was very complicated to learn all the little details and aspects of how to play. Even after a week of playing, I was still getting introductory lessons. I forced myself to keep playing, hoping I would like it, but I just didn't have the patience. I don't have the luxury to sit and play hours everyday to be proficient at this, so I said screw it, and stopped playing"
5,Looks good,"Haven't used yet but looks legit, wrapped it up for christmas present!"
1,ONE OF THE WORST!!!!,"This is by far one of the WORST Final Fantasy games I've played. I DON'T reccommend this game to RPG lovers. If you like Final Fantasy, you wil HATE this game. DON'T BUY IT NOW!!!!"
5,Mother of All Mah Jong Games,"I am really amazed at how many variations to Mah Jong this game has.  I've been playing Mah Jong PC games for years, and this one beats all of them.  There are endless variations and even one based on dominos. You never get frustrated because if you keep losing at one variation, you can go ahead and choose from endless others.  Also, the music is beautiful, soothing, and calming.  Can't say enough good things about this Mah Jong Quest III."
1,Big nope nope,I bought this. It wouldn't connect. I had amazon replace it with another one figuring random issue... second one also would t connect. Went to walmart. Bought the same one.... it connected just fine. Whatever seller is peddling this model for amazon has a bad batch or something...
5,Cool,Wife loved it!
5,wonderful PC and Android gamepad,Well I purchase this about a week ago and I love it I love how the dongle for the mico USB came with it it works great with emulators on my cell phone also works great with emulators on the PC very easy plug-and-play the buttons are great I like the trigger button it has a lot you know a lot of give to it not broken in but doesn't feel cheap the vibrating Motors or strong you can feel the vibration of games that enable vibration length of chord is great I like how long it is definitely will buy from them again
1,was gonna buy but...,i read about the DRM and sadly enough would probably end up reinstalling it 3 times within a year or so and have a useless piece of junk. Looked forward to this game... guess i'll buy something else.
5,Just what I needed,Works perfectly for what I needed them to do. Hooks up great to bluetooth device to watch tv and not bother the sensitive hubby. Peace at last! Very comfortable.
1,Couldnt get my game and i see no where for ...,Couldnt get my game and i see no where for how to get a refund . Sony site displayed The Prepaid Card code you entered is incorrect or is no longer valid
1,Star Wars Galaxies Downturn after Redux,"SWG was an awesome game, unique among MMORPG's.  But recent mis-management by the development team has caused a series of problems, not the least of which is a mass exodus of the established player base.  Pleas from the players have gone un answered.  It looks grim for this once wonderfully unique gem of a game.  I would be surprised if it is viable long-term, and if is it, it looks like it will need to be scaled back significantly, as most servers are relatively empty now.  Sad.  Not a good place to be now."
5,GREAT KEYBOARD AND MOUSE,I love it. My wife just spilled coffee all over it. I took it over to the sink spayed it off. Then I removed the keys and dried it off. After putting it back together  it is as good as new!
4,Can not charge,U can not charge the switch with the case on
5,Best online for simulations!,"I went to ground school with the aspirations of becoming a private pilot.  While taking my flight lessons, I purchased this game and used it as a backup and practice when not in the classroom or in the cockpit.  This game is worth buying just for the schooling provided.  Microsoft did such an amazing job of recreating some of the greatest planes that I felt like I was sitting in my plane.  Using the many online programs that go with this game, you can talk to ATC, have live weather conditions and even see who's flying around you.  This is the next best thing to flying and I still prefer this version over FSX."
1,Controller may not work as expected!,"So I have used this controller for about two weeks after buying the switch in late November and it was perfectly fine. Despite having some missing features of the pro controller, it still felt great to use for the switch. Fast forward about 8 months, I have not used the controller at all and when I go to use it, the right joystick basically does not function at all. It has a mind of its own and my question is how could this happen if I had only used it for a short period of time and put it away safely? Maybe I was just unlucky to get a bad controller shipped out to me, but again if the controller wouldn't work I would at least expect it to not work out of the box or to lose its life after many hours of gameplay. If you can save enough to buy the pro controller, I would recommend that instead which is what I chose to do after experiencing the rightstick issue."
5,"Great value, loads of fun","It is a bundle that has the original game plus the squeal. There are lot of variety in both the games. The new one has levels borrowed from other EA puzzle games. Perfect for the little ones, neither kiddish nor mature. Right for the age. Lot of levels can be played with multiple people, you can just use a second wii remote. The gun is great and feels very good in the hand. Grab it when you see on sale. It is much better value than buying the original one."
1,One Star,"Pissed at Amazon and Nintendo for both releasing this prematurely, and not having enough stock for people."
1,Not durable,"I had it for a week and played maybe 10 hours and the left analog stick broke, only going to the right worked. Sucks cause I initially liked it a lot."
1,Magnetic,DBrand and valve have already found that magnetic attachments on the steam deck will damage it causing the fan to take damage from the magnets in the attached accessories they may also wipe your Micro SD card do not recommend anyone buy this product
5,Loved Them,"Used it about a year before it finally gave up on me, but I did not just sit around with these. ( Which probabbly broke them faster) I took them to school, work, and around the house doing chores, what I am trying to say is that these things have rock solid durability. The sound quality and mic quality, they are both awsome. I play siege, which if you don't know is a game about ether defending or attacking a position for an objective, one of the main advantaged ( In my opinion) you can have is the ability to hear other players footsteps, I heard my team and the other team crystal clear with these scoring me quite a few multi kills."
5,So far a great experience,"This is truly a next gen-console, compared to the ps4 the ps5 is an upgrade in every conceivable way, but maybe just maybe the design is bit of a letdown. And like any great piece of tech it has some flaws(beside the design), I have experienced this on the first day of using it. There are certain apps that do not work, perhaps do to software bugs that in my opinion add a bit of human error into something that would have otherwise been perfect. Though, I wager Sony will do something about that eventually. Overall, I think this console is worth the purchase and I recommend. One last thing. If you have a ton of games you would be wise to purchase a storage expansion, the available storage on the ps5 runs out quite quickly."
5,Awesome,Fun something new me and my son are enjoying it a lot of ton of stuff to unlocked in the game
5,Take this feminists.,"Bought this just to spite the feminists hating on the game. Women aren't the only thing glorified with their sex appeal in games. Men being overly muscular and good looking, women with large breasts, it's the art style folks."
1,What Happened here??,"I bought this game a few days ago and just sold it. The original was way better... Yeah the graphics are awesome, but its not that fun, and the going through battlenet to do anything is just gay!!"
1,Really disappointed,"Loved Elder scrolls, Morrowind, Oblivion, - have a system that can run the games so they don't crash -  but I really don't like playing this game through Steam. Every time I go to play it has to download something that takes an hour and then tells me it won't load. No response from Steam support. Getting kind of po'd. just want to play and not jerk with it. What I have seen so far with the ability to edit characters and move around - but agree mouse movement is crappy - hoping to adjust options to compensate if I can ever get back into the game."
1,Not brand new like said,Bought what I thought was brand new. Said brand new. When I opened it the Wii u pad had scratches all over it. Do yourself a favor and buy direct through Nintendo. Negative stars should be an option!
1,Great idea--flawed product,"We received the Wii Fit as a present last Christmas. It worked, as far as we could tell, for several weeks. Then the balance board would only work intermittently. We weren't sure if the batteries were at fault, or if there was some flaw with the board. Within 90 days, the board stopped working altogether. The system ""looks"" for it, but can never connect with it. It's a huge disappointment since the Wii Fit games require the board to work. When we checked with Nintendo about a repair or replacement, we found we were outside of the warranty period. Crazy. It's a great idea, but the implementation is flawed and the company, while willing to sell millions of them, isn't willing to make sure they work. Undoubtedly our last product from Nintendo."
1,"Hey, Capcom!  You get greedy, you get nothing!","Send a message to Capcom by not buying this!  I don't care how good a game may be; a one-time only save for the life of the cartridge is shallow and greedy.  Yes, they deserve money for their creation, but this is going too far.  I for one (as well as many people, I'm sure, will not be buying this...EVER because of this greedy scheme.  Capcom, you have just been knocked out of the top list of reputable developers for this heinous move.  BOYCOTT!"
5,I love it! Worth the money it looks awesome,I love it ! Worth the money it looks awesome!!
5,Excellent Value,Excellent product for the price. Definitely satisfied with my purchase and would buy the same brand again if these ever gave out.
5,This is not the dynasty warriors you are used to and that is a good thing. This is koei tecmo's to mix things ...,"People need to chill. This is not the dynasty warriors you are used to and that is a good thing. This is koei tecmo's to mix things up into an action rpg hybrid. Once you get used to the slower pace and flow of the open world battles, it gets its hooks into you. This game rules. Reviewers and people crying foul on the internet don't understand the vision. If you like dynasty warriors and rpgs, then this game is for you. I don't understand the hate this game is receiving. This has the best combat controls of any other koei game outside of 'berserk'. You can use points once you level up to grow your character in any direction you see fit. You have the most control of how to punish your enemies and continue your combos into the realm of the absurd. I. Love. This. Game. Must buy. Highly recommend."
1,Does not fit my Sony PlayStation 4.,Product does not fit my Sony PlayStation 4. My PlayStation is not described as Pro or Slim. Rather my console is described on the original box as Sony PlayStation 4 and this product blocks every port on the console rendering it impossible to use. After plugging it into the USB the fans turn but I can not use this product and I would really like to return it and get my money back.
4,Cool gadget,Cool gadget
1,Worst game I have ever seen on the WII,"Bought this so my kiddo and I could play.  We played it a few times, and it was so boring.  You are in a fixed position, so you can't stalk or walk around to hunt the animals.  I can't think of one positive on this one.  Traded it in after it just sat in the drawer for a while."
5,Ps4 Review after 5 hrs of play,Got the ps4 midnight. Beautiful looking console! Easy setup. Unfortunately my ps4 has the wobbles(not perfectly balanced on my table) but it doesnt bother me one bit. Had trouble logging into PSN at first but then i just logged out a few times and then retried and i got in. Most people hate the light on the controller but i kind of like it. The UI is pretty simple and fast. Controller is pretty ugly imo but it does feel really good in the hands. Killzone looks pretty amazing on it also. Not perfect but i still love it for what it is. Smooth and powerful!
5,Worked perfect for my daughters nitro 5 laptop,Need to get my daughter a controller with her new laptop that we got her for christmas and yes it is a wired controller but it works likes its suppose to and is made well to hold up to a 10yr olds gaming.
5,Awesome!,Awesome emulator and customer support for issues are super fast! Love it
4,real thing,"I have gotten other brands which quit working after a couple of weeks, but this is the Nintendo brand and although it might cost more than the others it is more reliable and lasts longer ."
5,We have a bowling alley in our apartment...,"...seriously, this game is so much fun for bowling lovers... especially if you wanna bowl in your underwear because you're bowling in a virtual game in the privacy of your living room.  Multi-player... it's fun for anyone."
1,WHAT?!,You really think you can get away with selling this for thosands if dollars more then it is worth?! What the heck!!!
5,It's a fun experience.,I punched a chicken and the townsfolk chased me. Seriously though. It's a fun experience.
5,Great game with good story and nice puzzles,"If you ever enjoyed one of Layton's adventures for DS or if you were fan of Mystery Case Files - this is definately something of interest to you. It's another very nice sample of how Nintendo DS is good platform for adventure games. Story is interesting and tends to keep you wanting to solve the mystery. I liked the quite unique gameplay (it's mix of adventure mechanic and hidden object style). I absolutely love the graphics! Music could be better, but it fits game well. After beating the main story mode you can run for higscores in minigame mode (and quite a lot of minigames there are) or you can have some quick fun with additional typical hidden object scenes gathered in what they call 'Hidden World' mode. Generally if you are adventure or puzzle fan - it's highly recommended. And for it's price - it's quite a bargain."
2,Not really sure what happened here...,"So, I have played need for speed for years, and was stuck on the previous NFS:MW from like 2005. So, when i saw this one, i had to preorder it. To give you an idea of how stoked i was, i havnt pre-ordered a game since halo 3. I was way looking forward to it because of the experience i had on the previous version. I still play the original quite often because i enjoyed the gameplay quite a bit. Then the game was released. I have put in a total of like 5 hrs on it and most of that was trying to see if it would get better. I really wanted to give it a chance, after all, i blew quite a bit of money on it. The only problem was, i felt like it took every aspect of the game i loved and threw it out the window. The handling took forever to get used to, and seemed almost like they were going for a more realistic feel(in a game that is obviously not realistic, i wasnt buying gran turismo). It doesnt even feel realistic either, more like a melding of the two that leaves it just a pain to use. I loved the first NFS:MW because there was a great story to it. This one, however, i have yet to see anything that resembles a story. I thought at first that i would be excited about being able to pick up whatever car i came across. And for the first hour it was really cool to see what stuff was out there. Then, of course, I got most of the cars immediately available and suddenly i had no goals. Yes, i could go for the most wanted list, but what incentive was there for that? The upgrades for your cars arent that spectacular. There was no story to move you forward. I felt really no inclination to do anything beyond running away from the cops(tough though it is because of the handling). Im sorry if i seem negative, but the only experience i really was basing it on how it was compared to the previous NFS:MW. If this is supposed to be progress, i will gladly stick with my 2005 version. Wish i could give back the game, but its digital. Got me hooked long enough to get me to buy it, but lets me down an hour later. If you are looking at all for the experience of the first NFS:MW, DO NOT buy this game. You will only end up disappointed."
5,Great controller,Great controllers that work perfectly with our gamecube. The colors are great and they fit perfect in our hands. This is our second pair since our new puppy thought the cord was yummy..lol!!
1,3 hour install!!!!????!!!!,"Fondly remembering hundreds of hours playing the old Starcrafts, I foolishly bought SC2.  First, it took half an hour for the cd to load on to my Mac.  Then, 10 minutes for patches to load once online, while being prompted this would take ""less than 2 minutes"".  Then, before I can play alone offline like an old guy like me wants to, I have to download a ""game client"".  Even on my cable broadband connection, this is estimated to take 2 HOURS!!!!  Wait now, this is just ridiculous.  Of course, you can't get your money back for unopened software, so I just got screwed.  Tried customer service, not timely or relevant.  If you are not a hard core gamer who thrives on internet play, perpare to be abused and disappointed.  SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!"
5,Wanted to keep it....,"Per the title, I really wanted to keep this baby. It's quiet, looks sharp and the controller led lights look great as well. The ps5 adheres to the stand well, its a sturdy stand and would be a great value for your money if it wasnt for the ps5 flaw ill mention later. All in all, this vertical stand is the best you can buy imo. HOWEVER, there is the reason which I had to return this. Apparently there is a design flaw in the playstation 5 for both the disc and digital editions. That design flaw is that over time as the ps5 stands upright the liquid metal will leak out of its housing and ruin the motherboard of the ps5 as it is conductive to electricity. No matter what upright stand that is purchased, those stands won't save the damage over time to this expensive ps5 hardware. I returned as soon as I found this out and bout a horizontal stand and a separate fan that plugs in via USB port in the back of the console. Sad I had to return this product as convenient as it was but I can't risk my ps5 to break on me in the next couple of years."
5,Coming from an XBox one ownership,"For a game experience, nothing compares to PS4 Pro. I've been playing a few games now and I am very impressed. The exclusive games on PS4 is overwhelming -  I highly recommend it."
5,just what we needed,great....just as described
1,foul language,Too much cursing and very disappointing.  I've been a fan of Billy Crystal for many years.  He is a better actor than writer.
2,Split screen is unplayable,I have a 60 inch tv and still cant see well enough to play splitscreen. Most of the maps are recycled. Zombies is legit and blackout is okay. This game completely missed on multiplayer though. If you are planning on playing splitscreen or even multiplayer forget it.
1,What a disaster,"Not even 1 star. I bought this for my sons birthday. When he opens the box, inside was an old playstation. I do not even have words to express my frustration. I've been an amazon customer for more than 10 years. And this is the first time something like this happened."
5,Highly recommend for all abilities,"This is an incredibly well made game that gets you hooked the first time you play it.  I started playing guitar years ago but after learning a few bits and pieces of various songs, I would get frustrated put the guitar down for a long time.  This game will allow you to finally learn songs all the way through without getting frustrated at any one particular riff.  Plus, reading tabs is MISERABLE and takes way more effort than it should.  Being able to slow the song down in the riff repeater is an absolute game changer... I'm not sure how anyone can learn guitar without the riff repeater!  Highly recommend for all abilities.  It's giving me the opportunity to learn something new and build a skill rather than wasting my free time getting humiliated by 11 year olds on Call of Duty!"
5,Great Deal,Just received my code instantly. The only other place I've seen that does this is instaGC and you can get instant cards there too. Thanks Amazon!
1,Probably the worst video game ever,"Probably the worst video game ever. The controls are abysmally bad. The game will require you to glide for approximately 100 Yards yet the glide ability will shut down for no reason a all after about 50 Yards. Prepare to repeat easy missions over and over and over and over and over again simply because the game designers failed to dial in the controls in any way. Controlling Batman is frustrating repetitive and downright awful.But that's nothing compared to the sheer awfulness of the constant Batmobile missions. The Batmobile is clunky unwieldy will get stuck on anything at all, every bench every concrete barricade basically everything will snag the Batmobile during timed missions. . The game requires oprecision driving from the Batmobile yet makes driving it about as precise as smashing your hand with a brick. Arkham Knight is unfortunately far less fun than smashing your hand with a brick. If you like getting a headache from a terribly designed game then Batman Arkham Knight is a must purchase. Otherwise just save the money. THIS GAME SUCKS!"
5,excellent product,Work flawlessly
5,Good!!!,As described.  Works great with my device
5,Classic fighting game with great gameplay and mechanics without relying on excessive violence or gore,"Great game for the 3DS, even years later. Many hours of gameplay with extensive single and multiplayer modes, it has definitely been one of the more enjoyable 3DS games in my arsenal. Kudos to Nintendo for continuing to bring out a quality game that is enjoyable to play and fun to visualize, all the while not having to emphasize on violence and gore to make a great fighting game."
1,Amazon should not allow ratings on unreleased products,"It's all Amazon's fault for providing the means to rate products that haven't even been released yet.  It opens the door to people like that ""gamer"" guy who go crazy with just a demo."
1,CD Key???  Are they serious?,"I have three or four thousand dollars worth of paid-for software on this machine, including Chessmaster 9000, and this is the ONLY one stupid enough to make me put a CD in the machine every time I want to play.  True, I don't play games much, so maybe this is ordinary behavior for games, but you can believe I'll never play the game, or have anything good to say about it.  I don't appreciate being treated like a criminal by software I have PAID for."
5,This is an excellent option as a gift for someone who owns a ...,Catch these on a rare discount and it's totally worth it otherwise it's the same as buying the same amount through your device. This is an excellent option as a gift for someone who owns a Nintendo device and you don't k ow what games they may want. If they're after a top teir game you may want to look at the 50 dollar option.
2,Wii controller rechargable batteries,The batteries only last for two hours.  Regular batteries last for three to four days.  I couldn't recommend these batteries to anyone.  I had much better luck with INSTEN brand.
5,Five Stars,Kids love this game and the price was perfect!
1,I thought this was a good headset but mine is mysteriously not working already,I thought this was a good headset but mine is mysteriously not working already. Probably used 10 times. Very disappointed.
5,"Fallout with friends, Like it or play another game","Where to start, I am an old school gamer growing up gaming on the computer with pinball or playing the original command and conquer. Over the years I have played many great games but fallout always has stood out for me. The mechanics of the game are different don't get me wrong but most gamers like that kind of exploration and making the game your own adventure. While playing fallout 4 i had a group chat with 4 people all playing and we would laugh about our deaths or fails when running onto a mine field. Now we have a chance for us to play together. I have to admit I was scared because so many online games just try to hard but after playing the beta I can see this game will grow over the years just as Rainbow six siege. (recommend for CS go players or hardcore battlefield players) All games have their bugs and Bethesda with their system pushes the limits on issues but they are trying something new. We will have bugs that is no shock to long time fans. But if you can look past that and just make your journey you will not be disappointed. The best part is I found a world boss and I only had basic stuff so would be a high risk of death but than multiplayer comes into play, i hit my team up and 2 mins later i had my team of 4 together ready to battle the beast. but 2 mins later we had 2 other people jump in to help us. It was great and actually fault like you were like those raiders you would see randomly in fallout games. In the end we all traded with each other seeing what the beast dropped for everyone. I just want to say go in it open minded. if you like fallout alone or with friends you will enjoy your money spent. If you are here just to complain how its not PUBG or COD than go to the forms we don't need your bad vibes. See you out in the wasteland and good luck to you all."
1,shallow and brief,"the game has the lowest character roster since super street fighter 2, except that was a much better game. The newest version in the series feels rushed in order to prepare for the evo pro fighting tournament scene and clearly left out modes and features that make up the back bone and overall quality of typical fighting games. Its a very bad sign when this game comes out and is unable to have actual 3 round gameplay, but mortal kombat xl comes out 2 weeks later and utterly destroys the game in terms of character roster, modes, story and ease of play, honestly, dont ever pay more than maybe 20 or 30 for this game. It's very clear capcom just doesnt care anymore about the core fanbase that has been loyal since '92"
5,Couch potatoes beware,"I bought this after reading some of these reviews, and I have to admit I was not disappointed.  My husband and I had just returned from eating too much out at a restaurant, and I was feeling fat.  I came home and hooked it up for the first time, and was moving in no time.  The menuing is a little klunky when you first start, but the secret is to get off the mat and use the wii remote until you become more comfortable with the mat and the menus.  Needless to say after a full meal, I danced for two hours, and guess what - no indigestion."
5,sound adapter,works great with my xbox1x
1,Not A Nintendo Product,"This cord is not made by Nintendo. It is a flimsy, unbranded knockoff. The advertising is very misleading. Avoid this product."
2,Macabre and punishing,This game is simply about running and evading.  It lacks the earned and fun power ups of a Metroid franchise game especially on the early levels. Samus on extreme Nerf. As you play it does get a little better however the early level constant restarts will drive most players away.  Learn to love camping AI with invincibility against your character.  Graphics and play are fluid with reasonable cutscenes for a Switch game but the stupid hard difficulty is not for all
1,DOA,"It was DOA. Blue pulse of death... going to give it one more shot after I get a replacement, otherwise isn't there another next gen console shipping soon?"
1,"Is not redeemable after purchase, must wait days to redeem, this is inefficient.",buy this from in a store with the actual card instead so you can redeem it immediately.  Amazon is horrible with digital services like this.
2,Can't do much offline,My husband understandably doesn't want our kids playing online with others yet so there's so much they can't do with this game. I don't understand why you have to pay a monthly membership and go online to be able to do anything. We haven't been able to figure out how to get multiple of our kids to play at once (even our teens who know these systems well). Pretty disappointed in that!
5,Amazing,Hours and hours of fun for my girls. Don't want to stop
5,Finally!,"Finally a dragonball game that brings back memories of the budokai and tenkaichi series. This is by far one of the better entries in recent years. If you were dissatisfied with battle of Z, this game is far better in every single category. The fighting mechanics are great and you'll soon find yourself not wanting to put the controller down. Character customization is an awesome part of this game as you get to create your very own z fighter from a variety of races (i.e. saiyans, nameks, majins, earthlings, Frieza's race). All in all, this game redeems the series for the failed attempts at trying to recreate the success of the ps2 games."
5,Best Game Yet for the DS,"Too many people are comparing the DS version to the Xbox 360 or PS3 version. You can't do that and be unbiased. There is no way the game can be rendered or played the same way on the DS as it is on the stationary console systems. I own it for both DS and 360 and it's a great game for both. But I think as far as DS games goes it really shines. Beautifully rendered graphics for the DS, excellent sound, and a wonderful storyline. If you're a DS buff like myself and enjoy portable games more than console games this is a must own for your favorite pocket pal."
1,Stopped working after a month,"After one month my 2DS froze, up to this point I thought it was fine, marred only by the fact the screen in open at all time making it easier to damage and scratch the screen. If that had happened it would have been a fault of mine, instead all of the button and the touch screen stopped working even though I took care to make sure it wasn't scratched and nothing lodged in the buttons. Even at the cheaper price I can't recommend anything that stops working after just little over a month."
5,Xbox is King,Awesome build love the quality and compact look of the slim and how it has the built in power brick great product Xbox forever.
1,Pretty Blue Light Right Out of Box,"Add me to the group of DOA, blue pulsing light consoles. Went through the whole song and dance I could find online checking the HDMI port and everything, but nothing worked. Also tried several monitors and hdmi cables. Can't get the system into safe mode either. Guess I won't be part of the launch day crew...."
5,Decent Controller,"Feels good in my hands and everything has been good so far.  Pay couple bucks more and get the more expensive one.  I'm not sure about the cheaper version, but this comes very close to the original shock 3 controller."
5,Nintendo Switch Carry all,Love the color and durability. So cute and fashionable. Lots of space for all your games and console. Like the strap for comfort of carrying.
5,Great mouse for the price,"I ordered this for used as a laptop mouse. I've become accustomed to my razer deathadder and wanted something less expensive but similar. This has the same buttons which is good. My only complaint is that I can't tell what DPI setting im on. The seller was phenomenal in helping me when I had questions about the mouse, for example I thought the  red button next the the left click was a programmable button but its not. its like a quickfire button or something. I am guessing the dpi changes when you press the button but there is no visible way to tell, no software comes with it but windows 7 recognized and installed it right away. I played l4d2 and I am almost just as accurate with this mouse on what I assume is 1200dpi, but like i said i can't tell. supposedly you can change it in the control panel. its definitely worth the price."
1,... research before buying the game but this is nothing like the Gran Turismo I use to play,I guess I should of done research before buying the game but this is nothing like the Gran Turismo I use to play. I like the old set up where you had to race against the Ai for cups and had to have certain cars for races. I see the campaign mode is like the old driving school where you get your licenses and that's it. I don't get why you have to wait for a races online. It makes no sense to me. Wish I didn't buy this game.
4,Great for playing games on AppleTV,"This works great with the AppleTV 4.  We're mainly using it with the open source Provenance App which work together flawlessly. The instructions aren't extremely clear, for example it looks like the controller supports multi-player, but not sure how that actually works--perhaps it is something within the App that needs to be figured out. The battery life has been great--some have complained that a lightning cable is required for charging, given the AppleTV remote not to mention your iPhone also use the lighting cable, I don't see it as an issue--one less proprietary cable to keep up with."
5,Very good game!,"Lots of options, puzzles and other play items.  Long playing.  A game that can be played again and again."
5,Very happy,"Very good. I had a little problem at first; with one of my games, it acted like the stick handle was stuck, and it wouldn't cooperate, but I remember back in the day, that would happen with other controllers too. I just took out the batteries in these and it has worked just fine ever since and I am sure it will. I was glad to find these on Amazon and I am very happy with them."
5,Cool,My son loves it for his ps4. It took him a day to get used to it.
1,Poor quality broke with in a week,"Had issues with the buttons and stick action from the get go. LL button got stuck and stopped working completely by the end of week one. Controller stopped working on a whole just after. Big waste of money, do yourself a favor spend a bit more and get a brand name control."
5,The best affordable NES clone,"I recently got back into retro gaming after several years.  Since all of my TVs are HD ones, I decided to look into HDMI NES clones.  In my opinion, this one is the best for it's price range.  Many hardcore gamers always talk about how most of these clones are off when it comes to the colors and sounds when compared to the original.  As a less than casual gamer, I haven't really noticed  the differences until recently.  In doing comparisons with other newer HD clones, I believe this system is as close as you're ever going to get (without spending too much money) to the original NES.  It is most noticeable with Mike Tyson's Punch Out.  Glass Joe is not overly pink.  Referee Mario's face is peach colored, unlike most clones that render his face the same color as his shirt...white.  Also, there's very little noticeable lag when playing.  The controllers, while oddly shaped and a bit think, have a similar feel to the originals.  I don't think you can go wrong with this console."
5,It won't let you do the whole experience until December 1st!,Don't freak out if it's grayed out or does not let you. I set my switch ahead and it works once it's December 1st. The first game is fun and I won't spoil anything!
5,Life changing game!!! Approved by Trump and Putin.,"Best game ever made, it will bring your childhood fantasies into reality, you will get appointed a job as the new head of the FBI in Trumps presidency and allow you to see into the future just like his sister Raven. I give this game 12 out of 10 stars. You will also gain the ability to speak Russian."
2,Lackluster,"Game play is clunky, story is stale, graphics are god-awful for the Switch's capabilities"
5,Sony Playstation 2 Dualshock Controller Emerald,This controller is very nice and probably the best. It works with big and small hands it feals non greasy(unless you have greasy hands) it has a nice vibration if you notice on some of the other controllers the vibration is too big. Now I own a PlayStation 2 and i have played with a lot of other controllers but they dont last the buttons get pushed in the analog is too sensitive etc. Although with this controler ive had it for 2 years and it has yet to break on me and people this is a sensitive object dont slam it it will work well as long as you take care of it. Also the button reaction on this is the quickest I have seen with those big bulky ones the reaction is very bad and sometimes the analogs dont work properly. You may have also seen this controller in black and teal there all the same price and all have the same durability the only differene is the color. I rate this item 5 stars because its the best controller out there.
2,Relisted to clear bad reviews? Poor QC?,"I knew this unit was a decent choice but often has lighting issues after extended use. Noticed this looked to be a new listing or model so i took a chance. Out of the box my Multi Function Display on my Throttle does not have backlighting and the Throttle Force Tensioning dial has no discernible effect of the throttle tension, be it at its max or min setting.....  unit are a bit light, it would be nice to have the bases weighted. I will have to DIY some steel plates to the bottom to prevent them from shifting in use."
1,One Star,Scalpers ruin it for people that actually want it. Don't buy.
5,Fantastic Game for Umizoomi Fans,"I purchased this game for my five year old to help him improve his math skills prior to entering Kindergarten next fall.  I was so happy to see that my 3 and 7 year old also clamored to give the game a try.  My 7 year old is veyr skilled at math and isn't really a Umizoomi fan, yet he even said he enjoyed playing the game and thought it was cool (high praise).  The game interweaves the characters talking and the games you play.  I like that the characters talk the children through how to play the game so kids can easily follow the instructions.  If you are purchasing this for a 2 or 3 year old I would say that you should be prepared to help them a bit.  My 3 year old has just turned 3 and some of the sections were a little challenging for him and he'd get frustrated.  One of the things I don't like about the game is that it's not that easy to skip from section to section.  You have to get through the first part of the game before you can move between areas.  I'd like to seem them change this if they make an updated version.  For my five year old I was pleased because the content is a good mix of easy and more challenging.  My goal is to familiarize him with addition and I think this game does this in a nice way."
2,"Oh, if only...","I LOVE this game.  I loved it for the Xbox, but couldn't afford one of those.  So imagine my joy of finding out it's available for the pc!  I ordered it as fast as I could and tore into it when it arrived.  I was playing along just fine, when all of a sudden, the auto-save stopped working and I couldn't manually save, either.  Exiting the game and trying to reaccess my garden led to me being told that the file was messed up.  Weird.  I uninstalled and reinstalled the game and started playing on a whole new file.  At the same point in the game, it messed up again.  I looked online and found out that apparently some users just have this problem where the game will not save after a while and to this day I haven't found a patch or anything for it.  If I'd known before I bought the game I wouldn't have been as upset because I would have at least been prepared."
5,Great controls - driving is way easier.,I use the controllers with FS19. It came preconfigured to work straight out of the box. This has made the game much more realistic and enjoyable. Driving and operating equipment is much smoother. I would definitely recommend this product.
5,Awesome!,"I purchased the Wii Active More Workouts after a couple of 30 day challenges with the Wii Active.  I must say the More Workouts is awesome!  The repetitions are faster so unlike with the Wii Active, I don't find myself getting bored and frustrated with the speed.  The activities are more fun and fast paced.  Where the inline skating got boring after a while because really its just doing loooooong squats and jumps it has been replaced with a surfboard activity where you are squatting, jumping, and moving your arms.  It requires serious attention and keeps your heart racing.  I did increase the resistance band by replacing it with a pilates heavy resistance band which really helps take the workout to the extreme.  I like this more than the Wii Active initial game which I still liked a lot but the changes in this game just make it more active and fun.  Two thumbs up!"
2,I got this as a gift for my grandkids. ...,"I got this as a gift for my grandkids. My son tells me that it was broken and would not work when he got it.  However, he sent it back and feels confident that he will get a replacement."
5,Perfect for wireless controllers,"This is the first off brand controller battery system I've bought that actually performs well. After reading the reviews I decided to give it a chance and I'm glad I did. With others I've dealt with short battery life, dead batteries, poor fit, dead chargers, etc. This one, however, is a winner. The batteries fit perfectly into the controllers and the controllers fit perfectly onto the charger. No wiggling or twisting needed, just set them down and they charge. My kids have never played long enough to run the batteries down so I'm really happy about the battery life. Everything just works and that earns 5 stars."
5,So much fun!,Working out is fun with zumba...it doesn't even feel like exercise!  I've attended numerous zumba classes and find that this game is just as much fun as a live class (and much more cost effective).  I LOVE it!
5,Great deal,Very nice
5,Fun and Instructive,"I searched extensively to find a collection of casino games that would be professional, fun and helpful with learning. Hoyle Card Casino Games is all of that. I had stumbled into malware trying to download a simple free casino game... a lot of trouble to correct and certainly not worth the risk. This game is a great treat and offers more bang for the buck than competitors. Enjoy!"
1,Great game ruined by greed and microtransactions!,"This game has great gameplay, but it is all completely ruined by the blatant emphasis on making you spend money on ridiculous loot crates. You are basically paying for a 60 dollar game with free-to-play design model. DO NOT SUPPPORT THIS GAME!"
5,I didn't know I needed one till I got it..,"I don't know what it is about this little thing but it looks really good to me lol. I love having it. I didn't know I needed one until I bought it, and now I won't ever use my mouse without one. It keeps the cord from dragging against the hole in my desk which is not smooth so it constantly catches on the lip, but with this it flexes really nicely. Just make sure you give a little extra room for the cord in order for it to reach the bottom of your mousepad with ease!"
5,"Fun, engaging, but linear.","The game is a very linear platformer, but the controls are tight, and the fights are just the right amount of difficulty.  Button mashing will get you nowhere.  Skill is required."
1,Nintendo will never listen and scalpers will never be stopped.,Par for the course.  Yet another exciting Nintendo release.
5,Five Stars,I love telltale games and so far this is my favorite
5,Crisis Core,"Since the other review is very lengthy, and covers pretty much everything, I'll keep this short and sweet. If you're a fan of the Final Fantasy series (particularly VII) then you should buy this game. If you don't have a PSP, this game is worth buying one for. I didn't have a PSP, this game came out, I bought a PSP to play it, I am extremely happy with my decision. I do recommend playing through Final Fantasy VII first as you will appreciate the characters, environments, and cameos a little more. If you do happen to play this first, I can almost guarantee you'll be shopping for a copy of VII when you're done."
2,False Advertisement,"When I ordered this, I was told by the description of the product that it worked with many different games in the Rock Band and Guitar Hero series. However, upon testing it myself, I turns out I got a drum set that only works on Rock Band: Beetles and any other game that came after. Meaning, not only was I misinformed, but now I was extremely limited to what games I could actually use it on."
1,Shame on you Namblow!,This game sucks its like they forgot that they needed a game ready until the night before.  This has to be the biggest ripoff in years when it comes to video games.  Do they really think this is a game? It's not a game not even close!  Buy wipeout instead. This tech demo is trash. Namco didn't even release a real demo because a demo would be this  full crap game.
5,Great Graphics,"After the updates it's got way better, definitely a good buy."
5,Fun for the whole family,"I bought this game to distract my kids from my drinking problem, and I have to say I'm pleased with the results."
5,"DO NOT READ THE REVIEW from James O titled ""Great Car Battery"".",He is just trying to spoil the movie Logan for anyone who hasn't watched it. Luckily I watched it on release day so he failed to ruin the plot for me.
1,Problems!!!,"Mine was defective! I had to return the console, because it could not read the games. Hopefully the replacement will do better."
1,meh,"Honestly, this is just another DLC that cost 60 bucks. Main story is short and easy, roaming around the different planets was cool for a while. I also remember that if the PSN is down, your game turns into a 60 dollar paperweight. The 4v4 is dumb, they really should of kept it to 6v6 or at lease 5v5."
5,Fun and Relaxing . . . an always WIN game!,"I like this even better than the ""traditional"" version that I have. I could live without the story, but it adds to the entertainment part of the game.  I like the option to shuffle the tiles when the game is ""over"" . . . this pretty much  eliminates losing.  My only complaint is that whenever I wish to leave the game, I haven't figured out how to exit the ""main menu"" without using the ""ctrl, alt, delete"" command to end the game from the task manager.  I'm sure there is a way, but I just haven't discovered it yet.  It is still one of my favorite ""kick back and relax"" games!"
5,Good case,Good price and sturdy
1,"Great game, service needs work though","I read through hundreds of reviews saying this game is terrible and that people should spend their money elsewhere. I wanted to see what the whole thing was about so I bought it. I do not regret it at all. Very addictive and after an hour or two of frustratingly trying to get the game to run, I played till 4:00 in the morning. I like how you evolve and conquer other creatures but my favorite part is when you first start out as a cell. The only reason why I would not recommend this to EVERYONE is that the online servers don't work, the registration keys might not work either, and getting the game to start up everytime is a hassle. Don't get me wrong, I love this game but EA has to fix these issues."
1,Retro Entertainment System,"This system is worthless. When I got mine I plugged it in and the game came on. When I tried to play the game it was blocky. The game I used was cleaned before using it in this system. After 1 short game the screen went black. No picture but I could still hear the game. I should have listened to the other negatives and not bothered to get this system. Waste of time. Look for a real Working Nintendo system. Sorry to disappoint but the reality is this is a cheap and worthless wanna be. This is not an Amazon issue, it is a manufacturer issue.  Amazon was very helpful in getting a refund. The only positive for this item. Stay away from this item!!!!!!"
1,You WHAT?,Why the hell is this 300 Dollars? is it made with magic or something? sounds like a terrible value for nothing special.
4,Good controller but..,"Great controller, little bit bigger than the original but comfortable for me. 4 star because sometimes the buttons doesn't register which can be frustrating, so if you play more fps games then i wouldn't recommend lol. Battery life is ok also."
1,Defective Power cord,"I received the power cord and plugged it in and the light indicator did not turn on, on the box part of the cord. But to double check i still plugged it into my Xbox 360 and it still did not work. After i sent the seller an email back he didnt not respond to me, and still has yet to do so, and i have now filed my claim to get reimbursed. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS GUY!!!!!"
1,disappointed,"I bought this thinking it would add to the exercise options that I enjoy on WII fit. Hard to believe that this program is not nearly as well developed as WII fit. The exercises are lame and simply repeat themselves over and over during the time you set for the work out. The instructions are only given initially and then apparently you are supposed to remember them or watch the screen. Watching the screen while exercising - especially during yoga is not always possible. Additionally, not all the selections for site modification are available and the music selections are lame! If you are looking for an exercise program for the WII - look for something else."
5,Everything organized in place,Love that it holds everything in one small place. Very organized.
5,Linus Tech Tips was right about how good this keyboard is for the price!,I really like the bluetooth capability and different color display options. Quality is decent for the price! LTT showcased this in a video and i took his word for it and i really like this keyboard!
1,The lighting is basically terrible,"I purchased this after seeing the unlit pad and this LED lit pad with world map and decided to spend the extra money on the RGB lighting. I was disappointed and returned the pad. It was a waste of my time because first, the lower edge was almost unlit super dim. Then it had strange hot spots in different areas of the map. If I am going to spend the extra money it only makes sense that the pad look evenly lit. Another thing, the picture is deceiving. It does not light in the manner shown. It appears to have to leds so it cannot show the different colors in the different areas the picture portrays. It combines 2 led colors at each of the ends of the switch. There are other options that are better but the pad is not as big."
1,Extremely disappointing,"I won't go into the details on steam downloads, super slow scene changes, or other software problems. If you loved Syberia 1 and 2, you'll hate 3. The story and the puzzles are not interesting at all. I should've waited until reviews come out, then I would've saved time and money with a peace of mind."
1,Constant Echo,From the start everyone hears constant echo. It came in a nice case and looks nice. I wish it worked but it's just constant echo so it's useless. I think these reviews are fake.
1,Doesn't fit Elite controller,"I bought these because one of the designs match the aftermarket front cover that I installed on my elite controller, but none of the three sizes provided fits the elite controller without modification. These are NOT as advertised"
4,good for younger audiences,"I bought this game as an alternative to the Black Ops or Call of Duty games my 9 year old really wanted. Black Ops is rated Mature so there was no way he was getting that.  This game, while also very realistic, is a great alternative as there's no simulated killing just paintball hits.  I was nervous he would be disappointed but he truly enjoys it."
5,Great product for fps gaming,"Absolutely love this, use it mostly to play siege, feels wrong to use anything else now."
1,Extremely unhappy,"This product has a destructive ""anti copy"" virus like program on it called ""secure rom"". It was very difficult to get it to install on my sons computer.  Once installed he was able to play it for 20 minutes before his computer crashed due to the secure rom junk on this disc.  The computer ceased being able to boot and required a complete re-installation of the operating system, programs and personal data.  I think the sims games are wonderfully creative but most of the titles and expansions are a royal pain in the rear to install with various incompatablities and problems.  Now we have the company treating it's customers, by default as criminals and putting ""secure rom"" tech on ALL their products thereby punishing all us honest gullible gamers who legally purchase the games.  It's well past time that these companies started treating us like customers again rather than criminals."
5,Excellent service,This seller was selling a Nintendo Gameboy and a bunch of games for the Nintendo itself. I emailed him with a request for only the games which he promptly responded to. We worked out a deal and I got all the games I wanted. Amazon said that I was supposed to receive them 2 weeks later but the seller sent them immediately and even emailed me the tracking number for the package which arrived 3 days later. I tested out all the games and they work flawlessly and look in great condition as promised. Quick and great service. I recommend this guy!
5,Five Stars,Nice ass product
2,Not for people with big thumps.,The problem I find with this controller is that the buttons are too close together. Resulting me hitting two or three buttons at the same time. When e.g. pressing the button in the center I actidentaly always press the the two bottons next to it.
2,"If you like to DIE ALOT, then get this game","Might as well call it Dark Souls 2, you die a lot due to lack of acuiring good equipment. The scenery is not destructable so if an enemy takes cover dont bother shooting at him even with the most BFG you got. Id say poor craftsmenship in game dynamics, nice scenery and guns and enemys but they could have done better. if you like endless shoot em and loot'n then this is your game but beware you will die so many times and its so annoying because they charge you a large portion of your money to revive you every time"
2,Looks don't add up to great!!!,"The afterglow controller looks cool and has a cheaper price point but you end up paying for it.  The buttons are great and the feel is too but the joysticks are terrible.  The sensitivity is messed up and does not allow for precision, and no you can't fix it by adjusting your settings on the xbox.  Save yourself the anger and spend the extra 10 bucks on an original."
5,This Genesis Delivers 40 games from Sega's hay day.,"The sound is not perfect but very playable, a first time Sega player wouldn't notice the sound but anyone who had a Sega will note the sound is off.  The games seem to play full speed and the graphics are good.  Too bad they didn't make it HDMI.  It is just mono RCA.  This is fun and if it breaks, oh well it was priced the same as 1 modern game."
1,"drm, 1 activation per letter, no sale","One activation per letter of DRM, 3. I was about to let my Prime account get it to me next day then saw the DRM horror stories. Sorry EA, great game, poor license."
5,Battle Stations!!,Absolutely love these stands. They look great in the wall. My battle station is ready!!
1,Never recommend it. Worst FPS gaming mouse ever.,"The worst FPS gaming mouse in the world. First, the design is really awful. What's funny is this mouse is called best design for hand, LOL. There is no where for my little finger and after using it for a long time, my little finger hurts and it's really not good for long time playing. Also, the mouse is pretty big. Second, the most inconvenable thing is the poor quality. After using for about two weeks, the rubber pad on the right side just fall down. And after another week, the left one also fall down. I have to use a super glue to stick it. For the left side I did a good job, barely can recognize the trace, but the second time I use glue to stick the left side, I mess it because I was so angry and disappoint about the suck quality and expensive price.  I don't understand how come such a famous and expensive mouse has such a suck quality. My feeling is really bad whenever I use it, and that's why I waste my time to write this review. Never done this before. So disappointed."
5,they work,good price
1,Totally disappointing,Sheer disappointment. Dances are so lame !! Like some kid classes. Same steps repeated throughout the song. Utterly boring!! Buck up guys! We expect much much more !
1,Seriously,Price increase is ridiculously stupid
5,Great buy,"Great, I didn't realize it was that long but that a plus, it works perfectly and it even is compatible to do a rapid charge on my phone."
5,"Great buy, matte black finish and is very comfortable.",Love this mouse. Just got it and used it for about 6 hours strait while working. At first it feels different because you hand is sideways but it is much more comfortable and you get to rest your arm on the desk so you don't have to have your wrist at an angle. It's got a matte black finish and looks great.
5,Must have game,This game is a must buy for the DS and Final Fantasy players.  So much to do in this game and I have about ten hours into the game and its great.
1,It's not worth 500,Everyone get a review and gets to share their opinion. So here is mine 1 star. I dislike my xbox one. It has had some issues. I have to reboot it every day and a half in order to get my dish reciever to work with it. The xbox live party chat does not work properly. Xbox customer support has been horrible for me. It has no good games that I cannot get with 360 or play station. It has potential but for 500 Microsoft should of worked out all of it issues first instead of trying to push it out.
1,I can't even begin to explain how much of a ...,I can't even begin to explain how much of a let down this game was for me. Sean Murray is a lying scumbag.
5,Wow,"This is the greatest thing I have every bought. Seriously bring me back to the 80s love this system. If you are thinking about getting one get this one! So many games, systems, and old fun. Great job on the product!"
4,the best i could  find,"we purchased  this for one of our grandchildren.  sad but true, the reviews are correct: it is  impossible  to  find, for a decent price, a decent checkerboard  these  days.  man o man......"
1,Activision needs to get their act together.,"My kid has been talking about Thumpback for months. Great job of building the hype, lousy job of delivering. Not having this released in time for the holidays is poor customer service, and will put an end to our purchasing of these toys. Just not worth having disappointed kids over and over.  We will redirect them to something else."
5,Includes Steam Code,"It's a great game.  There are dozens of reviews of Deathloop, and I presume you know what you're buying. The most prevalent question on the web is exactly what you're getting if you buy the package online.  So what you get is a physical CD (which still requires a broadband internet connection) and yes, a Steam activation code.  If you already have a Steam account, you just need the activation code.  Okay?  Have fun."
1,Poor Quality Control,"One had a rotten hazelnut in it, I let that go. Then I got to one with a rock in it in the same box. Almost chipped a tooth."
4,joking right?,"Are you serious..?? The description clearly says case, not game..! Duh!"
2,A total POS,"We've had consistent issues with console connection and the headphone jack has never worked.  My kiddo so badly wanted an orange controller, but we ended up with a pure LEMON!  Buyer beware."
1,What  A Bunch of BULL!,"This is the Worst Game and Rip Off in Video Game History.  It is Just like playing ""Godzilla:Save the Earth"" all over again.  We don't get the NEW GIGAN, KING CAESAR, TITANOSAURUS, VARAN, BIOLLANTE, or even that other made up monster KRYSTALIK!  We only get the one Made up Monster OBSIDIUS, Like I care about made up monsters, Biggest RIP OFF in PS2 History!  I feel like I am playing the same game over again, If you wanted all them new monsters, Don't buy this PS2 game. This made my Thanksgiving a little miserable.  I can't believe ATARI would pull a Stunt like this!  Oh PS2 don't get the New Monsters, But WII does!  I Blew a complete 40 Bucks on a game I already have!!!!"
4,It's Good But,"I first hated this game and gave it a one star. This was because of the servers problems and the fact that the game was very slow and navigation was a nightmare on my new i5 Dell laptop. Later, I played the game on my i7 XPS Dell desktop. The game ran very smooth. With the servers' problem gone, I am actually enjoying the game very much. Of course, there are many things that could have been better, but it is very fun."
5,Buy this game !!,"I waited so long for this game to come out on PS4 , it's finally here and I am not disappointed. Great game with absolutely gorgeous graphics and fun gameplay. Worth every penny and I paid the full 59.99 from PSN. Still I am very pleased with my purchase and this is a game you will want to keep forever so but it today."
5,Works,Fits Xbox abd now my Xbox is working again
1,Megaman is dead and Capcom killed him.,"Why would anyone buy this?  It doesn't even include 7,8, 9 and 10....Same Capcom rehash...."
5,Very color and useful,It so colorful love the combo set it can be used on PC ps3 ps4 android phone and ipad
1,NOT FUN,"OH man did I ever HATE this game. And there is no bigger fan of the HALO series including games, books, and comics. But this thing just stunk. I played it for 20 minutes and just couldn't stand it. Pulled it out of the XBOX and put it in the 'give away' pile. They got their money from me but darn sure won't get anymore. Going back to HALO 3 which i've played through I bet 30 times but HALO WARS is out of my house."
5,Really fun and exciting game for kids and adults!!!,The game is soo much fun. Definitely worth the money. It's a lot like Mario Kart and the visual effects are amazing as well as the sound effects. This game rocks if you have surround sound. My family has played up to 4 players and it can get pretty competitive. What I recommend is reading the button control diagram inside the booklet included with the game. This will help you enjoy the game right away. Really glad they made a new Cars game for PS4 as I also had Cars for PS3 in the past and loved it too. Definitely recommend it for everyone. My son is 7yrs old and he has no problem playing it.
5,Works as advertised,"It works just like it should. I just think it should be a little cheaper, there is not much to it."
1,Fake don't bother,If only zero  stars existed!! My game is fake not authentic and its a reproduction!! And i was charged for 45 bucks on it?!!! Unacceptable!!!!
5,Love it!!!,"This is a great game, I never seem to get bored with it and the best part is that it works well with Windows 7."
2,Possibly great game ruined by definitely broken UI,"I've been looking forward to this game for a long time.  I loved DA:O (I played through it as every character combination, hundreds and hundreds of hours).  I liked DA2 (I played through it one time, it was fun, wouldn't spend time on a replay). I loved everything I heard about DAI until I actually played it.  The graphics (especially the animations) are amateurish, but I'm fine with that, I love plenty of other games with terrible graphics.  The story often seems weak, simplistic, contrived, etc.  I'm not thrilled about that, but whatever, it's a game, as long as it's fun to play that's fine.  The one thing that really ruins everything is THE CONTROLS.  At least on the PC, the UI is AWFUL.  The controls were perfectly fine in DA:O, and (I think anyway) that DA2 was actually an improvement on the controls (even if it was a step back in story and scope).  How they got to the control scheme in DAI is beyond me.  Unless they never made QA suffer through the mouse and keyboard controls, I don't see how this happened.  It's not a minor problem.  There is some indication on the interwebs that Bioware is going to fix this.  I suggest waiting to purchase the game until they do.  (I would suggest getting the console port, which is what I usually do for games when they are designed around a controller, but DA has always had great keyboard and mouse controls and I'm uncomfortable with the precedent that would set.)"
5,Buying digital code while stationed overseas.,"So if you downloaded this while stationed at a U.S military base somewhere outside of the States, say, Germany, it will give you an invalid code error because it thinks you're from Germany. Use a VPN and set your location to United States and you will be good to go! I personally used Norton Wifi-Privacy, 5 bucks a month, I think there's a trial you can use though. Once the code is validated, remember to switch off the VPN or you will be plagued with bad latency since the game server thinks you are playing from the States."
5,Freakin amazing,So I have to say my first of impression of these headphones was astounding. The craftsmanship the feel is just amazing. Noise cancelling is there but could be a bit better the USB cord that's connected for the rgb effects could be longer especially if your using it for a gaming console however I am really pleased with these headphones they are absolutely perfect for gaming and I don't really have that much bad things to say about them. I am very pleased with my purchase and I feel as if the company took there time to make sure they came out with a great pair of gaming headset. Well done I definitely would recommend these.
5,Thank u,"Both work great me and my son loves it, thank u"
5,The most complete baseball game ever,"Two words...Franshise mode...finally somebody got it right thank you Akklaim Sports. The player detail is absolutely beautiful. The replays after each play make it almost feel like you are sitting in the stands or from the TV camera replay looks like you are watching an actual game. Expansion mode is also very fun with some very creative expansion nicknames and logos added by the software people along with some citys that should have teams such as Hawaii, Norfolk, VA, Puerto Rico, Oklahoma, Vancouver B.C.  As far as the gameplay there is only one flaw that I have seen and that is sometimes when you are fielding the ball your player chasing the ball might make a catch that looks like the ball would land at least 5 feet away from where he was standing. But other times you will watch balls bounce off of players gloves and watch squibbers get under the diving infielders. Overall this is the best baseball game ever made for ANY system. The realistic feel and no 17-15 games make it that much more realistic. I have played four games with scores of 8-5, 8-3, 2-1, and 3-2. I cant get myself away from this game because every time I turn off the playstation 2 i just yearn to turn it on and play even more. Triple Play is dead...come on EA Sports add fantasy mode and i might give you a chance again but right now All Star baseball 2003 from Akklaim is the king of baseball video games. BUY THIS GAME NOW !!!!"
5,Perfect - enough said,I set this up in another room in the house and it works like it should.  Perfect - enough said.
5,Awesome product,I have 8 kids and this Xbox rarely gets turned off!  We have had no problems with it and has been well used!
5,Turtle Beach PLa,"To start off, these are great. Now compaired to more expensive turtle beaches these put up a great fight. They sound great.  They are very comfortable.  I would recommend these to any one.  And the price wonderful.  So you will be glad u did."
2,2009 Not So Great,"There are no new players, some of the old favorite games are gone, and the new games are nothing special. The biggest issue is the cards. They are waaay too small and too close together. You can't move or sort them in your hand, and they are too hard to manipulate. This is a major problem considering these are all card games. Disappointing."
5,With my Steam controller I had to jump through hoops to get it set up to something I was comfortable with and it did not always respond as I ...,Oh my goodness....If I knew what I know now I would of never invested in Steams controller for my computer! Thank goodness for grandson's input because I would of never know any different. I originally purchased the Steam controller and I will admit it does do what it claims to do...unfortunately PS controllers rule. With my Steam controller I had to jump through hoops to get it set up to something I was comfortable with and it did not always respond as I had set it up to do. When I first started using the PS4 controller I found the buttons to be a bit much however with a bit of endurance it is like second nature now. The easy of the control of things is exceptionally well designed and I don't have to put batteries in constantly as I did on the Steam controller. I will state that even though I find this controller far exceeds my Steam controller that on extremely rare occasion the controller will divert back to what Steam believes are the best setting yet this is easily resolved by rebooting the controller.
5,Great!,AWESOME. I dropped my switch twice and still no broken or scratched screen
5,Awesome game for everyone!,This game is great!  Anyone can play since you enter your age in order to receive age-appropriate questions.  Great for the whole family and so much fun!  Highly recommended!
4,A fun way to get exercise!,"I am new to this kind of game, so I am still getting used to it.  But this sure is an addictive way to get exercise.  The only problem I've had has been with the mat which tends to slip and bunch up a great deal on our thick carpet.  After experimenting with a slip-proof pad for a throw rug and two-sided carpet tape (not much help) I hit on the idea of putting a chairmat (like those used under a rolling office chair) under the mat.  I purchased an ""ulta durable"" one with ""AnchorBar technology"" from Staples (not the bargain-price kind that can be rolled up) and this has made a tremendous difference.  No more slipping!"
5,It's so pretty!!,"I was so excited to use my keyboard and mouse, they're so pretty to look at!!! I was really disappointed when I went to use the mouse and the scroll didn't work. The seller was amazing, I let them know about the defective mouse and they responded immediately!!! WTH??? That never happens, but seriously they responded immediately and replaced it, no questions asked just an apology and a replacement. I appreciate the seller so much because I really thought this was going to be such a headache. There have been so many times where I just don't even bother complaining and just buy a different product because I don't want to deal with the hassle. They made it so easy and understood that it was their responsibility to fix this issue. A nice bonus was that I received the replacement super quickly. The mouse works great now and I'm just really happy I actually took the few seconds to contact the seller. Definitely worth the price."
1,Defective Product,"Lots of lag, save corruption, crashes, and perpetual loading screens. I was half expecting this too because I have had it happen to me a few times this year with games. I am so sick of the 'release it now, fix it later' mentality the game industry has. I really wanted to play this game too, but in it's current state I was left with no choice but to send it back."
4,Four Stars,Good Game.
5,Highly recommend,"Good purchase, have all I need"
1,Not happy!,"I hardly have time to get on Xbox... but I bought this controller in January... thinking it would have a good warranty... usually 1 year.  But the darn thing moves forward on me without even touching the controller... the seller said I had to call Microsoft myself and it had a 1 year warranty... but I contacted Microsoft and the controller is only a 90 day warranty item.  Very very disappointing that MS would put their name on such a horrible and CHEAP product.  Then Customer Service tells me... ""Next time buy an Elite""  WTH???  wow!"
4,Sonic the way he should be,"There are some things that are just better in 2-D.  Castlevania, Street Fighter, and Contra are prime examples of this, but perhaps there is no other series that is best in it's 2-D roots than Sonic the Hedgehog.  With Sonic Rush on the DS, the blue colored hedgehog is back in his 2-D glory as Sonic Rush utilizes both screens as you bolt through the levels at break neck speeds with all the classic elements you'd expect from a Sonic game: tons of rings and enemies, loop de loops, bouncing springs, and so on.  You can play as Sonic or new character Blaze the Cat as you take on Dr. Robotnik (he's refered to as Eggman more and more these days, but he'll always be Dr. Robotnik to me), but there's not much difference between the two heroes, which you'll notice as you progress through the game.  Since the game goes at such a break neck pace, it's easy to miss something you're supposed to grab on to or bounce off of, which can lead to many deaths unless you memorize the area.  This hurts the overall gameplay aspect of Sonic Rush, but the fact that this is a new Sonic game in all his classic 2-D glory more than makes up for it.  It's intense and fun, and for DS owners who had a soft spot for Sega and want some classic action on the go, Sonic Rush deserves to be picked up."
5,5 Stars! Perfect!,I have to give this 5 stars to offset for those morons that gave this 1 star for no reason or nonsense reasons
4,Its definitely a Action cyberpunk RPG found compelling and pretty damn awesome,Its definitely a Action cyberpunk RPG found compelling and pretty damn awesome... Fights are always challenging... Missions can get a bit tedious but i can say it won't matter as you level up character and have some great gear loot to make your guy a total badass looking technomancer. Not a perfect game but definitely worth playing..
2,I have gotten this mouse twice now...,"So the first thing I'll say is I am an absolute sucker for aesthetics, and this perfectly matches my pink D.VA setup. I had bought this about a year ago, and while it seemed a little cheap, it worked just fine and performed just fine. About a month ago, my mouse left click suddenly stopped working, which was sad, but it was a cheap mouse so I thought hey I'll just grab another one to last another year or so. I've had the second one a month now, and now the left click stopped working on this one. I tried to open it and see if something was up with the button, but it just was unclickable. Overall, not worth it - and definitely disappointed."
4,Another Adult Hooked on Petz Sports,"I bought this because I compete dogs in dog agility. I couldn't help myself! What a fun game. Not terribly difficult to figure out, so kids can play, but entertaining enough for adults too! I wish I could get my dogs to weave through the weave poles by pointing the controller at them! :) The dogs in this game are well done. Realistic in their looks and mannerisms."
5,old comuter game.  I loveit.,I love these computer games.  Am 78 years old and oughnt to be ashamed of the time I spend daily on them.
1,You'll be lucky if it works...,I purchased two of these 64MB cards...one as a gift and one for myself. The one as a gift doesn't work at all. I tried to format it and then it could never read the card again. The other works but it often corrupts the games it saves. I don't recommend this type of card. Your safe bet is with the 8 MB...I've had one for 4 years now and I've only had trouble with it once. It's great for the small games we play. I just thought I would get a larger one for more games but oh well.
1,Disappointed,"First time I am really disappointed by an Atlus product. Buy the JP pack version rather, at least they have the soundtrack with it."
1,Switch can't handle it,This game is super fun but man is it glitchy and lagzilla on textures. Playable..just barely. Sub zero is completely broken .clip through terrain .wont save .crashes wtf
1,These Joycons broke after barely any usage...,"Joycons have drift, and constantly vibrate without reason."
5,Happy with my buy,"I bought this item for my husband and he loves it. It hold all of our controllers and games and looks very organized. I'm happy with my buy. My only complaint was when  I received it everything had fallen out of the box and into the shipping package, but in saying that all the pieces where still there and in excellent shape so no complaints!!"
1,Seriously download codes?,DLC is download codes only not on disc. Those with lousy internet speeds or lack of hard drive space might want to avoid.
5,Only An Expansion Pack - Great For Those New to Xbox,"My son recently purchased an Xbox and this game.  He enjoys this game a lot.  Please note that this is an expansion pack game and will not be enjoyed by those that already have the original Lost Planet Extreme Condition game.  The bad reviews are due to the disappointment of gamers seeking a new and different game.  If you do not currently have the original Lost Planet game, you will most likely enjoy this one."
4,Short but of fun (for the over-and-over crowd)...,"Well there are plenty of reviews here already so not to rehash what everyone else has said, I will keep my review short and to the point.  Overall, I personally love this game as there is nothing else on the market that covers the action genre so much as this game does.  The graphics are excellent, no slow-down, detail is amazing etc.  The cons are as everyone else has said regarding forgetful story, bad voice-acting, short, etc.  I will say if you're looking for a deep adventure, look elsewhere.  This game is all action.  With that said, most of time the reason I read reviews is if it is worth spending the hard-earned funds to purchase the product.  The game is short.  I completed the game in a week on normal (about 7 hours).  Now here is where the meat is, re-playability. If you are the type of person that likes to complete games over on higher difficulties than you are in the right place.  I am attempting ""godly hard"" mode and am not able to pass the first section of the first level.  There is some real difficulty here and it is something I have not experienced since the days of 2-D gaming.  Beating this mode will give anyone serious bragging rights.  Also, after beating the game the first time, there are 6 challenge modes to complete that are fun and difficult at the same time (challenge 6....yikes!!).  This game should be played by everyone, no doubt about that.  Should this game be purchased at full price by everyone?  That's for you to decide.  Just know what you are getting is a great action game that bets on replaying.  No more, no less.  If you need an idea of what you are getting into action wise, think Bayonetta and Mad World (same great developer).  Now, how do I increase my gaming skill for this game on ""godly-hard""...."
1,It wasn't real,"I bought this game and you can tell it wasn't real based on the sticker being really obvious how bold Nintendo was, that there was no number imprinted on the game. Beware"
1,Don't Buy It!,"The Strap was fine for the first few weeks and then randomly got that weird hairline crack in the same spot as most people's have been breaking. I never write reviews, but this thing was 50 bucks and I'm disappointed at the poor quality. Otherwise, the design was sleek and it was comfortable to wear. Now I wasted 50 bucks and have to use the stock strap instead until someone else makes a better strap. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your money by getting this."
5,"Like Gran Turismo, but for the Switch!","I really liked Gear. Club Unlimited for the Nintendo Switch. You get to customize your cars any way you like from the tires, wheels, engine, gearbox and various cosmetic features over time by winning races and earning big prize money. You earn newer stations in your garage to customize various car features by earning higher levels from winning races. Plus all the cars are officially licensed models from domestic to high-end foreign models! And on top of that, as you increase your standing in the racing community, you unlock places all over Europe to compete in races ranging from on-road to off-road rally races! This is the type of racing game the Nintendo Switch needed! So far I haven't encountered any glitches or game ending freezes yet, which is very nice."
4,Almost Perfect,The only down side to this case is if you constantly take out your games the material that holds them in wears out so they fall out every time you open the case.  I wish they would make this but with pouches or snap ins (like the hori 24 case) options because then it would be perfect.
1,You either wants lights on or the sound but not both,"I have been gaming for 25 years. I bought these for my son. These are the worst designed headphones I have ever seen. In order for it to light up you must plug it into a usb port, but in order for you to hear audio you need to plug another cord in the audio jack. That's all fine if you have a set up with both ports 1 inch apart from eachother but if you intend to use them on a playstation, xbox, or nintendo switch the you can forget having them light up. Instead you will just have an extra cord dangling all over your hands which is very irritating. The microphone also is not adjustable and we have yet to actually get it to work regardless of gaming system. Lastly, they just are not comfortable. Trash. I would compare these to a 10 dollar set of headphones from a dollar general. Honestly, the dollar general headphones my son had before were better. I don't care what the reviews say. These are terrible. They afe probably ok and only ok if you use them on a computer where the ports are inherently close."
5,Great quality for the price!,"Great product for the money, very nice material and sound quality. They also fold so they are easily stored, or traveled with. Mic only picks up voice and not so much background noise. No static with wired controller."
1,A bit rubbish innit?,"Not worth it, it's faster for me to type out words on the on screen one rather than try to fiddle with this to get it to work"
1,One Star,Never pay over the official price. This is a rip off!!
1,Screen randomly blacks out during game play,"A recent firmware update has caused the Quest units to experience brief, intermittent blackouts in addition to tracking issues.  This is confirmed by hundreds of people on the reddit forums.  Oculus support is useless, since they do not publicly acknowledge that the problem is firmware related, and instead tell you to perform factory resets, do reboots, change play spaces, etc.  Rather than admit to the systemic problems, they prefer to waste the customer's time, adding to the frustration.  If they can iron out the glitches, then the device is worth consideration.  But for now, stay away."
1,Not multiplayer,Last time I pre order a game. Everything I read was it would be multiplayer. So I got a copy to play with my friend. This is not the type of game I find fun playing by yourself.  And still i see no where on here that says it's a single player. Maybe put a picture of what the back of the case looks like.
1,This is only access to a on line streaming network.,No. Just no. I was hoping for something I could have on the hard drive to play and past the time on flights and such. No such luck here. This is only a key code for an online streaming network. Very disappointed in Amazon for this. No happy at this at all.
1,Constantly drops connection(in wired mode),Thus controller was working great on my Samsung phone via wired connection until one day it started dropping the connection. It would lose connectivity every few minutes and now it just doesn't connect at all. It's a HUGE disappointment because this did work well for my games. I have tried troubleshooting the issue but nothing seems to work.
5,Great solution to tiny cartridges,"This Switch game storage case is perfect for keeping my growing game collection.  It holds up to 24 game cartridges and 2 microSD cards as designed but if you slid 2 games cartridges to each side you could get up to 28 games in this case. It also comes with a removable holder for 2 microSD cards. Games and cards clip into place nice and firm so there is no worry about anything falling out. The exterior is smooth and slides in and out of pockets with ease. Great buy, thoughtfully designed, no regrets."
5,LOVE!!!!,"I love the new chaos terminators, and this kit is well priced. It was exactly what it says it was."
5,its great,see I have the final mouse ultralight and this feels way lighter I love it reccomened
2,"Big hands your fine, average hands not so much",I really wanted these things to be an upgrade over the stock paddles but I feel like I have to reach to press the scuff paddles. Id say my hands are average size but my hands have been hurting using these. Unfortunately I might have to go back to the stock paddles.
5,Excellent Sniper game!,"If you like playing the role of sniper, this is an excellent game! It's crazy hard even at the ""normal"" level (for me at least) so I had to switch to the easy level. The enemies at the normal level seem to get alerted to you VERY easily no matter how long you take, how sneaky you are, or how quiet. Im sure as you ratchet the difficulty up, it's even worse (or better for those who like a challenge). The sniper animations when you place a great shot are wicked. The difficulty of making the shot depends on the difficulty level you are on from no calibrations to super-fine tuning and taking into account all variables (wind, distance, etc). I typically play just for fun so a super challenging experience isn't what Im looking for. I want recreation, not frustration. That being said, it seems as if this game caters to all types of players in the sense of how challenging you want the game. I'm glad I purchased it and after I complete the game on easy, I like it so much I may ratchet the difficulty up a notch and replay it. It's that cool."
5,Works great other products from this company are great too!,Great product and customer service.. the fan for the back of the PS5 that is also made by this company is great! I suggest you purchase that aswell..
5,portable switch dock,I was looking for a portable switch dock to make me play game on my 2nd floor because I do not want to use AC in my 3rd floor playroom this summer. This product makes me easily play switch in my computer display without moving anything from the playroom. I think I can take it when I am traveling because it is real portable and easy to use.
5,Great way to waste a lot of time.,"I love these games.  Each game is different and no matter how many times you play it, it is always a new game. I waste a lot of time playing this. I recommend it to anyone who is tired of shooting monsters.  It isn't as fast paced but infinitely more interesting and mentally engaging."
4,Call of Duty: MW3 for Wii,"I got MW3 for both my X-Box and my Wii.  The main difference between the two if the graphics resolution, which is expected.  As for everything else, I think that they are similar.  My boy and I really enjoy playing it on the Wii regardless of the graphics.  I would recommend the Wii copy even if you have the X-Box or PS3 version.  It is worth it."
4,Gourmet Chef:  Cook Your Way to Fame,"My daughter LOVED the Cooking Mama games (and actually learned alot of cooking terms playing same)  so since she has been trying to translate her Nintendo cooking skills into real life cooking skills, I bought her this game as it seemed more realistic.  It's good, and she does play with it, but not as much as Cooking Mama.  It's a bit more complex since there are stations where various tasks must be performed to get the plate out.  It's more like a restaurant instead of a kitchen."
5,Don't waste tour time looking for other Switch travel cases!,"I searched extensively for a bag that I thought I would be happy with. Thia bag does not disappoint! It is very versatile with removable velcro interior sectiona that can be situated however you want or removed entirely. I also appreciate the separate compartment just for the Switch. It accomodates the Swith even with a protective case installed. The velcro that secures the the top Switch case to the lower bag is super strong as well. Overall, I highly recommend this bag!"
5,Five Stars,Thank you sooooo match
5,8 memory cards in one,"So overall a big memory card for gamecube to store pretty much all your games but what u have to know there is a little button on the front which allows you to swap the between the 8 built in 128mb memory, so this is 8 memory cards in 1. the gamecube is limited to handle only 128mb so they put 8 128mb to make a 1 gb of storage. There is also 8 leds to let you know which of 8 you are currently on so only the one you are using will he lit"
5,Best console out!!,System is AMAZING!! Don't have any problems with it at all. The DS4 is a perfect fit in my hands and for me is the best controller of all time. Games are rendering in FULL 1080 HD. So far I can't complain at all. Great job SONY!!!
1,Trash,I hope your pillows stay hot and your house has an odor that you can't find the source of
1,Changed my life,"I rented this game for date night with a girl. I was about to score my first homerun. Then she saw the graphicd and said "" These graphics suck, hipster scum."" Then she threw a blue fireball into my stomach and i flew 40 feet, through my house, landing in my frog pond. I will die a virgin."
5,Greatest Star wars game in a decade,Fantastic and we'll thought out game.  This is a single player game and has no on line play.  Kudos to EA from keeping microtransactions out of the game.  Game is reminiscent of Force unleashed but with a way cooler storyline.
1,BF3 leaves MW3 in its rearview mirror,"Unless the powers that be reclaim the crown by returning to the COD4 days, Modern Warfare will continue to eat the dust of the Battlefield series. Why they continue to cater to little children that like to play arcade style games is beyond me. Let's hope the real FPS players reviews show that MW3 has returned to realistic combat and leaves the arcade games at the arcade. Otherwise, no sale from me!"
4,ok,"all right so the game is pretty good however it would have been good to know that the dlc is not on disk and you have to  download an almost 2 gig. patch and the almost 10 gigs of dlc, on disk would be better..."
1,Stick drift in 2days,"In sonys attempt to make a superb controller, it would seem that they made a problematic controller w all the haptic feedback stuff, stuffed in it. After just a few hours, left joystick would drift to the left. I even turn off excess haptic, does nothing to fix it, reboot it, nope. Unacceptable at this price for them not to fix,as there is lots of info regarding this."
5,Works As Expected,"Worked perfectly, just like OEM. No problems. Great price."
5,"Entertaining Game Series, Best Price","I own all of the Nancy Drew PC games and even though I'm an adult, I have a great time playing them (I pass them down to my nieces afterwards -- it helps having played the game for when they call and need help!). Secrets Can Kill is the first in the series and the only one that has an actual murder in it (the others focus on items being stolen, treasures hidden, ""ghosts"", and so on). ""Secrets"" is the weakest of the series but that's to be expected since it was the first and Her Interactive has made many improvements with each game. The game is point-and-click and the cursors change color and look when there's something of interest. Navigation is pretty easy, the graphics are rich and colorful, and some of the puzzles can be very challenging. In the earliest games you could choose between Master, Senior and Junior Detective but later games just offer Junior and Senior. Junior Detective mode gives Nancy a little book where she keeps track of what to do next, so kids can refer to it and not get too lost. The games became more educational with the titles of Dolphin Cove (you learn about dolphins, whales, nautical terms and flags, etc.) and Secret of the Scarlet Hand (all about the Mayan culture with settings in a museum). Some titles are just spooky fun like Haunted Mansion, Blackmoor Manor, Treasure in the Royal Tower and so on. The voice work on these games is good, but sometimes you can tell the actor is faking an accent. There's not a lot of animation, and the suspects usually stay in one spot so you know where to find them when you need them. I would recommend these games for preteens and up because some of the effects could scare a small child (in a couple of the games there is an explosion effect when you choose the wrong thing -- luckily there is always the ""Second Chance"" button, but the suddeness of the bang could make you jump if you don't know it's coming.) Overall, this series just keeps improving. I'm looking forward to the next one which will see Nancy in Paris, France."
1,Didnt work!!!!!!  Very unhappy...,By the time I realized it wasnt working I could no long return the item.  Very disappointed.  Wouldn't recommend it to anyone!
1,Can't trust it,So far I have found this game unplayable. None of my families will load anymore. I have heard of several others experiencing the same problem and I can't really believe EA Games would bring out a game that can be so unworkable.
5,Amazing... Can't imagine life without it after a year or so,Worth every penny!!!  Man I wish I would've reviewed this earlier... Once you get it and use it for a long time you won't wanna go back. I customized my eq for rainbow six to hear movement clearer. I am able to turn the knob to lower chatter while I listen for crucial sounds
5,I feel like a kid again,This console met my expectations perfectly. It ONLY has a couple games on it but that is fully disclosed. DEFINITLEY buy a tru blue expansion pack to make this console AMAZING!
1,USED HEADSET. Adapter not included.,"The description does not mention the fact that these are used headsets. When it arrived the box was already open and tampered with. Not only did it not include the adapter that was supposed to come with it, they actually put white duct tape on 3 parts of the box where it said the adapter was included to cover it up. I will post pictures of the duct tape half removed as proof. They refuse to give a refund. Please send me the adapter I was supposed to receive."
4,I don't like sports games but I love this game!,"I am not a fan of sports games - I don't like football, soccer, baseball, etc games on a game console.  However Nintendo has managed to make this particular game very fun to play.  It will be too ""arcady"" for real sports games fans, but for people who just want fun gameplay this is the game for you."
4,"Not Perfect, but its got a lot going","A couple of months ago, I received the Leap Motion, a motion controller for the MAC and PC that is able to detect both hands, along with all ten digits.  Think of Minority report with those super cool badass screens!  After initially receiving it, the first thing I did was search up a bunch of reviews as to how the device was to see if I might be disappointed.  At first, I was discouraged because for the most part, I only found reviews that either talked about it in a poor light, see words and phrases like ""underdeveloped"", ""just a toy"", and ""just not ready yet"".  However, I'm glad to say that I am quite pleased with my leap motion.  Although its not perfect, it has many functionalities that work very well with my computer and even though some apps and software work better than others, there is still a large amount of potential within the device, especially since this is only the beginning. Two apps that I typically use, would have to be Touchless for windows, basically a mouse and Gamewave, gesture related software that allows you to bind hotkeys and shortcuts to gestures from the device.  Touchless on the app store received many poor reviews, which I think is unfair because although the clicking mechanism need a little bit of work, I've found that it works very well as far as taking care of my needs.  Browsing the internet is very useful with it and it can only be developed to get better.  Gamewave adds a bit more of a sci-fi element to my computer, making task that I found annoying and nitpicky to be simplified when I need it.  One thing I have discovered with the device, which may also be a reason it received poor beginning reviews, is that it does require practice.  At first, it seems awkward, but I've found that many of the issue I initially had with the device went away as I used it.  My accuracy and gestures only continued to improve.  Also, one other asset I people need to understand is that the device itself is very accurate , its just a matter of how well the software is written, so it truly is only a matter of time until all of it is intuitive.  So overall, I am very happy with my leap motion and I'm excited for what's to come!"
1,One Star,Boring
5,Easy replacement regardless of XBox site discouraging!,"Happy to recommend this replacement part! At first I did not know what happen and a bit of research indicated that my power chord may have burned out, much like some computers in past. Sometimes 2-4 years is all you get with a power chord. Anyway, Xbox site suggested that only the official and much more expensive power chord would work. I took a chance on this one after reading some reviews and it restored my Xbox perfectly to happy functioning!"
1,Not worth it in the long run,"I'm sorry. If you're a gamer who's looking to be economical and go without the 3d, (because who uses it, anyway?) this is for you. But if you're going to be using it continually, i'd say the price is worth it for the new 3ds. I've had mine for a year. I was delicate with it. One day i turn it on to see that the screen is totally shot. Not worth it in the long run."
1,"Looked promising, but currently very buggy",Digital download version is plagued with crashes.  Cannot complete the objectives because the game repeatedly crashes to the Xbox One dashboard when transitioning between exercises.
4,Excellent device for boxing games,"Let me say from the start that the only reason I purchased this was to play the boxing games, like Wii sports boxing. Those who are avid players of these games are aware of how frustrating it can become when you're really into the game and find yourself limited in your motion by the two remotes being tethered so close together. I have not found this to be a problem with any other games that I've played so far, only with the boxing games. For this purpose I have found this device to be great! I love being able to make several right crosses or uppercuts without worrying about the nunchuck or the remote being pulled to the point of breaking one or the other. I have found this wireless nunchuck to be very responsive, well, at least AS responsive as the tethered nunchuck. Overall, this has definitely added to my enjoyment of the boxing games and I recommend it fully. Five stars for performance, four for battery life."
2,Least favorite zelda game,"I really could not get into this game.  Having a constant timer till gameover was way to stressful.  Additionally, the art and story telling is very dark and macabre and disturbed my children.  Finally, many of the minigames were more difficult because of poor controls than because of game difficulty.  I have now tried all of the zelda games and this was the only one I didn't like nor finish.  I know it has a rabid fan base, but it was not for me with constant timers and starting over."
5,Great substitute,"My original WII controller died after many years and this one is easy to sync with original box.  I was a little skeptical, but gave it a try and am very happy."
1,Blocks you from the game if you don't log on frequently enough.,"This game uses Denuvo which, in its essence, blocks you from your game if you don't log on every few days. It doesn't care why you couldn't log on, you could've lost power, been in the hospital or on vacation, it'll block you either way from something that you paid for. That ruined the game for me and I got my money back."
5,80's Baby game!!!!,I so love it ! I play Super Mario everyday!!!
5,Great Addition to An Xbox 360 Arcade,"This item is a great addition to anyone's Xbox 360 Arcade.  The price is set nice and low considering the amount of content that it comes packaged with.  This package includes a newly factory refurbished 20GB HDD for your Xbox360.  This is a decent size, it has plenty of room to store your games' saves as well as downloadable content and Arcade games.  This starter pack also contains an Xbox 360 headset and 3 months of free Xbox Live Gold.  This is the perfect way to transition into the full 360 experience and all at a great price.  The added benefit of having a hard-drive is that the drive contains emulators which allow you to run original Xbox titles that you may have missed out on.  For the price of the starter kit, and the contents that it contains, you simply cannot go wrong purchasing this nice addition to your system.  I highly recommend it."
5,Find the Relic!,"I originally bought this game for my sister for her birthday ( I preordered it!)  But she never played it.  So, I started playing it and found myself hooked on this game!  The storyline is so awesome and the characters are terrific!  Play as Princess Mint, the magic-wielding girl who lost her right to the throne of the East Heaven Kingdom to her little sister and find the relic so she can regain her title!  Or, play as Rue, the young boy who lost his best friend, Claire, to a monster.  Use his ability to schange into defeated monsters to help him get the relic so he can bring Claire back.  Fight Belle and Duke, the treasure hunters, and battle Rod the Blade Star (and his best pal, Johnny Wolf!) and his mighty weapons!  This game is incredible!  The best part is, after you beat both games (you have to sit through the credits and save the game at the prompts EVERY TIME), you can play again with the same powers as you had when you finished the last time! You can even play BOTH scenarios at the SAME TIME once you beat both!  GET THIS GAME!"
5,The designed hand grips are awesome. Definitely a controller you want,This remote is far superior over the original. The designed hand grips are awesome. Definitely a controller you want
2,"Fun, but very blurry and hard to adjust.","I wear glasses so that could be contributing to my problem, but I've tried the Oculus and didnt encounter the issue. The text and games are pretty blurry when trying to play. I did the eye measure setting, but still it was incorrect. I was unable to get it clear and it started giving me headaches unfortunately."
5,Must have camera lens protector for iPhone 13 pro max!,"Buying such an expensive phone it bothers me that my phone case just the phone and not my camera lenses which is most important thing for my phone. I never knew that lens protectors do exist until I found Ferilinso protector. It came with 3 in the pack, and it looks very cool. I have to say it is easy to install, takes less time and the quality is amazing."
4,Could be the surprise game of the year.,"This game has the potential to be the surprise game of the year.  It has the potential to be what all of us wanted Zelda to be on the gamecube but will not be because of the extremely childish graphics.  This game has amazing graphics, it is made specificly for the X box to show off its graphical capabilities.  Someone said the characters looked like they had a low polygon count, like many this person had no idea what they were talking about.  The main character is constructed from 7000 polygons, there are no loading screens because of the hard drive, the story should be deep and immersive and should not completely bore adults out there.  On several other sites it has also been mentioned that the game promises 75 hours of gameplay, a total that will rival even final fantasy.  This game has the potential to be one of the greatest ever and looks like it might just be the best action adventure game of the year and should blow zelda out of the water.  I give this a definate 4 stars with the posibility of a 5 or even going off the charts."
4,Just like on the computer,"I haven't played Sim City in years, but this version on the Wii is not that different.  The menus are the same.  Zooming in and out on the large tv makes for some interesting scenes.  The flights over the city are kind of lame.  It also takes a while to get use to using the wii remote to scroll through the city - less control than with a mouse. Still hours of fun watching your city grow and then destroying it."
1,Started Smoking,"Mouse started smoking when i plugged it into my usb hub and it burnt out my Razer keyboard, my usb hub, the mouse that came with the kit (which started smoking), and a usb drive. The Keyboard works but I would not call it a ""gaming keyboard."" The headphones work like a cheap pair of head phones. You get what you pay for I guess."
5,Good Budget Horror Game :),"I love the attention to detail. This is a good horror game with a good story. Very immersive sound and dark spooky locations. Very Impressive. If you like old survivor horror games, this is the game for you :)"
5,Amazing.,"This is the best quality controller I have ever used, and I have used them all. It feels extraordinary comfortable and controls perfectly. Takes the Switch to a whole new level. Nintendo needs to take note."
5,Sound quality,Quality of item was superb. Ever so grand packaging. Speedy to send. Seller is fine and superlative.
5,Awesome,Holds 8 UMD disks comfortably and is officially licensed by Sony. The zipper and case is well made. The zipper has a clip on it and the side has an exterior pouch for anything else like memory sticks or whatnot. This combined with the Logitech or Sony PSP hard cases makes for a nice PSP set up.
5,Dynasty Warriors 5: Review 1!!!!,"I have found the KOEI dynasty games to be lots of fun. mostly because of there simplistic design. But even for a fan, I must say after so many games, that look the same, it gets repetitve. I mean there are at least twenty Dynasty games now, so why buy this one?, because it's the best. More enemies, smarter AI, more weapons, huge levels, and the biggest amount of playable characters ever. If you love dynasty games, pick it up at a retailer, if you've never played one, this is the version worth checking out. Anyways I give dynasty Warriors 5 a fun factor of: 10 and overall a: 5  ""Never judge a game until you play it"". quote by Kevin."
1,Extremely Disappointed,"Very briefly, I pre-ordered this game and when it arrived I couldn't wait to install it and start playing, then I realized it was a Steam game, I have other games that use Steam and lets just say that I am not a fan. But after loading I jumped right in and came crashing to a halt, my core 2 duo, 2GB ram laptop was unable to run the game in the normal map mode, I can only run the game in the low res strategic mode and then it crashes on me. I realize that it's my video card limitations that that are probably the root cause, but still it made for a disappointing purchase."
5,If you like Harvest Moon.,"There is a well designed story in this game, starts a bit slow if you get distracted by the many mundane tasks that I love about Harvest Moon.  Purple monkey dishwasher.  Do people read amazon reviews of games?  I mean, if your here, odds are you have already decided to buy the game.  I was on a road trip and had to go to drop one really bad, I'm talking prairie dog.  So we stopped at this gas station and I run inside to look for the bathroom, after a quick scan I ask the attendant urgently about the location of the flapper, he hands me a key and informs me it is outside.  The initial shock of horror had to be pushed through as I hustle outside and around the corner of the building, we all know what kind of hole these restrooms are like.  The key doesn't work in the door, so I try and turn the nob, the door nob, it doesn't turn but the door opens anyways.  The first site upon entering is water running from the base of the toilet to drain on the floor where wet toilet paper was huddled inside.  Normally one would run in fear at the site of this bathroom with the yellow stained sink, broken tile and filthy floor, but my mission was urgent and there was no looking back.  I expertly navigate the wet spot and unidentified matter on the floor to get to my last hope of relief.  Reach into the paper dispenser hoping to cover the seat for my own well being only to pull out the last three remaining squares, which would have to be saved for a future purpose.  Drop trou, spin around, sit and see on closed door, written in feces, large and bold with exclamation marks... ""STEVE!!!"""
5,Wake up if you call yourself serious gamer,"Frankly speaking, the whole world is just so mislead by the hype PS2 and even the XBox had created for themselves. However, the GameCube is the console most underated in the market. In terms of graphics, GC can provide stunning graphics that both PS2 and XBox cannot offer. People were so mislead by all the specs publication wars which actually Nintendo was not interested in at all. Look at games like Metroid Prime, Wave Racer, Red Squaldron etc. you will know what GC can offer. However, the whole world is just to distracted by graphics of games, which in way thought that as long as the game as good graphics, it is a good game, which is SO SO NOT TRUE. A game is about game play, and this is what makes a game re-visitable or not. Among all the game libraries provided by different consoles, there is no doubt that PS2 has the biggest library but at the same has the most junk games available. For XBox, most stuff are port from PS2 and at the same time has pathetic games like DOA Beach Volley which encourage players to be obssessed with the virtual body and manipulation of CG girls. For Nintendo, you can find the most innovative games in store: Eternal Darkness redefine the way survival thriller should be played, Metroid Prime redefine the game play of the series per se, Animal Crossing provides the most interesting interactive expereinces, Zelda Wind Waker provides you the most environmental related RPG format, Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles provides innovative Multiplayer RPG experience. People should give GC a go before criticising GC as a kid console. Just imagine games like PN03, Killer 7, Eternal Darkness and Viewtiful Joe are not kid games at all. So wake up gamers and try before you criticise, and play before you make your judgement of this console of all time."
1,Lost Kingdom is IMPOSSIBLE,Stuck at one part which is impossible to even get through.
5,Runs on Vista and Windows 7!,"No need to say more than this is an excellent electronic version of the classic board game. Just wanted to let folks know that it runs just fine on Vista, and happily, Windows 7 too. Whew!"
4,Not charging when connected to PC,Overall the cable is great except the fact I can't charge and play while it's connected on my PC to play steamVR games. It will charge your quest if connected to wall port and will let you play PC games on your quest but will not charge while doing so unless you play with Airlink and have it connected to the wallport but I can't do that since it's laggy for me. Overall good product but if your looking for a cable to charge while playing SteamVR games on your quest this might not be the one.
1,ARRGH!!!,When i got his controller today It looked promising but i plugged it in and started to play Ninja Gaiden ........ only to figure out that the only button that worked was the B button.
4,"A warning, just in case you are not sure...","These games do NOT work with Windows XP.  Most people reading this are probably aware of that, but in case you thought about purchasing it and hoping you'd luck out (like my wife) it doesn't."
2,Not Worth it,"The knobs gets stuck so everything gets delayed in my tv, it sort of takes 3-4 seconds for the tv to capture its very annoying, NOT WORTH THE MONEY."
5,I love it,Excelent
5,My son loves it!,Purchased for my son. He loves it. Noise cancellation is amazing we keep asking him to clean his room and he just keeps playing and gaming. Sound quality had to be good because sometimes he appears to be drooling while playing Roblox. If you buy this your kids will enjoy it but you may need to purchase a taser along side the headset. This way the kid knows when to clean their room. I find if you get them all in a room and tase the biggest one first the rest get the hint.
5,Nice headphones at a great price!,"My daughter loves these headphones. Great quality, great price, great seller. Great for guys or gals. The headband is super sturdy. Looking for better than name brand headphones? These last longer, trust me i had some high dollar ones last half as long!"
5,So Far So Good,"I like this case so far, it had a nice fit. Definitely hard to put on but I got it after a bit so no biggie. I like that the handles are thick for better grip."
2,"Good, but no tournament mode!","Better graphics and physics, but not having offline tournament mode is really annoying and hard to overlook.  This is how my friends and I always play when we get together.  I hope they have a good reason, this leaves a pretty bad taste in my mouth."
5,The best mmo I've played,"I wasn't expecting much out of this game. Then I was a couple of gameplay videos. It looked like fun so I took a chance. This game is awesome. The combat is great. it feels a lot like the other elder scrolls games', but mixed with an mmo. it's not pefect as it just launched, but it blows wow, twtor and tera out of the water in terms of enjoyment. So far, knock on wood, the community is decent enough. I'm only at level 8 and taking my time questing. I think people who rush through to get to 50 are really missing out. There are some great story-line's and voice-acting here. I've already convinced three other people to buy the game. The subscription fee is necessary, in my opinion, to keep the game thriving. If it was f2p, I wouldn't even bother played it. You get what you pay for."
1,This game is pure garbage. When i started playing,"This game is pure garbage. When i started playing, CPS wanted to take my kids because they said i shouldnt put them through that kind of mental anguish. Do not buy! Can we please get The Show on xbox."
5,Works with easy set up!,Works with easy set up!
1,Defective software !!! Please read !!!,"Warning! Do not buy this game! I love Qbert arcade game so I bought this game. Yes this game did not have any problems after installing it on my PC. However, after playing a few rounds, the game would stop for no reason, then game over title shows up. The original Qbert game does have 9 levels, but this game does not reach to that level. Instead after reaching the 2nd or 3rd level, the game would stop and reset, then show the message saying game over. I am an expert on the original Qbert arcade game that was out many years ago. I did pass all 9 levels scoring over 1 million points with over 30 lives, so I am not junk playing Qbert."
5,Five Stars,It's Pokemon what can I say? The shipping was fast.
5,Buy It.,"Literally the best Final Fantasy game ever. Combine The Witcher 3, The Last of Us, Batman Arkham Series and GTA V and you got the style of Final Fantasy XV!!! It's also very pretty, and the map is seamless and enormous! Also, you have the option to select several different subtitles and voice overs in different languages. I have Japanese voices with English subtitles because that's what I prefer. There's even options to use fast combat or a wait mode combat that slows down so you can pick the way you want to attack. So this is great for new and old Final Fantasy fans!"
5,Fun times,"Works great as expected. This was a replacement for an old fat 360 and I must say I like this smaller, sleeker design much more. This particular system only has 4GB of space, so you will want some extra storage (hard drive, external hard drive or USB flash drive)."
4,great fun for kids and adults I suspect foul play on negative reviews,"I bought this for my niece and after purchasing it for almost 60 bucks for her and reading the online reviews I got nervous. Dont be the game looks stunning in hd and the disney world is incredible the camera is clunky but it is nothing major like the reviews make it its a ton of fun and really will give you a nostaligic good feeling even the adults, I had no complaints from the kids and the adults in the room all had  a blast. If your getting sick of these bs propaganda games like black ops call of duty and want something simpler for the kids or the kid at heart check it out its refreshing and old fashin fun.. mabey the developers didnt pay enough for a great review it doesnt add up a ton of work went in to it and it looks fantastic! nitpicking at its finest"
5,Great System,"The guy above is in troll mode,first off you don't have to pay for Ps plus.You have to look at it as a rental service with perks,i uses Ps plus for the auto updates and cloud saving.It is a awesome service if you want to get the most out of Psn."
5,came quickly and worked perfectly,My 10 year old son is devastated when his mic does not work.  With a little help from youtube we were able to replace this port and did not have to buy a new controller.  I was the best mom ever for about 30 min until I told him it was time to turn off the x box for the night.
1,EA's Copy Protections Hurts Legitimate Users,"I purchased MySims on Amazon for my son to use on his netbook computer.  After several months, I have not been able to successfully install the game onto his computer due to the SecureROM copy protection 'feature'.  I have contacted EA customer support.  They started with a cut-and-paste response that didn't answer my question and then summarily closed my ticket without answering my question.  The sad thing is that these schemes don't really stop pirates--it just angers legitimate users who pay for their programs.  I don't plan on purchasing another EA title."
1,Sim City Destroyed,"Sim City was a great game.  I don't like reviews that combine the tech side of a game with the play side, but in this case, it is warranted.  The DRM and always online stupidity directly impacts the play in a very negative way.  I've asked Amazon for a refund.  Shame on you EA!"
1,NO IN GAME CONTENT LIKE PROMISED,The game itself is perfectly fine. My problem is I paid for the early tip off so I could have 5000 VC and the other perks that came with the early tip off and it was never given to me when I downloaded the game and it should've been there immediately. Hoping it will somehow show up.
5,"Great product, fast shipping! Zero complaints here!!!","I love how easy this was to set up. I purchased a different, pricier brand a few years back and it is not as good as this charger! It's easier to use, just drop it in the cradle and done! My older unit took a lot of finagling with the controllers before they charged. So many times I was left with a partially (low) or over charged (hot) controller that it would ruin my gaming experience! Not any more with this charger and batteries! I highly recommend this item, you will not be disappointed!"
2,This drive is way too clicky,"I've worked with computers for over 40 years and with hard drives going back to when they were 5 MB in size (and still many times bigger than this drive.)  Clicky drives are usually pointing to a problem.  Now WD is trying to answer with pointers to things on their websites, but those pointers do not really relate to the kinds of sounds that many of us have noted in our reviews.  This drive scares me.  I will not put anything on it that I don't have a copy on another piece of media."
1,WASTE OF MONEY,This CAME BROKEN! They made it almost impossible to return so much that it was easier to just cut losses. DO NOT BUY! it came with the wires ripped and sticking out of the head phone. Junk and the worst purchase i ever made....
5,Don't wait on nintendo. Buy this.,This thing is amazing. Works perfectly. Don't even bother wasting anymore time hunting down the official Nintendo version. I got sick of waiting for new stock from Nintendo so I took a chance on this. So glad I did. I see zero lag and I am using my old wave bird.  Just had 4 people playing like the good old days.
1,Occasional double-clicking when single clicking after 6 months,"I absolutely love this mouse when it works. It's got a nice feel to it, and I love being able to interchange the side buttons to fit my needs. However, after 6 months of use, I noticed it would sometimes double-click when I single-clicked. And also, when I try to drag and drop something, it quits in the middle and then reselects something else along the way since I was still completing the dragging movement. A temporary ""fix"" is that I tried to blow under the mouse button to hopefully remove dust or anything that could have potentially gotten in there, but the problem would just happen again a few minutes later. I don't want to have to take this mouse apart since the rest of it works perfectly, but with this problem, the mouse will soon become unusable."
2,"headache, buy the actual gift card","I failed to read the fine print that this was a digital purchase, but decided it was fine... that was until I had to figure out how to find my code and then how to redeem it on the Xbox.  After hours of my time... I will never purchase a digital version again.  Big headache"
5,Great travel charger,"The price drove me to this charger and I have to say it is worth it. It can charge the switch while playing, and I have not had any issues with durability. If you are looking for a cheap travel charger, then look no more."
5,Awesome replacement!,"This was an easy install (first time install, took me just under an hour). It is incredibly quiet in comparison to the old fan, and I have not had any overheating issues since replacing this fan, along with cleaning and reapplying thermal paste."
1,This product did not come as advertised. It said ...,This product did not come as advertised. It said that it was the Udraw tablet and what I received was the Udraw studio game only no tablet. I'm in the process of returning it.
2,disappointment again for Nancy Drew fans,"Her Interactive started the Nancy Drew computer game series with wonderful, complicated, and fun games such as ""Treasure in the Royal Tower"" and ""Secret of the Scarlet Hand"" and ""Danger on Deception Island"". Now the games are too easy, too short, and the characters completely forgetable. This game has a promising start, but there are virtually no puzzles to solve--- only repetitive tasks. The ending is one of the worst. Her Interactive needs to remember that it is the story, characters, and puzzles that will keep fans purchasing its games. Like ""Danger by Design"", this was a waste of my money."
5,Works with Xbox 360 kinect for full body tracking!,"I bought this to try out full body tracking with the kinect I had hanging around, works as well as people said."
1,...,Codes dont work both preorder bonus and skarlet skin
1,Sketchy at best,"After install when I run single player it keeps asking for me to insert the CD in the drive. The CD is IN the Drive.  Even has a laser printed label on the wrapper that asks customers to please contact them before returning.  Apparently it is a recurring issue, enough so that they include this label.  Walk away."
1,Buy BattleFIELD instead...just imagine the Star Wars noises.,Boring repetitive and unimaginative gameplay...what a let down.
5,Must have to your Nintendo Switch!,"This is must have for any Nintendo Switch owner.  It's a Real Time Strategy game that is lots of fun. Command large armies of cute ant like creatures called pikmin that help you gather fruit, battle creatures solve clever puzzles and more! Best of all you can even play with another friend on the couch via local co op! Even all the downloadable content from the wii u version is packed in.  Also 3 levels of difficulty for any challenge palette (hardest has to be unlocked by beating hard difficulty).  So whether you're a casual fan or looking for a hard core challenge pikmin 3 deluxe delivers.  Enjoy the beautiful scenery, gather the fruit ( which looks like you could pluck it from the screen) and enjoy the adventure! A definite must have!"
5,The Best Next Gen Racer,"This is, without a doubt, the best 'next gen' racing game released on either console. The graphics are gorgeous, the races are fun and plentiful and that 60fps is buttery smooth. There's a ton of cars in this game and the variety of tracks is nice. The addition of weather is welcomed and really impacts the game and affects how you race. You hit a puddle at 200 mph and your done. It's not dynamic weather like Driveclub (which is amazing) but it's impressive. If you own an Xbox One and love racing games, this is the game to get."
4,If you liked the movie you'll love the game,"Unlike most movie based games, this one you play through episodes of the Bolt TV show that is briefly shown in the movie. Instead of interactively reliving the movie like most movie based games. The Bolt levels are fun and full of over the top bolt combat. The Penny based levels are stealthy and have fun puzzles to solve. The kids will love it, I thought it was really fun and am waiting for the kids to be done with it so I can play."
1,Beware of warehouse deals...,"This was ridiculous.  The warehouse deal was a piece of crap.  The description was completley innacurate!  The item we recieved looked like it came out of the bottom of a box from a garage sale.  No product box, no anything.  Just a dirty scratched up console and a dirty scratched up controller.  Someone had to have been using this at a frat house for years. Cannot believe Amazon would be so deceptive.  I hope this is not a new trend in warehouse deals.  Very dissapointed and what a waste of time.  Be warned if looking at warehouse deals.  So now we are waiting for a return label to return this and watch amazon try to sell it to someone else.  Not o.k."
1,One Star,Scam. Don't buy.
1,Tnx for the heads up on the DRM,"Thanks to the earlier reviewers who posted warnings about the DRM.  I was just about to buy this, but I'll go get a DVD or something instead."
1,One Star,This a cheap no name brand !! False advertising!!
2,Might work for certain games but...,"I bought these specifically to use with FIFA 14 as my thumbs were slipping off the new PS4 sticks more easily than the PS3 due to the new slicker finish on the rubber.  Also, I heard nightmare stories about the surface ripping off the PS4 sticks more easily than PS3 and, with no less than 3 PS3 controllers sitting on my shelf with shredded thumbsticks due to hours of FIFA play, I figured these would be a good investment.  During my first session of gaming after they arrived the left stick cover actually flew off the stick while I was making some pretty intense moves and rolled under my entertainment center never to be seen again.  At least I think that's where it went because it's nowhere to be found.  My friend kept using his but eventually took them off as well as they kept popping off in his hands while playing.  In fairness the grip is good and did help with the thumb slipping issue, especially when your hands get sweaty, but it's not much good if they don't stay on.  They may work for other games like shooters etc but I'm not a console FPS player so I couldn't say.  For FIFA there is just way too much torque being applied to the stick during games for them to be effective.  You would really need something with a locking attachment, not just rubber flipped over the stick."
5,Perfect. Don't buy any other brand.,"Sure, it's my first day of use, but slipping this puppy on my Switch instantly made my day. It's thick enough for protection, yet it doesn't add bulk. Most importantly, it makes holding the Switch so much more comfortable. It's cheaper than the competition, but it seems like it's better than the competition: it comes in a nice box, feels like good quality, and it doesn't cover up any buttons--not even the shoulder buttons."
5,Should've been released in US,"Surprised this wasn't released in the states.  I bought it because everyone says the ps4 is region free and it would work for the American version.  They were right.  It's everything it says it is.  Works fine,  and you have a hard copy of the dlc.  Everything I could want.  And obviously the game is amazing,  but that goes without saying"
1,One Star,ITS a FAKE nintendo. So be aware some games WILL NOT PLAY!
5,Well worth it,I bought these a while back being a little skeptical about them considering they are a lot cheaper than what I paid for them somewhere else and honestly I can't tell the difference between the 2. Well worth it
1,"Fun, but bugs are ruining enjoyment","My son was really excited to get this game last Friday. Unfortunately, his enjoyment has been tempered by the extreme bugginess of the release. Since he made it to the 6th year, the game has crashed constantly. We finally called customer service this morning and were informed that it has been recalled. We will be sent a new disk in the mail. I am happy with how WB has handled the issue, but if I were in the market to buy the game, I'd hold off until it's clear that the new release is less buggy."
5,Solved my forehead pain problem!,The stock strap caused pressure on my forehead that eventually led to a headache after 30 or less of game play. THIS BAND SOLVED THAT PROBLEM! It's not the rolls royce of VR gear but it'll do and it is SUCH an improvement from the stock strap! Get one!
1,Fake reviews!!! Buyer beware,Was going to purchase this until I realized all the reviews are FAKE.
1,Rent--not a buy,"I bought this because I believed it was going to be a Hot Pursuit--it's not. If you have the original Hot Pursuit--you don't need this as the original is better. There are two modes only: Online and Career. You can not play with other people unless you use the online version. You can't just start a race of running from the cops (like the original), and the lack of playing against others in your own living room kill this game. I regret wasting my money on this game--had I rented this before buying, I wouldn't own it now."
5,Duhh!!!! it's a must have.,"Best deal as of rn, so it's a must buy. Unless of course, you haven't played the last of us or want to reply it. Tbh, I personally liked that headphone and figured that it was a greater value than that last of us. Anyway your call :)) This is the best xmas gift :DD"
1,One Star,what a garbage ripoff of metal gear. this is the farthest thing from metal gear. don't waste your money!
5,Saved by codebreaker and Skiller!,"My life kinda sucks.  I have a dead-end job even though I graduated valedictorian from college.  I've never been lucky in love or good at making friends.  I think about killing myself at least once a day.  The only thing that keeps me going is art, looking forward to the next great horror movie or ultraviolent videogame.  I loved manhunt the original and had been looking forward to a sequel ever since I beat it.  I went to BestBuy on Halloween, paid my 29.99, and took what I expected to be an orgy of bloody beauty home with me.  When I put it in and performed my first execution, however, I couldn't believe my eyes.  What's with all this artistic bullspit, the bluriness and black and white and pixelation; I can't tell what the heck's even happening.  I kept playing, hoping it would get better.  I thought maybe once I injected myself with the drug Leo said would clear my head I would get to see the executions clearly.  No such luck.  So I went online to Amazon and read what other people were saying.  CENSORED!?  How?  What?  Rockstar would never do that, would they?  Not the people who gave us GTA and Manhunt.  Say it ain't so.  But it was so.  And so I thought, well, that's it.  Time to run a bath and take the blade out of my box cutter from work.  I figured I'd leave a note detailing how censorship led me to do myself in.  I could see the news story.  ""A young man in Ohio killed himself when he discovered that the controversial videogame, Manhunt 2, was censored by its publisher.  This senseless tragedy is causing many to wonder whether video games are violent enough.  Several parent groups are demanding that Rockstar games release the original, uncensored version of the game for fear that others may be driven to suicide by the disappointment.""  I figured if my death could change the world, it would be greater than anything I could probably achieve in my life.  But then I saw the post where someone was talking about a code that would uncensor it and something called codebreaker.  I did some research and discovered that there was in fact such a product and code.  I praised god, turned off the bath water, put my box cutter back together, and placed my order for codebreaker.  It's three business days later now and I'm finally enjoying manhunt2 in all it's beautifully gory glory.  Praise be to codebreaker and Skiller for saving my life."
1,Buyer Beware,Buyer Beware: Right trigger button sticks
5,Perfect :D,Great condition! Thanks ! Came on time and included everything!
5,Five Stars,Love this game
5,"Brilliant, good looking, and functional","But more about me later... Seriously though, this was exactly what I didn't know I needed until I used it. The pairing was easy, I use it with a pair of Jabra 65t Elite (make sure you use an APTx compatible device for no lag). I have had no issues playing hours of Octopath traveler except that I have to stop playing to recharge my earbuds :D Also, I love that it color matches my Switch controllers. I posted this on FB and several of my friends are super interested in getting one! I did experience slight lag with my Bose QC 35 II but they are not LL"
4,Works,"But the downside is that you have to turn it ON every time. To turn it on is very easy, no buttons, laser sensor detect your finger. If you play 1080p games... this item is not necessary.  But if you like to play at 4k, this is a must.  You gotta take care of the air flow, as this console only top fan is too slow (for my liking)"
5,"Very fast delivery, easy to use","Just to throw in my two cents: Some people mentioned that it took them as long as 20-30 minutes to receive their digital eShop code. However, I got an email with the Nintendo eShop code within seconds after completing the Amazon checkout. Code worked (of course) and it was very easy to use. Five stars!"
4,Budget!,I'm addicted to dungeon crawlers so I'm enjoying this. Shame about some of the designs and how bland the dungeons are though.
1,This game is not ready,"I didn't actually buy this game directly off of amazon, however I did buy my beautiful gtx 760 off amazon which came with a code for this game.  Every part of this that involved amazon worked perfectly. Everything else was terrible. Getting my code and getting my game downloaded and ready to play were both nightmares. Uplay is a nightmare. Then I wasnt even able to play this game until 3 days after its release date because the Ubisoft servers were crashed. Then when I finally did start playing everything was actually going pretty well, the graphics looked nice, except one thing... My character didnt have a head. It was funny at first in the cut scene, but then his head still didnt show up in gameplay.  Even his shadows in gameplay and cutscene didnt include a head.  After a few minutes I rage quit, probably wont even finish this game because it is so far terrible and I got it for free thank god. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME."
4,A real treat for RPG gamers,"As the PS1 releases get more and more shallow, it's good to see that this new compilation of early Final Fantasy games made it here from overseas.  Final Fantasy Origins collects the original 8 bit NES Final Fantasy game, and Final Fantasy 2, both of which are brought to the PS1 as Wonderswan (an obscure handheld Japanese system) remakes of the original games.  Older RPG players who loved the challenging gameplay of these games will instantly play for a nostalgia trip, but younger RPG players who are more used to Final Fantasy VII or easier and flashier RPG's won't find much to like here.  The first game is a basic by the numbers RPG that is quite challenging and long on gameplay, but the second game is much much better and features great character development and storyline depth.  The graphics are nicely drawn and colorful, reminiscent of early Super Nintendo-esque graphic quality, but the sound and audio really aren't anything special.  As with any RPG the controls take getting used to, but are easy to handle after a while.  Origins also plays more smoothly than the earlier released Final Fantasy Anthology and Final Fantasy Chronicles; it has much faster loading times and no slowdown whatsoever like the aforementioned games.  All in all, I strongly suggest picking up Final Fantasy Origins, especially if your an older RPG player."
1,Warning : EA Games has Closed these Servers,"EA Games  decided to close out the game on Setpember 22, 2004 so it can no longer be played. Please keep this in mind when purchasing this game."
5,"New challenges 100s of new details, not as good of graphics","Nintendo decided to skip Super Mario 3, and go for 96 level Super Mario World, in the second installment of Mario on Gameboy Advance. The game starts with a new intro of Mario, Luigi and Peach out in a hot air balloon, where Mario and Luigi go off flying with their caps, when they return, the Princess has disappeared! For those of you who have played Super Mario World for the Super Nintendo, nothing big has changed, but there are 100s of details which have improved, which most people would never notice, such as the ability to save anywhere (because this is portable), more sound effects like the voices of Mario and Luigi and also hold 999 lives! An amazing new feature is the colored Yoshi's! Once you find a colored Yoshi in the hidden Special World, you can find them everywhere at random. The graphics however are not as bold and bright as Super Mario World, instead they are light and dull. The sound really is not up to par with the original game either. There are new controls as well, such as the jump and run are still the A and B buttons, but now the spin jump is the R button. There are also new intros and finishes to the game. Like Super Mario Advance, there are several new challenges, such as there are now 350 dragon coins in the game, get them all, and see a little scene where Princess Peach turns them into Princess coins. For every 1 million points you earn a star is added to the start screen. Silly little challenges that will keep people working for years to come."
5,This game will hold your hand for the first time ...,"This game will hold your hand for the first time you encounter any new mechanic, after which it knows you didn't read it so it kicks you down the hill and laughs as you struggle and die repeatedly until you finally work out the mechanics, build, and strategy you actually need."
5,Don't Listen to That Ghey Reviewer.,"There is a reason this was the first hit game for both Xbox 360 and the PS3 in Japan, it's fun!  Fans of both Dynasty Warriors and Gundam will love the mechanics of fighting off hordes of enemy mechs, while retaining the DW mechanics that have made the series so popular.  The number of enemies on-screen is amazing, and the sharp graphics do the Gundam universe proud.  Don't believe that 12 year-old boy who I'm sure hasn't even played this game yet and just wants to see his review on Amazon.  If you like hack and slash games, or beautiful mech designs, do yourself a favor and pick this one up, you might even find it used somewhere."
5,Love the game but...,"I brought this game and tried to download it on my new computer with windows 8, and it wouldn't download. So I had to pay for a game that I couldn't have. Fair, NO WAY. I contacted Amazon about this for a refund, and they wouldn't do anything to make it right. Even after I have brought 3 Kindle readers and many books from them. From now on all I will buy from Amazon will be the books for my kindle. They did give me a link to contact, but it did no good still couldn't download the game. So I went to Fred Meyers Store and brought the game, as I should have done in the first place instead of trusting a download from Amazon.If Amazon is having issues with the company they gave me the link to finish the download then they should work out the issues with them, and refund or give us credit towards perhaps a book for our kindle? Instead of just blaming it on another company. What a headache. I spent all of Thanksgiving day trying to cook and download this game....at least the dinner came out well :)"
5,Best gaming keyboard,This keyboard and mouse is amazing. I have bought several in the for my son to use for gaming and this one by far is the best. The buttons are high quality and the mouse is very accurate. It has great lights built into the keyboard. Is definitely buy this again.
4,A fun way to spend an hour and exercise your mind,This software was easy to install.  The Terms and Conditions of Use are very clearly stated.  I found the choice of difficulty levels greatly enhanced the product and challenged me.  The puzzles are fun and the techniques required to play are easily understood. My one wish is that there were more varied games included.... But it is a lot of fun and is definitley challenging...
4,"But even better, it has an sd slot so that if ...","I grew up with the Atari 2600 and so finding this portable flashback console was really a pleasure.  With 70 games to play many of my favorites were included.  But even better, it has an sd slot so that if you have additional 2600 rom images, you can add more games.  I have an actual 2600 with hundreds of cartridges, so I was able to expand the original 70 with a few hundred more, now having all my favorite 2600 games in a convenient pocket size that I can take anywhere.  The games play well and I have not run into any bad issues with them.  The screen is a little small, but 2600 graphics were never high res, so the small screen still works quite well.  The reason I am subtracting a star is that it is built from pretty cheap plastic and the control is not as good as I would like it to be, making some games hard to control.  All in all, if you grew up with the Atari 2600 like I did, then you will enjoy the ability to take your favorite 2600 games everywhere you go.  I added several pictures of games that I loaded onto my SD card.  For those who do not recognize the games in my pictures, they are: Venture, Donkey Kong, Crazy Climber, Robotron, Space Invaders, and Moon Patrol."
2,"The game is good, but the crushed package makes me feel like ...","When I receive the game, the package is totally crushed during the delivery process. The game is good, but the crushed package makes me feel like it's a second hand game, although it's brand new."
4,Crazy Game With Some Problems Though,"Im a big fan of fps games and wanted something different.I havnt played an RTS game in 5 years mainly because the controls were hard.I got hooked on this game since the demo and with the voice command its so much fun and simple to play. However here are some things to consider: This game is gonna take 5 gigs of your hard drive space for install so you might have to erase some stuff. Also,some times it doesnt pic up my voice commands clearly and sends units to the wrong places which has costed me some games.It might be because Im using a bluetooth headpiece which pics up sound from around me if its not quit. Also this game seems to skip a lot or has even frozen my ps3.Thats why I stopped playing on PC beacause with games installed on the HD it would do this and fps games dont really store much on the HD. Overall I love this game and the problems only happen once in a while. You can always rent it first to try it out."
4,"It's okay, it works","I recommend using this when you are not using your Xbox. I plugged a dead battery pack in it, and it was green within 5 minutes (obviously not fully charged) and when I was finished gaming, they stayed red. Not sure if mine is just faulty, or if the product is cheap. I do still recommend it, as it gives your Xbox a sort of bionic look to it, and you do not have to worry about plugging in a charging station, as it plugs and feeds power from your Xbox's USB port. Yes, it has a USB port on the front so that you still have one. I do agree that the batteries are a slight pain to get in and out of the controller. There is a little tab on the batteries that slide into the track thing on the right side of the controller, so watch out and make sure that you're putting it in correctly, because I didn't lol...also when putting the batteries into the charging cradle, make sure the sticker is facing to the left, otherwise they do not clip down in there...I about had a fit thinking mine was broken until I turned the batteries around and they clipped right in there. The pics I posted are showing the track thing in the controller and the tab on the battery pack I was talking about."
1,"The game itself is way too expensive, not to ...","The game itself is way too expensive, not to mention all the extra money they expect you to spend after buying the game."
4,Hooked,This game was purchased by my wife. She is the only one that plays it and it must be good because she is hooked on it. Like Spider and hearts it is an easy game and a lot less stressful than some others we play. She finds Gems and Jewels challenging but not too mind taxing.
1,Very Frustrating Game Play,"I love playing Scrabble, but the version for the DS has very poor gameplay.  It likes to just drop the tile in a random location or pulls the tile back to your tray.  It sometimes takes up to 5 trys to get a tile in the right position."
5,AWESOME!,This is the long awaited title that will give people reason to go out and purchase the Wii U.  Simply beautiful.
5,Awesome,These stickers are great. They don't fall off at all. They are so cute and add the perfect touch to my iPhone.
1,???'s experience,I'll have to agree with the majority here. This game is not that much fun. There is really no relation to Michael Jackson other than his songs being used. I was spoiled playing the Wii version. Woe is me.
1,If you want to ruin your Christmas - buy this,"Everything is true. This game should never have been released at this moment. If you buy it as a gift - be warned"" You will ruin your Christmas because of all the frustration an hours of troubleshooting just to realize - it will not run. Not on your top-notch pc. And no help to get from Rockstar. Don't buy."
2,Difficult to learn,"I really love the look of this game and the music. The problem is that it is very difficult to learn. Dance Central has ""Break it Down"" mode which makes it playable even for uncoordinated people like me. If there was a way to slow down or learn the moves in a different mode this game would get 4 or 5 stars. But, otherwise the moves are too fast and complicated for me. :("
1,Straight trash....,What the f is going on... This game is horrible... No defense... Trash offense.... Horrible... Zero stars.... Don't buy...
5,Best Xbox One headset for the price!,"This is definitely my recommendation if you're looking for a Xbox One headset. The sound quality is phenomenal, the wireless works perfectly with zero static or lag(UPDATE THE FIRMWARE FIRST!!!),the controls are easy to find, and the mic work flawlessly. The super human hearing is pretty cool, albeit more of a gimmick in my opinion. It does amplify things like foot steps and distant gunfire, but nothing game changing. My only criticism for this headset is the same one I have of all Turtle Beach's; it could be more comfortable for the price bracket. The ear cups are firm, yet still comfortable. However, I find I have to adjust the headband ever thirty minutes or so. I will add that I do have a big head. If you have a normal person sized head, I would imagine they would be much more comfortable for longer gaming sessions."
2,Poor quality!!,"It does charge good. Poor quality. But, after 2 months of use I noticed that it started to melt around my controllers charging port just where the connector goes. Maybe after leaving it charging overnight every other day or so."
5,A MUST HAVE!!!,"Easily one of the top games this year if not this gen, if you are a rpg fan."
5,This game is great fun for 4-15 year olds.,"LEGO video games are very entertaining.  We have several.  They have great graphics, are easy to learn and fun to play so they are perfect for young children.  Our 4 year old plays this game by himself, absolutely no help is needed.  Our 12 year old also plays this game and loves it.  For the older kids, there is an optional ""character design"" mode which allows players to design there own super villain and so this adds an element which is of interest and more fun for older children.  The ""character design"" mode is an optional part of the game so the younger child does not have to do this in order to ""just play the game,"" again our 4 year old plays this game by himself.  All of the characters are LEGO characters and, as the game progresses, they do hit each other, they punch and kick.  There is no blood when a LEGO character hits another character.  The LEGO characters just fall apart into individual LEGO pieces.  The game is rated appropriately and it is great fun for kids.  I am glad I bought it."
1,This game requires a STEAM account!,"Civ V might be a good game, but the required STEAM account makes it not worth the effort and money!"
5,Love this game great addition to lego game collection.,I finally got the game after having to get it somewhere other than off Amazon due to a problem with ordering using 2 day then having it lost in transit then having it show back up after I'd all ready been refunded and it was rerouted back to Amazon and no way to get it any sooner than 2-4 weeks due to them being out of the game. ....anyway...after all that and getting it somewhere else. The game is great. I haven't experienced any glitches as others have. We collect the lego games and this was for my daughters birthday. She LOVES it. She likes creating new dinosaurs and I've been playing it as well as have my husband and her brother. I like that it has all 4 movies in it. (I haven't watched Jurassic World yet but am set to go see it soon and am a fan of the entire series both books and movies.
1,Best use is for gaming,"Product worked as advertised, but did not work for my needs.  Customer support is non-existent.  I am still waiting for my refund after almost three months since returning it the same week I bought it."
5,This is the future of exercise equipment. You will want to exercise.,This is a wonderful way to exercise. You are having so much fun playing the games you do not realize how much exercising you put in until you stop and feel the workout. For us elderly types that don't want to leave the house you can not do better then this.  The product is sturdy so you feel safe using it with the VR headset. The bike monitors your heart rate and other statistics and you can monitor that in game. You can even see how you rank with other folks playing the same games. I was surprised when they sent me my first weekly summary of how I did for the week. I know I will continue to exercise with this product when I haven't with the other exercise equipment. Well worth the money.
5,Nice carrying case.,"Carrying case is what you expect by for steak controller. Nice design very solid too, I was really not expecting that. Came in a simple presentation but overall a great case. Inside the made some cut outs if I can say so. you can easily place your cable and wireless adapter that came with the controller not the case ( just to clarify ) and also some battery slots which was good or I think it was for the batteries but whatever it works lol. I'll show some pics so ya can see! Overall sweet case"
5,Demo shows promise,"This game hasn't been released yet! However, the demo that's availiable for free from the playstation store is amazing. The controls are vey tight and the graphics are a sight to behold. The demo is only about 10 mins long depending on how qudkly you can pick up the controls. Lots of fun combos do make this game a lot of fun. I recently bought a HDTV and the colors and graphics really reach out and grab you on it. I'm very excited about this game. The actual release should be this September."
4,BAVARIAN CASTLE,"Great fun!  The only problem was the patch that I didn't know about.  Long hours doing the last level and I only got the gold key, not the platinum.  I had to start all over after getting the patch installed."
1,Realistic But Boring,"EA's most recent update makes NHL 13 a very realistic game as it pertains to the current NHL season.  You can play as either the Owners or Players.  You make contract proposals to the opposing side which are immediately rejected.  There is no actual gameplay currently in NHL 13.  The recent update does add ""Bettman Mode"" which enables you to cancel any games you might have thought about playing.  ""Bettman Mode"" also allows you to actually destroy the game.  High marks for realism, but low marks for fun."
5,This does work for a PS5,"I was most worried about the reviews that said it wouldn't work for a PS5, but read plenty that said it did. I hooked it up to the system and at first it said hard drive not recognized and I though oh crap, they were right. I went into system settings, went into the external hard drive itself and simply had to click on reformat to PS5. It took like a min and I was able to move all my PS4 games over to it. They will play from it to the system and everything. It will save the PS5 games but you can't play them from it, but you can store them and simply move them back to the system whenever you want them. I have 12 games on there and one of those is final fantasy XV which is a huge game and I've not even used a TB yet. This does work for PS5 so don't return when you first hook it up and it doesn't recognize it, simple setup and restructure to make it work!"
1,Just awful,"I have a fairly decent computer (which exceeds the system requirements), have almost all graphical options turned off and the frame rates are still horrible.  The menu system is much worse than NWN.  I played it for about an hour and was just so disgusted with the control and the frame rates that I quit playing.  I downloaded the patch and it didn't help performance at all."
5,"I played this game from the sun down, to ...","I played this game from the sun down, to the sun up back in the 90's. I lost the CD while moving and I had the urge to play it again after 20 years. An icon game, no match with another one. Got me a refurbished xp and it was all worth it. This game is ALL CLASS AROUND !!"
4,"A great, but now rare, addition to my collection!","The cryptocurrency rumors have recently been debunked so it is safe to use!!!! I really enjoy the game and it has a great amount of content for the price. However it has been pulled due to a legal battle, so snag it now!"
5,My nerves are shot!,I wasn't prepared for how scary this game was gonna be. Great game to play solo or with an audience.
1,Damaged And Broken,"Unpacked the package. Looked at the product box, it was damaged but that's forgivable because it is stated in the description. Upon opening the product I saw it was broken and tried hooking it up to my switch and it didn't even work at all. Would not recommend buying off the Amazon Warehouse Deals"
5,Nothing like Destiny. It's The Division,"Yes the online only sucks but I have to admit this game is fun. Me and my friends easily spent hours playing the beta and had a blast. The Dark Zone is very fun even though I was a bit skeptical. Nice size map, can play solo without other players on map."
5,Great looking and durable case!,"This case has exceeded my expectations, especially for such an affordable price. I was first surprised to feel how smooth the material on the back is. The pictures made it look somewhat textured, which I was totally ok with, but pleased to feel how soft it actually is. I've had this case on for over 5 months and it has held up so incredibly well. No thread pulls, the leather back holds up well and wears nicely, and the buttons along the side offer high quality clicks and feel super sturdy. I've been very satisfied with this case and have received numerous compliments on its looks. It's also surprisingly slim, which I adore. If you like the look of this case, don't hesitate in buying yourself one- you won't be disappointed."
2,Great city landscape. Doesn't work well with Switch controllers. Game steps tedious to perform,"Since it's a LEGO game, thought it's something can be handled by a younger kid. The city landscape is beautiful and it's obviously a lot of efforts have been put in to create all the features and hidden treasures. However, the game may be not tuned for Nintendo Switch controllers? There is a lot of hit-and-miss in terms of how you move the joystick and how the character, and especially the cars, move. It is really unnecessary difficult to control those motions. And some of the required steps to go through to continue the story, just tedious for tedious sake, not adding values at all."
2,Not the correct size for Switch Lite,It seems they just took a generic mobile phone screen protector and slapped switch light on it. The screen protector is slightly smaller than it needs to be. I notice it any time I look at my Switch Lite and it is bothering me. I'm going to wait a week and see if any other tempered glass screen protector gets a good review.
5,"Great, NOT DOA","If you guys think your keyboard is DOA, Make sure you push in the mini USB really hard. You'll hear it click. I thought mine was DOA and tried that and it worked. WEEEEE I'm happy now."
1,not what I wanted,"this is a junk gun it feels cheap and mine came with scratches and missing parts, I had already returned this for a refund"
2,I wish there were more stories,"I got this game the first day it came out. I have been playing the sims ever since the 1st sims game. Its really not worth the 40 dollar price tag for only 2 stories. After you are finshed with the stories, you then get to play in classic mode, witch is just the same as the oringal sims. If I were you, I would save my money and just go buy Seasons when it come out later this month."
5,Space Marines really are the Emperors vengeance,"To Start off I will say that I know there will be 200 people on here posting reviews that this is a Gears of War clone.  Space Marine plays similar to Gears but with some BIG differences.  Number one the Lore and History of the Warhammer 40k universe is huge and it has also been around for around 30 years so it already has a pretty sweet backstory.  Secondly the whole cover system is gone which personally to me is a great edition because it seems like in all shooters you do the same thing. Step one: move into room  Step two: take cover behind something  Step three: kill everything Step four: go back to step one.  Space marine has you hold the line until your enemies are all over you then pull out your power sword and go to work melee style.  The Story seems more interesting to someone who enjoyed Dawn of War or someone who enjoys the books.  If your not familiar with 40k the story will probaby be really boring and it uses terms only fans would recognize such as Astartes, Adeptus and Xenos.  All in all I think this game is great, mainly because i'm a really big fan.  My advice to non-fans is to go play Dawn of War 2 or read the ultra-marines books and then come back to this.  The game will be a lot more fun."
1,WORST COD YET!!!,"This is the worst COD yet, i hate the game SO much all the drop shots, the health is super inconstant sometimes taking only  2 shots to taking 10, i was playing when i got spawn killed 7 times before living for over a second. Its BAAAD dont buy it save your money and get BF4 its WAAAAAAAAAAAY better then this peice of crap! I got it has a download so i cant even sell the peice of crap, SCEW YOU Infinity Ward go back to MW2."
1,Playstation 5,This ps5 is junk it constantly freezes when I play games.Thankyou for ripping me off I won't make that stupid mistake ever again
5,Tired of changing out batteries?,"then this charging station is for you.  We've had this for about 2 years and it's worked out beautifully.  It comes with the rechargeable batteries and has a backing that you change out for the original peices so you won't accidentaly charge any extra wii-motes that aren't rechargeable.  Better yet, it gives your kids a place to store the wii-motes."
2,"I never play campaign, so this is strictly for ...","I never play campaign, so this is strictly for the multiplayer game modes. I've decided I'm not buying another Call of Duty until they make it less futuristic. I miss World at War and the first two modern warfares."
5,Best Game Ever,My 11 year old son and his father have been spending a lot of time with this game.  My son wanted it so he could work on cars like his daddy.  To see the smile on my boys face as he works on the cars and learns about them and is able to show his dad what he can do makes this game totally worth it
5,Finally!!!!,"The end to the epic Saga has arrived. I've been a fan for years and waiting for this game to come out felt like an eternity. The game features incredible nice and clean graphics and the boss battles are still just as epic as ever. Plus as a bonus I received my order ahead of time and yes I did receive the preorder bonuses like the DLC packs regarding boruto and Sarad as well as Naruto and Sasuke The last with Sakura, Hinata, and Kakashi (Hokage Outfit) plus 2 free months of shonen jump which I did not know where included. Whether you've been a Naruto fan for years or are barley starting to dip your hands into the Naruto Universe this a perfect game for either type of player, fans will love the cut scenes and epic boss battles that retale the story like never before. Overall the game is a perfect conclusion to Naruto's tale."
5,Another winner for Pop Cap!,"This is a beautiful hidden object game.  There are 25 levels to get through.  At the end of each level you solve puzzles, which will give you what you need to ultimately solve the game.  I have played this game through twice now, and each time the hidden objects that you have to find change.  This gives the game good replay value.  I would recommend this game for any hidden object fan."
5,Best game. Ever!,Since the game is free to play I think buying points is the perfect way to appreciate the outstanding work GGG has done here.
1,I am really upset with this purchase... ...,I am really upset with this purchase... I bought it thinking I would have a code to type in and there is nothing... So pissed right now. I want my money back or give me my code..
1,Death of a formerly great game,"I have played this game for two years, since the first day it was released.  I cancelled both of my subscriptions today.  Sony has completely removed the ability for my characters to progress in this game by releasing an 'upgrade' that was clearly not tested well enough.  It is full of bugs, nothing works correctly anymore.  But even those are forgivable sins.  The biggest problem with this game is Sony's unwillingness to discuss franky the status of the game with their customers.  I have played this game for over 2 years and have defended them at every controversy.  This game may be salvagable and may even end up being playable and fun, but I will not be there to see it, and I recommend spending your money on Matrix Online, or Guildwars over this game."
1,Just terrible!,"Boring story, boring gameplay, boring characters, inconsequential choices, terrible dialogue and lots of technical problems...  political correctness overflow.. (I.e. Out of the 6 characters that you can romance..  3 are bisexual, 2 are gay and 1 is straight..  wtf?!?!).  buyer beware!"
5,Do not trust the negative reviews.,"I read some of the reviews before making this purchase and was almost led astray to believe that this was a poor quality remake of the original Sega Genesis and that ATGames should be ashamed for releasing this console. Those people are spoiled. This is awesome and me and fiance play this console frequently as we came up in the age of Sega and Nintendo and instantly reminded how fun and simple games used to be. Awesome also because she isn't to familiar with how to play the new generation consoles due to their complex controls. Game night just became more interesting with this new addition. Annnnd you can purchase retro game cartridges to play on the console as well. The new 2018 model with the SD Card slot makes it easy download and play any Sega rom file. Ignored the negative feedback about the wireless controllers because they work perfectly fine. Take my word, this console is legit."
4,There's a lot of hate circulating for this game due to poor animation quality,"There's a lot of hate circulating for this game due to poor animation quality, but there's much more to this game. The combat is fluid, exploration vast, and cast lovable. In short, this game does have some short falls compared to all the hype, but this a must for fans of the series."
4,bring it a round town!,"HI my name is Andrew and I am 12 years old (I love the sponge bob show)I really like this game. when you wake up from bed you are sponge bob. then you can get up on the wrong side of the bed or the right side of your bed. when you choose a side it will have a different task if you get up on the wrong side of the bed you will not be able to find gary! then you will see a tape recorder it will start palying And plankton stole gary! so on the tape plank ton will want you to give himsome stuff or he will not give you back gary. so once you finish one taskthere will be another recorder and he will give you some thing else to do. and after you finished all the tasks he will give you gary. if you get up on the right side of the bed. you have to warn mr.krabs about plaktons robo krabs! and so you have to help you friends along the way so you can get to the real mr.krabs and tell him about robo krabs. the only thing that I did not like about this game is if you get up on the right side or the wrong side you will have to do the same thing like on the wrong side of the bed you have to get your drivers permit, get jelly fish jelly,get cheese off hooks, help mr.krabs get rid of pirates, and get a krabby patty (it is not as easy and it sounds) and on the right side of the game you basicly have to do the same thing. theonly difference is that you drive a different car, when you jelly fish you can be sandy, when you get a krabby patty you are robo krabs, and when you get the cheese you are patrick, but it is the same thing when you have to get rid of the pirates that is the resson I gave it 4 stars. well you are most likely geting bord so bye."
2,Very dirty. Buttons stick. Not solid black.,"The remote I received had a grey bottom and buttons rather that the full black I was expecting. The buttons all show obvious wear. It is very dirty under the joysticks and the A button with is the most important sticks. In an attempt to unstsick the button I stuck my nail in the cravas and scraped a lot of gunk out, however the button continues to stick. The controller does however seem to work for the time being. I haven't put it to use beyond an overnight netflix marathon. So my opinion still has plenty of time to worsen."
5,EXACTLY what i needed.,love it! my favorite case i have for my Switch. (: it's light and durable as well. does dock to the tv but you have to take the joy con covers off for it to fit the joy con holder. but they are easy to remove!! highly recommend.
1,Possible counterfeit,"The game is fine but amazon sent me a foreign copy,with a cheaper case insert and a little card saying it was from a foreign distributor and not from Nintendo. Real classy,Amazon."
1,Poor durability design,"Though this headset had exceptional sound but that quality is overshadowed if the headset doesn't last.  I have this headset over a year and only used it for 2 month all together on my PC and PS3. The side part of the headset is very fragile, I don't know what made the designers think that part of the headset would last with a thin piece of plastic supporting the area where all the pressure are at when putting in used. I've checked all the bad reviews here on amazon and the pictures they provided, I was not surprised the area that broke on their headsets are similar to mine. Stay away from this headset and get something else."
1,Dont buy,One of the worst Street Fighters graphics the  roster is very short the game has server problems
5,Soooo cute.,"This Yarn Yoshi is to die for. I love him so much. I want to have dinner with him, sleep with him, take him absolutely everywhere I go. It is NOT PLASTIC. It is a knitted made or yarn Yoshi. He is adorable and delightful in every way and you need him in your life. He is waiting to be your new best friend. Buy him immediately for he is cold and sad in a box and needs your companionship. I would buy every single last Yarn Yoshi if I could. Unfortunately, I cannot. So please help! Buy him today and give yet another adorable Yoshi a forever home."
5,Very happy with this purchase,"I'm very happy with this steering wheel stand.  The main portion of the stand is already put together and just needs to be unfolded.  The pieces that need to be assembled are the platform for the wheel and the shifter (which we didn't put on).  The bolts and holes lined up for the Thrustmaster wheel and pedals.  Kids were very happy.  The stand is much more stable than the folding table we had it attached to before.  The pedal platform has a ratchet adjustment for the tilt.  The wheel height  is adjusted by simple pressure screws (no holes to align).  I was willing to pay a little more for this stand after reading the reviews of other stands with missing bolts, misaligned holes etc."
5,Family Team Work.,"My kids are 14, 12, and 6.  We played it for the first time tonight for several hours.  We had to quit because it was getting late.  I think this is the first game I've found that we can all play together and have fun.  It was really enjoyable to fail at a level and hear my kids, who normally get along like cats and dogs, work out a strategy to improve.  I only wish they worked together this way in the real kitchen!  We all seemed to take on certain rolls.  I was the cook, my older son the chopper, my daughter handled customer service, and my 6 year old son was the dish washer.  Now the levels are getting more challenging and forcing us to be more flexible."
5,WOW!,"When I heard the Gamecube would be getting a wireless controller I really had my doubts that it would work well. When I got home and plugged it in, those doubts were ended. The controller's shape is slightly different than the normal one due to the fact that there is a battery slot, but the weight and feel of it in your hands is virtually identical to that of the normal controller. I can lean back on my bed, halfway across the bedroom from my system, and it STILL works! I've even pointed it backwards and put objects in front of the sensor, and each time it works just fine. There are only two problems. Problem one is the lack of a built-in rumble feature. This isn't a big problem though, in that it was left out to save battery power. Without that feature, the controller lasts up to 100 hours (and I doubt I've even played my Gamecube that long since I got it!) You can also change the frequency so that you can use any combination of Wavebird controllers or the standard cord using ones. Problem two is the lack of color variety (to date this controller is available only in gray.) But that doesn't disrupt gameplay so it's not a big deal either. If you've got a Gamecube and a quality game like Super Smash Bros. Melee or Star Wars Rogue Leader, the Wavebird is all you need to make your gaming experience complete."
5,Perfect,Love the product the colors are great
5,"Easy to hold, comfortable..set up not too difficult","Nice controller, fun to look at and very functional"
1,UBISOFT just doesn't get it,"DRM ruins games. UBISOFT ruins games. this isn't worth purchasing. You must have an active internet connection at all times in order to play an offline game. Wireless internet? forget about it. Until UBISOFT realizes just how wrong they are, this game deserves nothing but 1 star reviews."
1,Not fun.,Pay to win.
1,BUY ONE GET ONE FREE IS A LIE,"This was supposed to be Buy One Get One free, I only got one. NOT AS ADVERTISED!"
1,Arrive cracked being packaging was smash up,Looks like it would be a nice protector but it came in all smash up and both tempered glass crack and was missing one of the touch screen protector. Little upset cause usually skinomi are great but this one would be rated 0.
2,I'm soo sad!,Honestly I'm a huge fan of all the COD. I cant even explain the countless hours of COD I've spent playing these games.  Read the reviews your self because I don't even want to explain how sad and disappointed I am with MW3. I just wanted to come in here and give my ratings. Hands down the best COD was MW1 and Black Ops. Sorry Fanboys but I am entitled to my own opinion!
5,"The guy that said you don't need all of it, is CORRECT","I just used the little contact discs inside of these to replace the ones in mine.  Be careful though.  Worked great, tested on Call of Duty BO4"
4,"Fun, different, quirky","Not a typical shoot 'em up, really liked the quirky back story that was slowly revealed throughout play.  You have different paths you can go down, so you can end up with a different story.  It won't be my favorite game, but it is certainly an unusual and fun game to play through.  Bought it used, so didn't pay list price.  Graphics are quite good with a high end card and lots of RAM.  Sound is great.  A well designed game."
1,Not true to the simcity line at all,"It still has traffic bugs, city get corrupted and you lose them since you can't save them to your own pc.  Months later and they try to release DLC for a charge... when they haven't even fixed the game so it plays good.  I try to play it since I paid for but it wasn't worth the time to just see it all lost because of server issues."
1,It's a Beta fighting game,"I agree with most of the other harsh reviews on here. This game was released pre-maturely and clearly was rushed. It's been several months and some of the basic functions have yet to be released. This is a perfect example on how, not to release a game. Capcom...you lost mega-man, let's not compromise the integrity of Street Fighter."
5,Great Product!,"Just as simple as it seems!  Remember if you are trying to go quite a distance, your USB cable needs to be less than 15' total or else you risk losing signal.  So a 15' cable with a 4' printer cable (for example) would ut you at 19' and it probably wont work correctly. Thanks!"
5,You will have no life,"once you begin to play this game. The graphics are amazing, the gameplay engrossing. Seriously addictive. The only drawback is that you have to have a pretty powerful computer to play it. Even though my machine exceeds all recommendations for this game, it still crashes to the desktop on a fairly regular basis, and it took some serious tweaking to get it to run in the first place."
1,Pass,Lets send a message to the developers that we don't accept what they have given us.  Don't buy.  Stay away and maybe they will fix it for the next version.  Simply pathetic.
1,Advertised for the wrong camera,"Not for the playstation camera shown in the picture, it's for the original ps4 camera not the vr one."

5,Make sure it's what you want...,"Battlecruiser Millennium is a specialist game in the sense that you have to want to play it for it to be enjoyable.  You start by choosing your name, sex, race, profession, asset (based on profession), gear (based on profession) and then go.  Professions include star fighter pilot, capital spaceship commander, and marine.  If you are a fighter pilot, you choose your fighter; if you are a capital ship commander, you choose your battlecruiser or carrier; you get the idea.  There are campaigns that give you some structured missions but most go for the Roam option.  Once you complete a campaign you revert to Roam in fact.  The beauty of the game is that you are limited by your imagination.  I say this because if you are a carrier commander you can jump into a fighter while your AI crew fights your carrier and attack your enemies in the fighter, land and jump into a shuttle and pick up some wreckage of your vanquished foe, pilot that shuttle to a planet, drive off the shuttle in your ground assault vehicle, head towards an enemy base where you dismount and lead your team of marines in for the final assault.  Or you can do all this from the comfort of your command chair in your star ship with your red shirted ensign having all the fun.  Or just fire your missiles from space (if you can afford them) and destroy the base that way.  You are limited by your imagination and understanding of the controls.  Yes, there are a lot of controls, but given everything you can do, what do you expect?  Right now you will probably want to play as a fighting (military, police force, insurgent, etc) profession (caste) but with the multiplayer traders and others will be in high demand.  You trade some graphics for gameplay, but are you playing the game to look at the graphic or are you playing the game to immerse yourself into a game where the sky is the limit?  The graphics look good and certainly add to the feel that your marine in space is tiny compared to your ship compared to the starbase, compared to a planet...  If this is the kind of game you want, you will love Battlecruiser more and more as you figure out how to play - because it will take you awhile.  If you ever wanted to command a starship, pilot a fighter and shuttlecraft, drive a planetary vehicle and lead a team of marines all at the same time, this the game for you."
1,Watch out- terrible customer service and old broken drives,This is the worst experience I have had internet shopping. I am surprised that Amazon tolerates a vendor that misrepresents it's products and refuses to refund my money after repeated requests. The DVD drive is stated to be new yet it arrived in very used and worn out condition. The Drive door will not open and it sounds like the parts are grinding when it spins. The vendor has tried to blackmail me into removing my comments in order to replace the broken drive. Avoid Excess Source if you can.
1,Absolutely do not buy,"Absolutely do not buy this piece of trash. Within three wearings, the second hand had broken off and was simply rattling around inside the watch. Very cheaply made. It's true, you get what you pay for."
1,"The game WAS good, but they've gone and Killed it","SWG was the greatest MMORPG I had ever played at first, but not so any more. First, The creators of the game Ignored what the Public wanted. Then, when they showed us what they were planning to do to the game, they ignored the public outcry. And finnaly, when they forced it upon us, they ignored and forcefully suppressed the screams of horror. The Creators of the game have destroyed the features that made SWG stand out and be special and replaced them with a nonfunctional unplayable combat system. Don't buy this game, you'll be wasting your money."
1,The 3rd one and the one for Sega Saturn were my two favorite. I wasn't expecting this to give me that ...,"I was a huge fan of Road Rash. The 3rd one and the one for Sega Saturn were my two favorite. I wasn't expecting this to give me that same experience, but I hope I would get that feeling. The controls are really stiff, the graphics look from early last generation. There was more free roam then actual racing. (I don't like everything going towards free roam) I want like the old games, select a country (track) and race with the story tied around that and after you beat the game or a separate  mode have free roam with mini quests that people who like that can do. That is what this seemed like free roam with just mini quests. There were so many glitches with my body stretching all over the screen and I got to a point where I can't even load the mission. The game freezes then crashes. Tried it on my other PS4 same thing. I don't think I've done a review on here, and I haven't played a game so bad that I had to until this one. The amount of disappointment is unreal."
5,awesome,had to get a USB - C type cable with it because the one ac adapter for the switch didnt work. but other than that the product is amazing!! Lonnggg battery life and feels great in your hands
5,Well worth it,"Great console! I was a little nervous about getting this after some of the issues I had with 360, but it was obvious right away that this console was a much higher quality in both hardware and software. It runs quiet and doesn't overheat after hours of playing. Voice commands work a lot better then I expected and it's light years better then the original kinect! At first the user interface was daunting, but after playing around a little, I got the hang of it. I feel like with all it has to offer, I will use it all the time even when I'm not gaming!"
5,Awesomeness!,The console got here extremely fast. It works better than my original nintendo (which broke) and it's a lot smaller too. Overall pleased
5,"Targets, gold bricks, swims, laser, and great for smashing for studs!","This was our first additional purchase outside of the three that come with the game, and he's great! With him we can use the targets, swim underwater, blast with his laser, shoot gold bricks, and smashing up stuff in his cyborg suit is super easy. Like everything else, whether or not he's good for you depends on what other characters you have. We love playing him."
1,Completely Outrageous!,"My 7 year old son absolutely loves playing Skylanders and we have purchased every new game, countless characters for both XBOX and Nintendo DS. Kaos is on his most wanted list at this time but who in their right mind would pay this kind of money for one character. Shame on you for taking advantage of children this way!!!"
1,Terrible,This game is nothing like what you expect...you expect it to be some-what like the WII game and it's horrible. Recommended not to purchase.
1,insultingly incomplete,"Breaks cannon, massive plot holes, incomplete game. While this is the final chapter in one of my most cherished series, there is very little that remains after a botched ending that can be considered good."
4,Great for the price,"For the price, you could do alot worse. Quick and responsive. The buttons on the back work great. Don't chuck it, it won't survive"
5,Inexpensive way to customize your elite controller,Inexpensive and it come with two sets and the tools. Looks great
5,"So, so good","I haven't played a latest-gen racer in awhile, and I have to say I'm blown away not only by the graphics, but also the quality of gameplay. While there are some minor annoyances (aggressively rubber-banding AI), this game gets most things right and it's a joy to cruise around the seamless open world."
5,Great Game,"This is a great game.  Some people was disappointed with the motion controls, but it is still a good game.  You can swing the remote like a lightsaber, even through  some reviews said you can't you.  The biggest problem people had was the characters don't swing the way you swing.  You swing left he swings left.  You swing right he swings left.  What you have to remember is that they still swing the way they did in the old games.  You think of that you will enjoy the motion controls and the game."
4,A sea adventure.,"This game is a lot of fun, I highly recommend it, especially suited for the whole family. My grandchildren and I played it and we found  it is a great adventure; not violent like a lot of the pc games nowadays."
5,EverQuest is just that!,"Cut to the chase...EQ is a game unlike no other. Asheron's Call is zoneless, yes, and you  can have larger parties, yes, but EQ is more of a roleplaying game than the others. It does not allow player killing unless  you agree to be one (which you can do at any time). It gives spells real  names - rather than Heal Song One for instance, a bard sings Hymn of  Restoration. Rather than speed, a shaman cast Spirit of the Wolf (SoW). It  is this type of verassimilitude within the genre that make EQ great. In  addition the world is huge. I have been playing for three months now and  have only really explored four zones out of 70 some odd - though I have  been to about 10 others. Each zone is unique, and exploring the EQ world  reveals stunning vistas and new enemies to be dealt with. The early going  is a bit tedious, but by level 7 the game becomes rivetting. You will have  forged friendships with other characters and will regularly use your  friends list to see if they are online and ready to group with you on  another quest. You will also continue to make friends by your actions and  words in the EQ world, and as they start exploring they will invariably  invite you along to share the adventure. Finally, let me mention the  updates. EQ is regularly updated and they actually listen to the players  when they make changes. And changes are not to allow players to advance  faster - rather they are to increase the pleasure of the gaming experience.  They even run a test server that any EQ player can log onto and experience  potential updates that might occur on the main servers themselves. Also, in  March comes out the add-on which launches a new continent in the south and  a new race of lizard-like creatures with their own unique abilities. It  also promises improved graphics (and believe me, the graphics are already  stunning) and game handling. So...if you want to purchase an on-line  multi-user massive world game, EverQuest is the one for you."
1,Very dissapoonted. Not worth the money,"Very disappointed in this battery pack. Doesn't hold a charge at all. I have to keep my controller pluged in all the time or it will shut off.. i bought this for the sole purpose of not buying any more AA batterys, I can have my controller plugged in without any batterys battery and it works better than this battery pack. I dont know if I got a faulty battery or what, but it sucks. I'm giving a 1 star because it won't let me do no stars."
4,Disapointing,"I'm a huge Civ fan been playing since the '90s.... I was hoping for something as fun as Civ Revolution was on the PS3, boy was I disappointed. I'm looking for functional play such as scrolling from city to city with the L1-R1 buttons, nope not an option. I don't like the building of encampments, campus's, entertainment district."
1,I should have read the reviews,I paid good money for this game and I can't play it. Every time I try to play it I just get a black screen and no game. I tried installing and re-installing it with no luck. I am so upset I can't see straight. So now I have to go thru the hassle of sending the thing back. UBISOFT sucks!
1,Only worked for 10 mins,This was bought for a birthday gift. It worked for.10 mins and then gave the red ring of death. Tried to get ahold of the seller and never was called back. We returned it to Amazon.
5,the best headset ever!?!?,Honesty this might be the best gaming headset for the cheap the it is hands down the best and nothing to it. The only down side to this is that idk if its just me or something but the amplifier you get sometimes mess with the sound like I would be playing a game in 7.1 surround sound and it would sound amazing but the it would cut noise for like 2 or 4 seconds and then come back and when you are playing a horror game it really sucks cuz it distracts you also you can use the headset without the amplifier like on your phone but the cord is to short but the overall headset with amp the cord is short and it doesn't isolate sound that much but it still does a great job and if you play music like at 30 or more people will hear what your listening to idk maybe its to light weight and covers my ears perfect and the speakers on this headset are huge to so I would recommend it but just be aware of the amplifier problems.
5,"PC physical copy is just an Origin code, no CDs.","While I have not played the game enough for a full review, I do very much enjoy it.  That said, this is also a warning. Unless you are getting a significant discount that makes up for shipping costs and then some, do not buy the physical copy of the PC version. It's still just an Origin code in a box."
1,Don't buy this.,Save your money. Game is boring and has graphics that look even cheaper than a free game on a Happy Meal box.  Game mechanics get repetitive way too quickly. The only entertaining part is when Santa gets frustrated and swears.
5,Very nice keyboard,"I've owned quite a few keyboards and especially mechanical keyboards. After my wife took my Logitech G512, my favorite keyboard except that it's not TKL, I needed to find another board. I've used HyperX gear before, I have their headset and love it, so I figured I would give this a shot. I agonized over the specs of the this board vs the G512, Razer huntsman TE and others. On paper these switches are not as quick and have more travel then the other two options. However, in real world use you don't really notice the difference. The linear switches are very smooth and the overall bottom out sound is not too loud. I would say the G 512 is a tad bit quieter. There is vertually no wobble with the keys either, which is something from the 512 I really came to like. The RGB color is nice and clear, better than the G512. The software is super easy to use and seems to be nice and light weight. Plus you can save three profiles right to the board which my G512 couldn't do. Overall very happy with my purchase."
1,One Star,Do Not Buy. Is not what is being shown.
1,UGH,I keep getting unauthorized charges for this stupid download. I don't even know what it is. Amazon needs to work on better ways of having refunds for this. Hackers keep doing this to my account and it's irritating.
4,However the company gave such great customer service when I contacted them about this,"Originally I gave this only a one star because, this is not compatible with the Wii U.  It will only connect to the Wii. However the company gave such great customer service when I contacted them about this, that I am happily changing this to 4 stars.  I will update the review after I get this product working"
5,YES I PROCLAIMED THIS BEAST DEAL!!!,I love Sony this sucker was the best deal on a PS3 EVER!. Thank you Amazon for having this available and kick-ass customer service. To all the ones that got this deal too I applaud you I did not expect this was going to sell out this fast.
1,Please don't buy this...,The console has state of the art built-in cooling. You do not need a useless piece of plastic snapped onto it to make it any better.
4,Way more durable than the older version,"I was scared to order another headset from Razer since I had the older version of Kraken Pro and the earpieces just broke off, but I couldn't help myself, where else was I going to get a pink headset that wasn't from China? So, I decided to try and I wasn't disappointed. They're beautiful, comfortable and sturdy, and best of all? The piece that had broken off on the older version is now made of metal, so there's no way that's going to happen again. If anything, there's hardly any noise canceling, so you'll be able to hear everything outside of your headset (which to me is a plus, but I know most don't want that) and same goes for the mic, everyone will hear you smash your keyboard and people talking around you, so there's that. Other than that, I loved it and I'm even considering the cat ears now."
1,TOTAL JUNK!,"Don't waste your money, half of the games do not work, the controller settings are a nightmare, most of the games have glitches, some of the languages are not in English and can't be changed! The instructions are awful, can't make heads or tails of them, what a waste of money! My I-phone has better games! Buyer Beware!!"
5,Microsoft Finally Got the Controller Right!,"The original controller that Microsoft released with the XBox was like the system itself, big and bulky.  Those of you who remember how your hands felt after playing hours of Halo with those big bulky controllers will truly apreciate the new ""S"" type controllers.  They are much more comfortable on your hands and make game play much better.  Your hands are not crampy and in pain like before.  The most notable difference will be in the white and black buttons.  I remember how annoying it was to  have to reach all the way to the top of the controller in an odd fashion to hit one of those buttons.  They are now on the bottom of the controller, and it takes geting used to, but you will find they are much easier to reach and work way better in the new spot.  All the buttons on the controller are more accessible and the control sitcks are easier to use.  The blue color on this one is just cool and since it is the same price why not go for it?"
5,Baby game. Good for 4 year olds.,"My sons were able to get all the coins and pup treats in this game. They sort of learned to play games with this. After paw patrol, they went on to play ray man with me and they're good at it now. good first platformer. Boring as hell if you aren't 4 years old though. If you are 4, you'll love it x100."
1,Does NOT fit xbox 360,This cord does NOT fit the xbox 360 with the 203w power brick. The 203w brick's power cord has a notch in the end. This cord will NOT fit as it doesn't have the notch on the end that plugs into the brick. The description needs to be updated to reflect this issue so that people don't mistakenly order the wrong part thinking it wil fit their console.
5,Great purchase,Just received my Wii remote. Was surprised to find it came with a silicone sleeve and batteries. Works perfectly. Very happy with my order.
1,Wow,Price gouging pos.
5,Great Charger,"I love that I can plug it into my PS4. But beware, it only charges the controllers while the PS4 is running. Otherwise you can plug it into any USB port you want. It charges great, and I picked this one for the blue LEDs."
5,Great product,"Great mouse, kinda weird DPI settings, don't use them often but fun to just click...I game a lot during the week and this mouse is definitely a great mouse to use if you enjoy Moba'ss and MMORPG's"
5,Sound quality,Better than I thought. Sounds sooooo good adding awesome quality sound with my wireless skull candy headphones.
1,Don't waste your money,Another major miss by EA Games.  The game looks really good but the gameplay is not all that.  I already uninstalled it and tossed it in the 'never to be played again' box.
1,The Worst Game,"I bought this game hoping for a Casino (hence the name) type of gambling experience.....well, it was nearly impossible to maneuver around the Casino,  When I selected a game to play, the machine played a totally different game!!  The sound was obnoxious and the graphics were blurry!!  I cleaned my glasses several times thinking that no one would put out a blurry video game!!!!  Don't waste your money on this game!!!!"
4,Very fun,"The game itself is quite fun , I am giving it a 4 star since I never received my code for pre ordering to get endevor ..."
5,"Feels good, works good.","The feel of this joystick is solid. I can spend many hours playing games for the sole sake of holding the sidewinder. Force feedback is intense, aiming is excellent, and it makes games more fun. Finally, the layout of  the buttons can't be better...perfect two handed action. Worth it!"
5,Perfect for Retro Pie,Using these with a raspberry pi install (Retro Pie).  Very well constructed.  Work like a charm!
1,This Game Is Mid Af,This game is the epitome of litteral garbage. Worse than the avengers game.
5,Pac this one up!,"Pac-Man Collection has four old but great Pac-Man games which are newly restored on the GameBoy Advance. It includes the regular arcade old Pac-Man,the colorful version of Pac-Man Arrangement,the wonderful 3D Pac-Mania,and the tetris game of Pac-Attack. The old Pac-Man is just plain chomping on dots and avoiding ghosts. Pac-Man Arrangement is a more detailed and colorful version of the old Pac-Man. Pac-Mania is just like the others but it's in wonderful 3D and Pac-Man also can jump to avoid the ghosts. Pac-Attack is tetris with a Pac-Man theme to it. You stack blocks and ghosts and you stack Pac-Man near the ghosts so he can gobble them up. Pac-Man Collection is a great game with four great Pac-Man games which are loads of fun. One of the best GameBoy Advance games around."
5,Great keyboard for a great value,"I bought this keyboard due to its cheap cost and cool look and I have to say, I was not disappointed. There's tons of different options for the rainbow color keys, which is super rad. However, there were downsides to this keyboard. First of all, it didn't come in any packaging. It was just the box the keyboard came in like something you would buy at a store, with my name stamped on front. If I wasn't already home when this thing came, it would've definitely been stolen off the porch. It screams ""fancy keyboard"" and anyone walking their dogs or something can see a rainbow keyboard just sitting there on the porch with the great opportunity to take it. Second, the keys are a little bit squeaky. This isn't a very big problem, just a bit annoying. Mostly the A, S, and : keys are squeaky, but it will probably sound better in the future. Anyways, the keyboard works perfect, no input lag or anything, and I can type even faster now. Great value for a great price!"
5,Please.  Looks brand new and function perfectly,Very pleased.  Arrived as specified.  Packaging was as if it was brand new.  Everything was included.  It hooked up easily with no issues.  The only down side is firing it up the first time.  Needs to update its OS.  Something with with the games.  Updates take awhile.  Suggest you do that right away and give it several hours.  Overnight would be best.  I do like all the Apps available.
1,Pass on this,"This game is not very good. Traded it in after two days. It's very repetitive and no multiplayer playability without using the play station network, no head to head battles in your friend's basement."
4,"Obviously a minority opinion, but . . .","This game is not perfect.  A good start is immediately tossing the slip cover into the garbage.  Beyond that, my 3 year old and 5 year old enjoy the game.  My 5 year old can play by herself, and my 3 year old can't.  If you're searching for something to entertain your kids while doing something else, this is not the game for you.  I sit with my 3 year old and help her with the motions if she is having trouble, but as we've gone along its gotten easier.  I imagine with a little more experience, my 3 year old will be able to mostly do this without me being so hands on.  The games are repetitive and short, perfect for the little one, though the 5 year old is getting bored with it very quickly.  The price seems really high for an Early Childhood game.  I was willing to pay the price to give my little one another medium to work on her letters and numbers."
4,Stellar controller,"This controller is clearly custom designed with much thought put into the design. It is very accurate and gives the option of using a left analog, which is also very accurate. SFV is an issue ladden and unforgiving game, but the smoothness of this controller mitigates the nonsense. And the price was unbelievable. It's both cheaper and better than the Hori fight pads which get the best reviews. The reviews for this were bad, and this proves a theory I've been testing. I believe gamers are bashing the top pads to discourage fellow competitors. I got this on the recommendation of a youtuber who plays competitively. Don't listen to these other detracting reviews."
1,Can't cross play with ps5,What kind of rip off is this? You can't play with your friends if they have the same game on ps5. Utterly ridiculous and will be returning
5,Nice and small,Fast simple and works great
5,An mmo like no other.,"Take final fantasy 1-13 Add an Involving story ,great controls .Full of nostalgia with great pacing . So far 4 days in and I am hooked. Best mmo out right now , and the community worldwide is phenomenal."
5,PS Vita and now I finally own it on PS4 and this remaster for the PS4 was great really enjoyed it,"I'm a big FFX fan I own FFX on PS2, PS3, PS Vita and now I finally own it on PS4 and this remaster for the PS4 was great really enjoyed it!"
5,Don't miss out.,Love the keyboard. It isn't too loud and it isn't silent it has a happy medium. The mouse is great too cause it isn't heavy so games like H1Z1 where you have to pick your mouse up and move quickly it is very easy to do. I recommend this keyboard highly. And it's a plus all the cool colors.
5,Very satisfied.,"Awesome looking controller. Hope they keep this line going. One thing anyone looking to purchase this. compared to the phantom black you should keep in mind the risk of the color. This controller is a very bright white. Again looks great , just can def can show grime super easy, and or be stained easily, but that goes with any white controller ever."
1,Very Disappointing,"OK, it's my fault....did not do my research. The idea that a kids' game should require Gold Membership for Xbox Live is ludicrous. If I could give it zero stars I would have. Thankfully I was able to resell it locally, so not a huge hit, but will be steering away from Xbox anything in the future. Even if some portion of a game is available offline, I'm feeling the trend is for online membership, newest platform and additional fees to play an already high priced game. No Thanks!"
5,Good buy,Works well.
5,Loved it!,"I loved this mouse while it was alive. It worked very well and I liked being able to set my dpi buttons to specific settings depending on which game I was playing. Felt great, didn't hurt my hand at all. But alas... It died from my new kitten biting through the cord under my desk. But I did love this mouse, would recommend for the average gamer who wants a nice quick and reactive mouse! Just watch out for kitten teeth."
1,Not really cleaning the lenses,"I bought this Lens Cleaning Pen a while back for my Quest 2 and used it a few times.  But all it does is smear the lenses and stripes are showing on the lenses.  I am now using the microfiber cloths from my reading glasses and it does a better job.  I really wanted the pen to work and I read the instructions very carefully and tried and re-tried but to no avail.  This pen just does not clean the lenses at all, rather worsens the dust on the lens."
2,Yawn,Not nearly as good as the 1st. There are a million flash backs. They try and make you sympathize with the antagonist. Shocker Ellie is gay.... now a days it would have been more original to make her straight. It seems as though everything takes longer.... searching a draw used to be quick now there is a long pause. Movies are too long and there are too many of them. Hopefully if there is a 3 they can fix this terrible attempt.
5,Scrabble Complete,"I love playing Scrabble and bought this game for my Windows XP computer.  It worked a few times, but now I have a similar problem as others have mentioned - every time I try to play this, the computer locks up with a blank screen.  I can't even reboot, I have to totally shut it off and turn the power back on.  I have tried to buy this game twice thinking it was defective, but still doesn't work.  We have many games for the kids, and this is the ONLY one I like, and it doesn't work.  I hope someone from Atari will find this out and fix the problem."
1,WTF Bioware,"I can't believe this is a bioware game.  This game is a steaming pile of garbage compared with DA:0.  Just a linear console type game, not even an RPG just a hack and slash brainless waste of time.  Can not stress enough about what a huge let down this game is.  Shame on you bioware, shame."
5,Awesome purchase!,"I purchased 3 of these as Christmas presents for my girls 5, 6 and 9.  I opened all 3 of them to set up and have ready for Christmas morning when they open them.  I had no idea how awesome this game system was til I started setting them up.  I might even be more excited then my girls!!  We have an Xbox 360 kinetic, they all have a kindle fire, a Samsung Galaxy tab and we own a i-pad.  I have a huge feeling they won't even touch their other electronics after they open the Nintendo 3DS XL.  I love that it came with the pre loaded Mario game.  Mario is one of my favorite games and I couldnt ever get my girls to play Mario, but now that's its loaded into their Nintendo 3ds xl they will see how much fun it is.  I did order other cases to cover up the red Mario cover so they would still be girly enough for them.  Great buy!!"
5,Good and comfortable case,"Really liked the case, its comfortable and the switch seems quite protected. It is snugg while putting it on the base but overall a really good investment for your switch."
1,This game is defunct.,It was just announced that this game is no longer going to be supported by the end of November 2012. It is being closed down because the bean counters have no customer loyalty.
5,Earsex,What God must use to listen to Metallica.
2,Okay,"The Xbox 360 is fun to play when working, but it gets to frustrating when it isn't working. It wont connect to my controllers anymore and when it does it shuts down when I am playing the game. Otherwise great graphics and everything is good except for what i said."
4,Need instructions please,"Since I am legally blind, I need an audio instructions DVD. The written instructions are to small for me to read even with my magnifying glass. However the company had no way of knowing this. My husband has a hard time reading them also. I would appreciate some help. Love the headset and mic for my PC when I manage to get them to work."
5,Why aren't you playing this right now?,Everything you loved about the original with all the character depth that was technology limited by the original platform. Players old and new to the franchise will find something to love in this remake. If the biggest complaint here is that people wish there was more content you know Squenix must have done something right.
5,very nice,"Hi, I recently bought the inflatable kart for my son to use with his friends while they play mario kart. He loves it. He uses it every time he is playing Wii, and all his friends want to get one too, and be the one to sit in it while playing. I used an inexpensive electric pump to inflate it.  worked great. This is a fun, unique toy"
5,One of the best games this gen.,"This is one of the best games this generation! The graphics, the story telling, and the gameplay are all top notch. And plus 47.99 was a steal for a great game, a great TV show and two great backward compatible games! If you have an Xbox one, buy this game!"
1,XBONED(Console DOA),this console only looks good in living room but as a gaming console its absolute crap. it only uses 720p and 60fps do not buy
5,If you ever liked Breakout...,"Nervous Brickdown is an awesome revisiting of retro Breakout-style gameplay, wrapped in a much prettier and more innovative package, with many cool worlds to unlock.  Highly recommended for those of us who are older gamers!"
5,Great product,"Great value, great price."
5,"It's Mario Golf, what could be better","I was really stoked about this game releasing especially during a pandemic that has been limiting the releases of a lot of hit games. It's a great golf game a lot like Hot Shots golf with the gameplay but it offers a lot of different game modes and I'm sure there will be more content to come as there usually is with these games. People need to remember this isn't a game like when they use to release games on nintendo or super nintendo, you will get more content eventually. I work 6 days a week so I haven't had the time to beat the game like a lot of these reviewers I'm seeing on here. SO my takeaways are the amount of characters you can choose from is mad, I've been playing the adventure mode which is really neat, reminds me of pokemon some. They start you off where you're known as the upcoming rookie golfer, believe they call you a prodigy. You have to start by going around the map and talking to a good amount of people before you actually get started golfing, they teach you the mechanics of the game which is a pain at least to me but it's better to know all the controls and functions because it will make you a better player overall especially early on. I saw people complaining about courses but when you think about it even playing on the same course over and over isn't the same when you add in wind factors and weather change so I don't see this as a big deal. Rush mode is very cool because it entices you so to speak to want to play faster to get your ball in first so you really do have to be clutch in every moment in that mode. Overall I would get this game now, unless you have another game or two that is taking up your time then you really don't need the extra content but it's fun, controls are easy and it's Mario, when have they ever put out a game that wasn't amazing! Hope that helps."
5,Nice product!,"I just got this today but I am already pleased with it. I did tons of research to pick out the best charger, and I think this is a pretty good one. Easy to assemble, lightweight but not cheap, good value for price; Energizer is a reliable brand. The lights tell you if it is fully charged, and it says it takes 4.5 hrs to fully charge the new battery. The dock is attractive and matches the Wii. Most importantly it plugs into the wall, NOT a USB. Also the wriststraps easily fit no problem during charging. To me its not a big deal that you have to take off the jackets, becasue I end up doing that to play my guitar or drums for GHWT. I would reccomend this; hopefully it will last!"
5,Don't miss out on something amazing because some players want it to be easy,"Anyone giving this game a one star rating, dosen't want to take the time to learn the game. No Vr support, so what. Don't miss out on something amazing because some players want it to be easy. Its a space sim through and through. Its also an mmo. Having trouble? Wing up with other players. Work together and have fun together."
1,Should of known,"Ok, so I just received my n64 mario paper. And went to try it. The n64 I was sent, had crappy eva wires. So now I have to buy new. Thank a lot."
2,Cheaply made.,"This stand isn't all that great.  The picture on the box makes one think that the Xbox 360 somehow hooks onto it, but instead it's just sitting on it.  That's not very secure, so this thing won't stop your Xbox from falling over.  Also, the game storage doesn't allow for larger-than-normal cases; if you have the limited edition of Perfect Dark Zero, it doesn't fit in the game storage.  Other than that, if you want somewhere to put your games and your Xbox, this works."
5,Great purchase,"I bought this for my son for Christmas and he was so excited to get it he loves fortnite. There is a paper in the packaging that has the code and instructions for the v-bucks and it was easy to get them. I bought this on a lightning deal so the price was perfect. The remote is black my son just has a red skin on it in the picture, it also comes with a headset which is an ear piece and mic. Very happy with it."
4,My boys are enjoying it,"My boys are 9 and 6, and have been playing this game for the last two days.  They seem to like Life the best, but also really like the Mouse Trap game.  I like that I don't have to clean up any pieces from the real games.  I think its a great way to introduce your kids to these more complicated board games.  The games are quick, although the graphics are somewhat of a let down for PS3.  It looks much more like a Wii game graphics wise, but they don't seem to care and if they are happy, I'm happy."
1,Sucker!,"I was sucked in as this was billed as a Talonsoft game which Take Two bought a couple of years ago.  Talonsoft had a very good game in their Battleground series that had all of the things that another reviewer was looking for (some semblance of history!).  I was very, very disappointed, thinking that Talonsoft had been resurrected and the Battleground game improved but found this in its stead.  I enjoyed the Battleground Civil War games (Gettysburg, Shiloh, Bull Run, and Chickamauga).  Outside of the title, this game bears no resemblance to those games. Talonsoft's tactical games (East Front 2, West Front, Rising Sun and Divided Ground) were excellent, but they are not even supported anymore on the Web. Definitely a waste of my money."
5,Marina,Don't throw Marina away plz she is just as good as Pearl
5,The Best Case,"This is the best GBA case ever. Forget all thos other things there to small. This is just hte right size. It holds your GameBoy Advance, GameBoy Color, over 10 games an AC adapter, a worm light,instruction manluals, and has a litle room left over. You can cary it with the handel or the detachable shoulder strap. Its over a foot long, about a foot wide, and about 5 inches tall. Get this today!"
2,Too many updates needed.,"We are not really happy with the way the game has to have internet connection all the time. It is always trying to update and requiring to be connected. The whole point in paying for a game is so you can play it without it costing you more in the long run. The game it self is fun but having to update and connect to internet sucks. We live in a roural area and our data is limited, so we do not like having it using for stuff that should be able to run at least a week without having to connected to internet. We would not buy this again and frankly from what I understand the company that now produces these games have made all new games this way. So basically we will be trying to find all old games that were made before. 1993 or whatever."
1,"Really, really bad.","Everything written here is true, this game is horrific.  I hope to save one person from making the terrible mistake that I did.  Everything about this game is just wrong.  That is all."
5,Crash 4 smashes expectations.,An incredible sequel that works at a impressive licked 30fps while at the same time looking really sharp. None of the expected muddy textures you normally see in handheld (haven't tested it docked yet).
1,Buyer Beware,Buyer Beware this comes with the online only drm garbage. Ubisoft treats customers like criminals. Hey I just got a new Xbox. Sorry ubi I won't buy your products for any system.
5,"Great game, Great Gift.","For Final Fantasy fans, FFXIV is an outstanding edition to the series. Game time is always a great gift idea. However, in North America, Square Enix will cap your maximum allotment of game time at 180 days. So any game time purchased in advance beyond the 180 day cap will sit unused for quite some time and run the risk of getting lost."
2,It has a nice variety of games with same pixilated quality as the ...,"Husband bought it on a whim.  It has a nice variety of games with same pixilated quality as the original atari as well as the same awkward way to select multi player and level selections.  I would have ranked it higher but there is a big flaw, it does not come with paddles, which makes almost half of the games almost impossible to play, and the atari flash paddles seem to be out of stock everywhere.  My verdict- THIS IS NOT WORTH THE PRICE UNLESS IT INCLUDED PADDLES OR IF PADDLES WERE READILY AVAILABLE!"
5,Better Quality with extras included.,"Purchased these to go with Mario Party as a gift for my daughters birthday. I had already purchased a set from another vendor that were faulty out of the box and did not fit into any of the OEM parts that we already have. I returned the first joy cons and purchased yours. They are super good quality, fit in the controller grip, also came with the wrist straps that otherwise would have to be purchased separately. I am extremely impressed by the product and when we need to get another set for my son I will not hesitate to buy these again."
5,Durable and great quality,I buy my kids a lot of PS4 accessories.  My daughter usually breaks her headsets within a week or 2. This particular headset has lasted a month now. It has amazing sound quality for the price.  They are very comfortable and durable.
5,Timeless simplicity,"My 7 year old son is hooked on Minecraft, like many kids are.  We play together maybe 4 hours a week, it is a great bonding experience.  Although I play to bond with him, I thoroughly enjoy the experience.  I could play by myself and still enjoy it, to be completely honest.  The game is very simple but the open world, sandbox experience  means there is many things you can do.  Creative mode gives you the option to literally do whatever you want from a building perspective.  Survival mode adds a bit of realism and challenge to it, you have to harvest resources, survive through the night mobs, etc, etc..."
5,Great buy for the price!,Ordered these gaming headphones for my daughter. I decided to try them out before I gave them to her to test the quality of the headset. I will say that this headset is very comfortable. The cushioning for the ears enable her to wear them for long periods. The noise cancellation was wonderful. This headset blocked out all other noises. The mic is great. The sound from the headset is realistic and makes the gaming more real. The headset is lightweight.
1,Why,YouTube has all the reviews on why this game is garbage. Check out ryanmoody and uche nwaneri for context pn why this ea needs to lose rights asap
5,Great Game!,"This is probably the best multi user game out for the Wii U at the moment.  We played it for hours and hours yesterday and had a great time.  Up to five people can race at one time.  As someone else said, it is not Mario Kart but it is a pretty darn good racing game.  It is definitely worth the price."
5,Enjoyable game,"This was an excellent game, quite long play, uniquely interesting graphics, story line and many challenging locations. Wouldn't hesitate to get another one of these HO games."
5,My favorite launch title,"Since the Vita was released, I've been looking for a game that made it worth the purchase. I'm not a big fan of the Uncharted series and there aren't any good RPGs out for it yet, so I was pleased when the demo of this game was finally released. Upon completing the demo, I immediately purchased this game. The controls are a little sensitive out of the box, but I was able to customize them easily. If you are looking for a run and gun shooter, this isn't it. You have to use stealth sort of like Gears of War. But if you're looking for a great Vita experience and aren't looking for Uncharted, you should buy this game."
5,great fun game,This game is fun and entertaining. I am in my 20's and I love the Looney Tunes characters.  I enjoyed seeing many of the characters chase after me  (as Sylvester) while trying to catch Tweety.  It can take a LONG time for  younger players to find all the pieces needed to be able to move onto the  next level....but you don't want it to be too easy do you?  :)  Have fun.
5,Great starter game,"I bought this game as well as many others for my 6 year old. This game is terrific for a starter game. Dora doesn't ""die"". She can start again over and over without dropping back any levels. It really helps keep the frustration to a minimum when learning to maneuver the controls. She really loves this game and mom likes to play it too. The levels do get increasingly more difficult but not too hard for a young child until you get to the RainForest with ""climbing vines"". Mom tried at least a dozen times and could not successfully get Boots to jump and climb across all vines needed."
5,Amongst the best RPGs on the 360,"This RPG is the closest you will get to having an Oblivion-like experience. There are plenty of side quests to add to the main quest line. Additionally, the character progression and equipment upgrade systems are user friendly and really give the player control over their character. There is a slight learning curve, but after a couple hours of play the controls will feel intuitive and the menus will be easy to navigate. I am enjoying this game. I tried Two Worlds I and only made it several painful hours in before letting it go. This will not be the case this time around."
5,Father and Son unite,"The Father and Son I speak of are my own.  This game was purchased originally for my grandson, but his dad loves playing it just as much as my grandson does.  They sit down and take turns playing.  It provides a good bonding time for them."
5,Rumors are just Rumors.,"At first, the reviews of this were terrible. Saying don't buy this, this is a scam, it's not what think of a refrigerator. So, I talk to a very close friend of mine and said he likes it. So I gave it a chance. What's the worst that could happen. If anything, I'll return. I've had it for a month now, and I love it. Use it only when you want your cans to be nice and cold. Don't leave the fan running or you'll burn it out. Treat it like a cooler."
5,If you like MarioKart you'll probably love this!!,"I recently purchased a Playstation 3 and was sad to realize that MarioKart (my favorite game) is a Nintendo brand game and not produced for the Playstation. After researching a bit I found this game, Sonic Sega All Star Racing, and decided to give it a try. It is seriously the only the game I play! (My husband plays the other games :) The graphics are incredible! You can play split screen with up to 3 additional players which is really fun but can be a bit confusing on some levels because of the vivid colors and all the moving graphics in the background...but that hasn't kept me from racing everyone I possibly can! The characters you can be are really neat, a step back in time kind of...such choices as Sonic, Knuckles, Tails, Dr. Eggman, and even the Street Fighter guys!! There are a multitude of new drivers and courses, along with music, that you can purchase from the game store using the money you earn while racing :) The money isn't hard to earn either so it doesn't become frustrating at all when you are trying to work up to buying something new, you earn about 2,000 credits on average per race with new drivers and courses ranging in cost from around 4,000-35,000 credits. The game offers a variety of racing types for single player so you won't get bored easily, you can do time trials, grand prix challenges, missions, and single races...all of which earn you points and trophies. When playing with more than one player you have a choice of different race types as well, although I find that single race is the most entertaining as battles and the other options seem quite repetitive. I would highly recommend this game to people of all ages...I'm 31 and have a blast playing it! You can't beat the price at around fifteen dollars...unlike a lot of other games costing 35-55 dollars. The controls are easy to maneuver and you don't have to worry about trying to figure out how to work a million buttons all at once! Highly recommended...try it and I'm certain you'll love it!"
1,DO NOT BUY. RESEALED,All the packs were resealed! Do not buy you will not get Charizard!
2,Frustrating Skill-less Nonsense,"I've played every Ace Combat and this one is a waste of my time. The new Dogfight Mode (DFM) eliminates the need for skilled piloting. When you are close enough to the enemy, you can hit your controller bumpers and the plane goes into an autopilot dogfight on rails. During DFM you attempt to lock-on with a missile or shoot your opponent down with guns. I want to fly the plane, not ride it like a taxi. Also, the shift to the real world, oppose to the Eurasia Ace Combat universe added nothing to a fairly boring story. Also, the typical Ace Combat surreal super weapon (Jet Super Fortress, Island Attack Base, Death Star Run) was not there. You end up fighting something that we could actually have right now.  The helicopter, AC-130 and Blackhawk gunner levels were unnecessary. All the imagination and surprise is gone from this iteration. I'm not into Online Multi-Player so I have no opinion on that. Buy every Ace Combat, but this one."
5,Handy for Nintendo Switch travel gaming,"Picked this up before a series of business trips so I could bring my Nintendo Switch but leave the klunky standard dock back at home.  Paired this HDMI adapter up with a retractable HDMI cable and a decent USB C power adapter and had no problem getting the Switch running on the TV in my hotel room.  (I find some things, like Fitness Boxing, are just easier to play with a decent-sized screen.)  I've been very happy with this adapter."
5,Great case with room for all wave one figures and discs,"We picked this up at half off at a local store, and while I would not have paid the full price currently, I think it's worth every penny for what I paid. It has a compartment for the figures with two separators that can be moved around freely with velcro. They can even be placed diagonally if you wish. It was very easy to configure it to securely hold all our figures. We have all of the first wave of characters and the case is comfortably full, so when new characters come out, you will have to squeeze them in but you could probably fit several more if you don't mind them rubbing against each other. Each divider has 5 slots on each side for power discs, which means it can hold all 20 of the series 1 discs. The exclusive Mike's Car is on his own, however. There is a clear, zippered cover that closes over the figure compartment. A large magnetic flap folds over the entire thing and secures on the other side. Two velcro straps help ensure it doesn't open when you don't want it to. When the flap is folded out, it has a little play area for your portal and figures. The portal can be stored in this special portal slot at all times if you wish. It slides into a clear plastic sleeve and the cord can be secured beside it with two velcro straps when not in use. When it's time to play, the portal can stay into the plastic sleeve as it has cut outs for all the slots on the portal and doesn't interfere with play. Just remove the cord from the velcro and plug it in and you're good to go. Perfect for traveling to a friend's house with your collection or even just for storage. It's really nice to have everything in one place. If you don't want to store the portal in the sleeve, there's also a pocket designed to fit the portal on the back of the case which also securely holds the portal. Overall, a very nice, high quality case. You won't need anything else to hold all your collectibles, at least until the next wave comes out!"
1,Unplayable on arrival,I was very disappointed that the package arrived and I couldn't even start the machine because the controller did not work. It powered on (the green light flashed on the controller) but could not turn the console on or communicate with it any way. Also the tray was often sticky and sometimes could not be open or shut. I had no choice but return it.
1,Broken and missing parts,"Wow what a scam. The item arrived broken, dirty and missing the controls. The power cord is in an unsafe state being held together by electric tape. It's going back tomorrow"
1,"freezes completely during game play, full system boot.","I'd you google around the internet for ""madden 15 freezing"" - you'll see a few forums at EA.com increasing slowly about the game freezing during game play.  As it turns out, the game freezes during gameplay whether its the digital download or the disc. Poor job of EA releasing such a buggy game to patch later. I have yet to complete one game due to the game play freezing. Avoid this until freezing is solved."
1,Defective battery pack,"I received my headset super fast but the ""rechargeable"" battery pack was defective. I tried to message customer service but they didn't seem to care, I want to keep the headset since I've already put stickers on it and i like the headset but the battery pack will not hold a charge at all. hopefully customer service will let me return the battery and get a new one. but doesn't seem like it they kind of just brush you off as a customer"
4,"For the price, this headset is Amazing!","I will say this right now, the RGB and Sound Quality is very good for these headphones' price tag, and as for the microphone quality, I did a test between my studio audio technica mic vs the headset mic, and while the headset mic sounds inferior (as expected), it is actually rather close to my other mic, only slightly lacking in ability to record lower decible sounds for higher quality voice.. making this product an absolute bargain. I do not like hos the microphone cannot be completely moved out of the way for if you are just using the headphones, but that is just a personal gripe. looking for a cheap headset with decent quality? look no further, get this."
4,much better than solitarie,"This is a one person game. You can play with two to five other computer players. Each of the computer players has three levels of I.Q. This can make the time to play the game vary. Other than that is is CLUE. if you like the board game I think you'd like this as well. It is a solo game, but it sure is better than a deck of computer cards. Sound effects can be turn off if you don't need to hear a 'corny' scream. The Music is SO-SO.But that is not why I got the game. My money was well spent."
5,Five Stars,It is in good condition and it looks new
5,Awesome Collector Item Both In Game And For Collectors,The Amiibo came in perfect condition no damaged packaging or any flaws. I bought this for use in Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild (BOTW) Game for the Nintendo Switch. Works great and is a nice collector item for my collection. This Amiibo will get you the exclusive Deity armor and weapon from Majoras' Mask as a in game item for BOTW game for switch it is a chance based thing so just be a little patient. The seller got it to me in two days with no problems and was exactly as described. Thanks for the fantastic Amiibo!
5,Second favorite switch game so far!,"This game is so fun so far! It deserves more fans. The combat is easy and fun. The story has been compelling so far. I've enjoyed how the puzzles and things are simple enough to play without headaches. The art is beautiful. I look forward to playing the rest of the game! It is currently my second favorite switch game that I've ever played, after Yonder The Cloud Catcher Chronicles. I love playing games that are easy but have a fun story. I almost got the original back when it came out first and I'm so glad I didn't second guess this time and actually got it!"
1,"Biggest rip off of any game, ever!",The most overpriced game I have ever seen. FIFTY TIMES THE PRICE of the same exact game on smart phones. I hope this comes back to bite their business in the butt. There's no excuse for the extreme overpricing of a .99 cent app. A total and complete joke. I'd rate it a zero if I could.
1,why xbox one......WHYYYYYY,"Disc read error it said....chewing up my game like it hasn't ate in years while I'm standing there eyes wide open with tears flowing out creating a puddle on my freshly made tombstone pizza (pepperoni) below me. I was all set for a looonnng wknd. Had my 64oz cup of strwberry fanta, bottle of visene, cheetos and fritos (with bean dip of course) for later and a couple of nitro pills incase my heart couldn't take the extravaganza of what was to come. Well anyways I was unpacking the box with anxious hands that could not hold still collecting paper cuts after paper cuts as I was going deeper n deeper in the box (My hands haven't shook this much since I attempted to unlatched my 1st bra on my ex gf.... now my sister in-law). I finally got it out of the box and hooked everything up correctly.  Turned on the tele and was getn excited (the type of excitement u get when you see those see through yoga pants and realize that this is the moment you lived your whole life for). Put in a game and heard a horrible noise. No, not a fainting sound of the ice cream truck going down the road and you realize you just missed your opportunity to get one of those yellow and brown chocalate fudge pops that reak of deliciousness. No, this was a hearing something happening to your mom by her then boyfriend through very thin walls that you DO NOT want to hear even tho she's enjoying it type of noises. So now I'm sitting here cold pizza in my hand  and cheeto crumbs in my beard with hatred and disgust. So back in the box you go and returned you will be mr xbox 1. Never have I felt so bad other than the time woke up naked in a park with catnip in my creavaces and a hickey on my thigh with a homeless guy puking beside me but that's another story. Needless to say...glad I bought the ps4 last wknd. Have a good day guys n gals...can't get worse than mine."
5,Great PSP AC Adapter,"So my dog ate through my old PSP adapter and I came on here to see if I could pick up a new one.  I didnt feel like spending full price on the Sony one, so I gave this a try.  Works perfectly and is much cheaper than the sony brand.  Ive had it for a few months and no problems whatsoever.  I would buy this again and recommend it."
5,Great Game With Lots of Depth,"This is the Eighth expansion of Ultima Online - one of the great online roleplaying games.  The game has old-fashioned graphics, but it is still the only game that lets the player customize each character's skills - and now - race.  There are plenty of options for crafters - this game has the most options for crafters available.  There are also lots of new monsters and lands to explore.  This is a great game."
4,Backup Backup Backup,"Just installed Quicken 2011.  As expected the installer removes your old version.  Unfortunately, the new program was unable to read my old Quicken data file so had it had to restore from backup.  Luckily I had a recent backup or I would have had to re-enter the latest data."
2,I really enjoyed playing this game on PS3,"I really enjoyed playing this game on PS3, when I heard it was getting remastered, I got really excited. I feel cheated; there's only one gane in the disk, even when the cover says otherwise, I don't like games in digital version, if I wanted that I would have just purchased in the Playstation Store, very disappointing!"
4,"Legendary RPG that could be better, but still above average","Anyone remember the Sega CD?  I do (I still have mine) and one of the best games for that Genesis add-on was Working Designs' Lunar: Silver Star.  Eventually it would make its way onto the PS1, and it has now arrived on the GBA with varying results.  Lunar Legend is a re-telling of sorts of the original game  with varying differences; such as characters showing up in different places, cities being designed different, and parts of the plot and storyline have been changed.  The full motion anime cut scenes and full orchestral score obviously couldn't make the cut onto cartridge format (the anime cut scenes have been replaced by anime cels which pop up now and then), but the overall graphics of different towns and character designs are much improved over the original.  Battles are much better as well by being faster paced, better animated, and more character detail than ever before.  New options have been added such as the Arts Gauge and a new card collection, and menus are easier to navigate through than before, except the shop interface can be a pain now and then.  All in all, if you missed out on the Lunar phenomenon that older gamers beared witness to years ago, Lunar Legend is a good pickup.  Then again, if the original Lunar was a beloved game of yours, this GBA conversion won't add anything since it's missing most of it's original charm (and the overall epic feel), but nonetheless this game is still a more than solid pick up."
2,Game cards don't fit.,"Very nice protective case bag, fits my Nintendo 3DS XL. The downside is that the game cards doesn't fit on most of the slots provided as shown on my picture."
1,DO NOT BUY DOWNLOAD CODE!!!,"The game, as of it's release, is not available on Steam.  If you purchase the download code and input it into Steam, nothing will happen."
5,Great value,I bought these for my son. He loves them and with 10 at this price they were a good value. They arrived in pristine condition and on schedule
5,What Sim Theme Park should have been!,"When I got Sim Theme Park, I was very disappointed. It was very challenging to keep your money balance normal, let alone high. When I got Sim Coaster, I expected what Sim Theme Park was like. Man, was I wrong! Sim Coaster is like Sim Theme Park with everything it needed. You can finally charge for rides. Roller coasters and log flumes seem to cost a lot less. Sim Coaster is a more detailed version on Sim Theme Park. Yeah, it has an annoying advisor (female this time), but she isn't as picky as the original adivsor. In Sim Coaster, you can get opinion summaries to improve the ride easily. Gardeners are added in this game to water plants. Though there is only three parks in this game, they are better than the ones in Sim Theme Park. To open up different parts of the park, you must complete objectives given to you. Staff can be trained to do new things such as janitors being able to fight fires, or guards with first aid to cure sick guests. Challenges are given, too, but you don't have to start them right away, they are listed and you may start them anytime you wish. You can also do more than one at a time, and most of them have a preparation time which gives you time to set up before to challenge starts. Overall, this game is awesome, so don't buy Sim Theme Park and buy Sim Coaster!"
1,Rent This Game Before You Buy it. I Wish I had.,"The old games included, Galaxian, Xevious, etc, are indeed copies of the classic games.  But the game screens are surrounded by ""special remix borders"", in other words, the game screens are reduced in size. The old games have not been modified to take advantage of the Wii controller.  The new ""remixed"" games do not utilize the Wii controller well and lack the fun of even the basic Wii Sports game that came with your console.  Do NOT buy the game unless you rent it first."
1,Faulty product,The amiibo was broken at the leg
5,having the ease of having a global system headset is amazing! Not to mention the quality with the anti ...,"Easiest set up on a headset I've ever had to buy, bought 2 one for my Xbox and one for my PC, having the ease of having a global system headset is amazing! Not to mention the quality with the anti lag is flawless! Never a bad buy with steel series you guys rock !"
2,I don't care for it,"It's a mess. Nothing is intuitive about this game. You can wonder around for hours and not find what you want to find. I've been searching for a certain task for hours and I can't find it. If you like getting stuck in muck then yea, you'll love this game. An in game GPS would work great but instead you get a little marker on the screen in front of you. This is an exercise in frustration at best. I played driving games 10 years ago that were easier to navigate than this one. You'll read that some people here like this. Great! That is their opinion and this review is mine."
5,Finally A Great Jurassic Park Game.,"Very fun game to play. This includes all 4 movies in 1 that you can choose to play. However you have to beat Jurassic Park to unlock Lost World and beat Lost World to unlock Jurassic Park 3. Plenty to explore, even unlock vehicles and dinosaurs with a variety of characters to play as. The humor is hilarious especially with the dinosaurs. Best of all you can play ad Jeff Goldblum and the character voices are all from the movies."
5,Great for getting into the inner-workings of your Nintendo products,"Want to open a shady Earthbound cartridge to see if it's authentic? Wanting to clean that 11-year old Wii but the bastards at Nintendo sealed it up with some obscure screw bit? Get this tool kit! It includes every single screw bit that Nintendo uses on pretty much all their products along with a couple of other goodies to ensure that just about anything Nintendo or not can be opened with reasonable-ease. I opened my GameCube to clean it with this tool kit and I accomplished my take relatively quickly. To get even more hands on I replaced my GBA Sp's housing as well and with the help of this tool kit it was also accomplished with ease. The tools appear to be a of substantial quality, as well. Just take care of them and use them appropriately and you have a very nice tool kit to tackle any dissection of a Nintendo electronic device."
5,High quality ; low price. Worth every cent!,"My husband is very into electronic gadgets, I'm not usually great at picking them out - however, he was very thrilled with this. From the functionality - to the sleek design it was a winner here. We have ps4 slim. The controllers slide in and charge very easily, can almost just drop it on there and it charges. I would pay double what I did for this. 5star value!"
5,Fun park simulator with dinosaurs,Fun park simulator with dinosaurs.  A little slow at the start with a lot of the cool dinosaurs hidden.  I am about to start my 3rd island after having unlocked everything on the first 2.
5,"Mehh, now that I read my review I'm not so happy","Bought these on impulse cause I desperately needed new ones.... couldn't be more happy. Actually, scratch that..... they could have came with a sandwhich... definitely would have been more happy if it came with a sandwhich. You know what, forget this review how do I get in touch with the marketing department, I've got a great idea"
1,Good if you need a keyboard for a month,"I was really happy with this purchase for about a month. I use this keyboard 5 days a week for work.  While I do use it alot for work, I am not on it ALL day. About 1 week ago I started noticing that I was missing the letter A in a lot of the text I was writing and blamed myself for the mistake. Until it kept happening. So I did a little test and wrote 10 A's in a row. Pressing the key down the same every time. aaaaaaa  7 A's it what it typed. As I am writing this I am having to go back and edit everything I am writing. I have no issues with any other letter but the letter A is used very often and I am left spending so much time editing what I write. I am really disappointed because I really liked this keyboard but I need accuracy when I am at work. I will be buying another keyboard elsewhere."
5,One of the Best Need For Speeds On the Market,I have bought the New Version of Pursuit and found it is better then previous not wasting all the time customizing the cars more racing much better version. I wish I'd have waited for a rebate or coupon little pricy for a XBox game but will not tire easily..
5,Best mouse pad ever!,"Coolest mouse pad I have ever bought. Its very blingy and the lights work great. If you have an epic naga and black widow epic chroma the three items look bad ass. Works very well with razer synapse and you can configure the colors there, set up different profiles...great thing is that i dont have to log into a different software I can just adjust all my settings for my 3 razer peripherals from one location. High quality build and very sleek. The mouse just glides on it like water... its amazing my shooter skills have improved immensely after buying this... try it you wont regret your purchase. Ive gotten alot of compliments on it"
5,Yet More Pokemon,"Pokemon Stadium isnt that much different from the first, but its pokemon and we love it.  The concept of the game is the same where you choose you favourite pokemon to battle against the computer or against a friend.  If you are a die-hard pokemon fan then i recommend that you buy this game to remain the ultimate pokemon champion. Pika"
1,was sooooooo lost,NOT FOR BEGINNERS.  The trainer was spitting out names of Yoga poses I have never heard of or done before.  There was not a step by step instruction to any of the poses just things like mt. pose to down dog to plank to monkey to ect...  I have no clue what those things are it would be nice it it had the option for a step by step insturction to each of the poses so you know what the heck you are doing.
1,I used to love final fantasy but now i feel so disappointed i ...,"I used to love final fantasy but now i feel so disappointed i can't even access to my game i have to pay for dlc and season pass, don't buy this is not worth it"
1,"Bad design, poor assembly","I got 2. 1 was an exchange because I thought the first one just wasn't working correctly. I put it together, but the bottom try would not clip in to the right, or ""R"" side. I tried using force, and even without the bottom ""tray"" in the slot below. It would not connect. I got a new one and the same thing happened. It just doesn't fit easily. Any more force to try and get the clip in and the plastic would break. I tried to see what it would be like if it would have fit all together, but the bottom drawer is smashed between the two plastic sides to hold it in place, making it impossible for a practical use drawer due to how stiff it is to open. I have issued my final return today. I would not recommend this for your Switch."
5,Ecstatic Child who Loves Trains,My 7 year old is autistic and adores any and every thing concerning trains.  We have ordered several of the simulators and spent many hours playing.  Very realistic with many options that other products do not have.  It's an enjoyable way to spend time with my child at his happiest.
5,Keep chasing the cake!,"Portal is back and better than ever!  The tests are as mind bending as ever, and they've added new elements, like light bridges and emancipation gates.  The graphics are smooth and attractive, but nothing that's going to make your jaw drop.  The controls are as simple and effective as the first game.  But then, none of that was what worried me.  I had no doubt that they would be able to recreate and expand upon the technical aspects of the first game.  My concern was whether or not they would manage to capture and continue the personality and sense of humor of the first game.  I am very pleased to report that the sequel does not disappoint.  The sequel pics up right where the first game left off, and GLaDOS holds a grudge.  Her insults, passive aggressive comments, and general malice will have you chuckling throughout the game.  Your new companion and guide robot also adds to the character of the game, though he can be a bit heavy handed at times.  If you enjoyed the first game, you will love the sequel, both for its expanded challenges, and its unique personality.  As long as you enjoy a good puzzle and have a sense of humor, you will never regret this purchase."
1,dated and incomplete game,"Well it's a pretty bad game.  Like nachos smothered in cheese, throw some jalapenoes on there, a little hamburger goes a long way, but what where's the onions.  Grandma's cookin'.  The game's a lot like Sir Joseph Conrad but this is supposed to be the 22nd century not the early 19 hundreds."
5,Works with Xbox One,My 7 year old son loves this game - he uses it on the Xbox One so I know it will work with the One.
5,Splinter Cell is a MUST!!,"First of all, let me tell you that this game is based on a Tom Clancy's written novel. He usually writes books related to terrorism, like The Sum of all Fears. Enough about the author. The game is just great! Its about a spy sort of guy name Sam Fisher who has to accomplish tons of missions. All the game is based on stealth, which means you have to do things quietly and without being watched by anyone. The variety of weapons are excellent, plus the items you use are incredible. One of the most interesting things about this title is that you don't have to kill the bad guys to accomplish your objectives, you can just knock them out and hide them. The game is pretty frustrating at times, like when a camera discovers you, you loose the mission. There is only one little problem with this amazing title, and that is its replay value. It is absolutely a game to play once, it has no new options of coming again and play it. Basically, once complete the game, your done with the title (no multiplayer, no extra missions, no new weapons, no new characters,etc.). Overall, the game is a must for any gamer. And Tom Clancy fans, don't think twice before getting this!"
5,Best dock,It works perfectly and doesn't overheat the Switch
1,Wait a little while,"I am a veteran player. Me and wife both play this game. Guild Wars 2 has offered us a lot of playing time. We have enjoyed this game for about 2 years now and still play every night. The problem is when there is a major update Anet keeps changing your builds, resets your traits, and changes the way you level new characters. I have 10 characters in this game all level 80. I have done this to keep up to help new players because of  the build changes and the new leveling systems. Note that I have bought 5 new character slots with cash to help new players out. Now Anet releases a new game that we have to pay for again. I am going to buy this just because my wife really enjoys it. I already know that when I log in today that all of characters builds will be changed again. I will have to relearn the game again. I will have to make a new character and learn how to level it. The next thing is that when any new update happens I will have to learn how to get my build back and help all the new players again even though they got the base game for free. My advice is to wait about 3 to 6 months to buy this expansion and game for new players as well as veteran players. See if Anet drops the price and if the  players are complaining about the game. Wait until the bugs are fixed which there will be by the way."
5,Highly recommend if you play for long hours.,"I LOVE THIS!! The fan is easy to use and it reads the temperature of my console and cools accordingly!! And little to no noise, can't beat the price either."
5,Recommend!,So cute and quality products.Worked exactly like it was supposed to.Everything about it is great!Higher recommended.
5,Fun for both of us,"My wife and I have played through worlds one and two, and we are both really enjoying the game.  The game is a very good combination of challenge and fun, and we've found ourselves laughing out loud at the fun and intensity of the experience more than once."
5,Fine work and great gaming experience,"The material feels like real car's wheel (at least, comparing with my Audi S5 but much smaller obviously). Smooth force feedback. Button layout is the best in wheels that I ever found, feeling better than TMs. Fine work, the wheel, shifter, and the pedals. The pedals are reality (also comparing with S5, except the max depth of the break). Works for PCs, and also has a switch for changing between PS3 or PS4 mode. The shift light also works for PC if the game supports it (like PCars). If the game is old but compatible with G27, G29 will also works fine. Just more expensive than expected."
1,WARNING!!!,"In the middle of the night, the power adapter blew up creating a loud noise and a giant spark of blue light.  At the time of the explosion, the nintendo was not even on or being used!  It was just simply plugged into my power strip where all my pricey electronics are plugged into.  Was not even overloaded with multiple plug ins.  I would take caution when buying products from this seller!  They did refund my money when I told them what happened, but this is some major BS.  This product is not safe for consumers.  Don't want to see anyone else get ripped off."
1,Piece of junk!,"My ps4 has been very noisy and hot, so I bought this to cool it down and perhaps make it a little quieter. However, the two fans don't run like normal computer fans. They're very noisy, and don't blow much air. My couch is about 15 feet away from my TV and I could still hear this fan over the sound of my game. 30 minutes into my game, I got up and felt my console, and it was still very hot, just slightly cooler. I'm disappointed because I like having a built in charger, but the ineffectiveness of the fans and loud noise is why I'm returning this. Don't waste your money."
1,"Console was defective, kept freezing","I purchased this last month.  I played briefly (less than an hour) only a few times, intermittently over the course of the month, so not a lot of heavy use.  The console would freeze while trying to install games from disk, as well as freeze during game play.  Sometimes it wouldn't even load the game at all, or would get stuck on the green loading screen for a long time and I would have to hard reboot it.  I spent more time pushing the power button and holding it for 10 seconds than I did playing games.  Returned the refurbed console, and am getting a brand new one with a game bundle instead for a little more money, but will be worth it."
1,Unacceptable mispronunciations! Ridiculous vocabulary!,"Although this game is fun at first, after a while I started to realize that even though the pronunciations sounded as though done by a native speaker, some of them are so off as to be laughable! For example the word ""ratio"" is pronounced ""ratito"" by the speaker! ""Utensilios"" is pronounced ""UNtensilios"", and so on.  And why would one wish to learn the word for ""sliver"" (""astillo"") without having first learned the word for ""little"" (""poco"") or other size-oriented words first? Not recommended! The mispronunciations are totally unacceptable for a language program."
1,unacceptable .,Capcom you have mess up Big Time. not putting the dlc on disc that is really unacceptable ya'll just plain lazy.
1,Previously opened package.,"I don't often review things at one star unless I'm genuinely disappointed. This is not advertised as a previous opened or refurbished controller. However, everything indicates this box had been opened previously, per the shoddy sticker barely holding it closed and the uncoiled cable. Maybe the controller will work fine, but as it stands, I'm not happy to get what appears to be a previous opened package, and for all I know a non-new, refurbished controller. That's a violation of trust, bare minimum. Buyer beware."
5,Physical disc.....Yes,I really enjoy having a real.copy. It bothers me the industry is trying to make the console experience like a steam box. I will be ordering this game soon.
5,Highly recommend!,Great product!  Reccomend to anyone!
4,Here we go again...,"The Lego series of games have struck yet again, only this time around they've joined up with none other than the Batman license.  Lego Batman for the DS is undoubtedly the best Lego-based video game to hit the DS yet, as you play as The Dark Knight himself along with his trusty sidekick Robin in tow, and take on some familiar faces from Batman's classic rogues gallery.  If you've played any of the other Lego videogames, you'll feel right at home here, and as you'd come to expect, there are hordes of unlockables and bonuses to find that will keep your interest.  The only downsides of Lego Batman are the same flaws that plagued the previous Lego-based games: the game itself is short and quite easy to get through, and gameplay-wise nothing has changed from previous outings.  Still, Lego Batman looks good with larger environments, and Danny Elfman's classic Batman film score is put to good use as well.  Plus, with all the unlockables, you'll be busy for a while.  All in all, if you dug the previous Lego games, Lego Batman is definitely right up your alley."
5,Perfect Switch Case!,"Perfect Switch case! I wanted something a little smaller for travel and this thing is perfect! The switch fits perfectly and there is room to store several game cards as well as a zipper compartment to store a charging cable. It feels very secure, and is nice and lightweight. The color is very much a rose gold and not as pink as the photos, but still very nice."
5,Amazing!!,"These headphones sound absolutely great!! My favorite part is that it doesn't take batteries, and it doesn't noticeably drain my controller battery either! Let's not even get into how well it matches the halo 5 Xbox one and controller, because it is awe inspiring. They even come with a cord so you can plug them into anything with a headphone jack and use them as normal headphones!! I highly recommend, 10 out of 10 for sure!!"
1,E-sports has ruined Gran Turismo,"This game is all about online game play.  Gone are the old single player cup days.  This thing is made for e-sports and e-sports training alone.  There is also a whole section of the game dedicated to taking pictures of the cars with about a thousand possible camera adjustments.  I dont remember photography being such a staple of racing.  It feels like they were building the game and stopped after they got finished with all the hard work, forgetting to put in any type of traditional career mode.  Also to get onto a race online you have to wait for them to become available.  Sometimes an hour of waiting.... for a single race.  The game sucks don't buy it."
4,Could have been so much better,"I bought sm3d all stars for one simple reason. I grew up in the nintendo generation. If you have a switch then I say this is a must have game. However it is very disappointing that nintendo didn't give this trio the justice it deserves. Especially sm64. Such an iconic game. (number 1 selling game of all time on the n64). It deserved a complete remaster. HD graphics, improved controls (the controls were total bs and that came with this addition as well) etc. Woulda, coulda, shoulda been amazing. So on one hand its cool to play it exactly as it was 25 years ago because it's what we had and it was all we knew. On the other hand it totally sucks to play it as it was 25 years ago because what we have now as far as tech is leaps and bounds better. Long story short - the nostalgia trip is cool and its a 3.5 star game overall but the lack of love from nintendo is apparent and disappointing. Do you need this game? Well let's be honest. We don't ""need"" any game. But if you're a full grown adult nintendo kid with a switch then there's no reason not to have sm3d all stars in your game collection"
5,Great RPG!,"I just finished Magical Starsign and it was really a joy to play. I logged in 36 hours and I haven't played the multiplayer yet either. The last RPG I've played to end was FF7, and while this one didn't come close to its emotional depth, I thought the play was pretty similar and the fights followed the same pattern. It took me a while to really understand the role of the elements, but that might just be me being a dummy. The only detraction I could think of is the cuteness, some guys might feel a little girly playing a game with sugarstars and gummy worms. I thought it was adorable though (but I am a girl, so that might be why). I would recommend this game to anyone and everyone, if you can get past the cute factor it's a really good RPG to get into!"
1,Not that great,"First of all I totally agree with La Coccinelle's review. I have plenty of memory, graphic cards and anything else that this game needs to run and it is terrible, the graphics in my opinion are cheesy, it took forever to load and as my person on Twiiki Island was actually having fun it all crashed on me. I have unloaded the game and now my computer is happily running how it always does, great...honesty I feel these expansion packs are being put together too fast and not tested really well. The more that come out the more I am getting annoyed, there aren't that much things that adds to decorations, as I said the graphics are cheesy and it is not worth the time it takes to load the game for it to just crash... I can't take it back so it will just sit on a shelf collecting dust waiting to see if they come out with a patch or SOMETHING that will get it to work...I would not buy this until it has been out long enough for the glitches to be worked out..."
1,not the steam version,I found out the hard way this is not the Steam version! Apparently Amazon now has a direct download version and a steam version and the activation keys are not compatible. I don't recall it being this challenging before. I'd like to note that Amazon graciously refunded my money upon request and they removed it from my download page.
1,Just get a new one,"Ok if the item information says that an SD card is included with the item, call me crazy but I expect an SD card to come with the item. Guess my surprise when i popped a game in this bad boy and got the error for a missing SD card. Also calling this thing a bad boy might be a little presumptuous because the top is peppered with scratches, much like the top screen. Dont take your chances with this one, go to your local gamestop or something else a little more reliable and consistent."
1,... Skylander games on the Wii and up until has loved it. He was so looking forward to it,"My son has played all of the Skylander games on the Wii and up until has loved it.  He was so looking forward to it, he used his birthday money for it.  Went to Target and got the game, he started to use it when we realized it was ONLY a racing game.  So disappointed.  We bought not only the game but many characters as well.  Most of the characters you couldn't even use on the game.  Went to Target to tell them we were disappointed and they let us exchange it for the Xbox360 version.  That version is the full version.  DO NOT BUY WII VERSION!!!!!"
1,Don't buy,This is also a boot leg copy. I cant give it as a gift. Waste of money wont even run
2,weak,"I was excited to play this game and thought it might be pretty good when I started out.  Graphics were good, sound effects and voice effects are good. but it doesn't take long to realize that it is just one new screen after another of fighting guys.  That gets pretty old pretty fast."
1,"Works better as a coaster, throw it in the trash","Can you give it a half star? Honestly the worst skate game...wait...worst game I have ever played. The controls are insane. You jump to grind and as soon as you press triangle, it will snap you onto the rail so hard, no matter how high above the rail you were or even if you weren't really aiming to grind. It is almost comical how poorly the controls are. Same goes for the graphics. I could not believe that on my 4K TV and PS4 something could look so PS1. The last complaint I have is that there are no customizble options that make any skate game worth it. Please save you money, I could not believe they are charging as much as they are for this piece of crap. Guaranteed if you bought this you are using it as a coaster, three it down the toilet, or are seriously depressed and made at yourself for owning this junk. Throw it in the trash."
5,My daughter's favorite DS game!,"We have had this game for about two weeks now and my 6-year-old daughter has played nothing else since we bought it.  It was easy for her to figure out on her own, which isn't always the case with DS games.  She loves to groom the horses and pick out riding outfits for Barbie.  But her favorite thing is taking her horse through the jumping course and winning ribbons.  There are a bunch of other activities and mini-games too. I would highly recommend this game to young girls, especially those who are horse-crazy like mine!"
1,Don't Buy-Junk,This is a collection of shareware for mainly outdated Pocket PC's. The software will not run under Windows Pocket PC 2003. Amazon should be ashamed for selling this kind of junk as their description of the product is very sparse.
1,low quality controllers with xbox,"controller trigger stopped working after 2 weeks, pathetic ....had my xbox 360 controllers for about 7 years with no issues"
1,Horrible!,I had 2008 and thought 2009 would be better.  WRONG!  I play rummy alot and you could double click a card to make it move to the discard pile in 2008.  You can't in this version.  You  have to manually drag it to the pile.  Also in some of the solitare games that I could go through the deck more than once in 2008 you can't in 2009.  I thought Encore would do better than this.  Also had problems with load and updates too.  Had to disable UAC in Vista to get it to work.  If you have 2008 stay with it.  If you are buying for first time buy 2008 not 2009.
5,Okay condition,"Got it in okay condition, it was bended from the top but the item was not damaged. Not a big deal as it meant to be opened. So, it's really a concern for collectors."
1,Terrible!,"I buy new,but send me used!!!This is third time in this month!Terrible!"
1,Nothing Special,"Decent game but they really blew it on the PR front. Only one character? No name changes? No LAN? If they keep this up, the 2nd and 3rd games will not sell very well. It will be interesting to see if they change their policies. But for now, the cons of this game outweight the benefits. Spend your money on something else."
1,Avoid these scalpers!!,Don't buy from scalpers! This is a game very dear to my heart and some scalper that doesn't care about anything but profit is trying to sell it for 3 times the price.
5,"Bond, James Bond....Wow it's good to hear that again!","James Bond games have been selling sky high ever since the fantastic debut of Goldeneye. They were all so much fun and you couldn't ever get tired of them, but there was one thing that many people requested-a third person mode of agent 007. Now, that option is finally here with enhanced picture and sound that will launch you beyound the games action! Now with the great video performace of video game consoles, the picture is so clear and acute that it litterally makes it much more fun to play or watch! But what is really great about this game, is that it keeps the persona of James Bond. Most games now are just shoot 'em up, blow this and that up, then complete the game within a matter of hours because there isn't any challenge, except this one. It has realistic objectives like those that you would see in a 007 movie, the picture is so0o0o clear its like you're watching movie, the challenge is enticing and fun, and best of all-it has a good plot! But of course James Bond still has some old habits of his: fancy cars (Porsche Cayenne, Aston Martin Vanquish, modified motorcycles, race cars etc.), Q's handy gadgets and gizmo's, beatiful women, worthy adversaries, and of couse: vodka martini; shaken, not stired. This game is so much fun to play you'll absolutely love it! Even if you were dissapointed by Die Another Day (i sure was), this game is one hell of a welcome back! My hat goes off to EA Games on this one!"
1,Bastardization of Candyland,"It's truly awful what they've done to Candyland.  My daughter is turning 3 and I really wanted to buy it for her, but this new version of the game is terrible.  As others noted, the characters are oversexualized candy girls (with lollipop bustiers - really Hasbro? - and platform heels).  This doesn't seem appropriate in the least for preschoolers.  One has to wonder what kind of ""Candy"" you're going to get in this ""Land""!  Also, I have a baby boy and want him to be able to play the game when he gets older too.  This version doesn't seem at all welcoming for boys.  It's quite girly.  Is Candyland for girls only now?  What a shame.  I returned this and found a 1978 version of the game on eBay.  No fairy girls with lollipop bustiers and platform heels.  A good size playing board.  A boy AND a girl, neither one oversexed, shown on the board.  I paid more but it's well worth it.  I recommend you head to eBay and find yourself a good vintage version while you can, because I bet they are going to be in high demand!"
5,I'm incredibly pleased with this console,The performance of the One X is incredible. Every game I throw at it seems to be running at 60fps without a hitch. No screen tearing. No stuttering. Load times are lightening fast. I'm incredibly pleased with this console.
5,If your thinking about it get it.,"It works great and I was a little skeptical because it is USB 2. But it works as well as my other USB 3 capture cards, as far as inputting the video signal. The only thing I don't like is the fact that it does not work without proprietary software running in the background. My other capture cards don't need drivers they are plug n play. However that would not stop me from recommending this capture card because if you are doing multi camera with a software switcher this is a good option it works with all the switchers I use for example OBS. Also if you use software switchers you know using 2 devices in the same hardware family can cause problems (if you didn't know, now you do). For example I have 2 other capture cards by the same manufacturer and the software gets confused and locks up because they show up as basically the same thing. Even two USB webcams, different models but same manufacturer causes problems with software switchers. So the thing I don't like helps because it shows up as a completely different device and makes it easier for the switching software to tell witch is witch. Since I got this I haven't had any problems switching between cameras. It worked flawlessly after I installed the software and it solved my problem with devices being too similar for the software. Great device if your thinking about it get it."
5,Better than Links LS 1999,"I have played all the major computer golf games, and Jack 6 is by far the best. From the witty commentary of Gary McCord to the tremendous graphics. This game is meant for the avid golfer who wants a real life game experience but cannot get away. Why this game hasnt attracted more  attention is really a mystery."
5,Was nervous to get it,"I have heard bad things about 3rd party dongles with the switch, but this one worked perfectly the first time i plugged it in and haven't had any issues the few times after that. Build quaility is good and the picture is clear."
2,"thoroughly enjoy using, WHEN IT WORKS!!","For the price its a great stick, thoroughly enjoy using, WHEN IT WORKS!! Have had it for only a month and at times the buttons on the stick stop working (Hat switch and triggers); other times the throttle stops working. They did not test this enough before release.  What makes this so much worse is the utter lack of any warranty or even response from thrustmaster customer service! its a joke....  Would love to get a replacement, would even pay for shipping if they would ever respond to me."
5,Amazing!,"Woah! this game is really fantastic! when I have bought the expansion for this game, my mom tried to learn how to play this game! Amazing! My mom is now certified as Sims Fanatic!"
1,Doesn't work with camera,"Got this for the PS5. It doesn't work with any camera so you have to use your phone and the Just Dance app. This means your wrist is constantly hurting. Despite a great song selection, it's very disappointing that a cellphone is required. For a game that's about dancing, it's frustrating that you can't play just using a camera, despite the fact that this feature was available in previous editions (the PS5  is backwards compatible with the ps4 camera so why wasn't this feature programmed in?) Also, the physical box doesn't even come with a disc. With digital making content obsolete, there is no ownership of games now."
2,D Pad sucks,"cant hold any cardinal direction without going hitting a diagonal.  controller is cheap and feels good, thats about the only upside."
5,Nice inexpensive headset!,This headset is a great deal! I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the look and feel given the low price. My son needed a new gaming headset and these will be a perfect Christmas gift for him!!
5,christmas present,Daughter has been unable to get it to work. She thinks it's just a calibration problem.
5,loads of fun,"Given as a Christmas gift, the boys love it. They are age 5 and six.they received the x-box kinnect from Santa and have played the games a lot. Thanks for another great game for the younger children"
1,One of the worst games I've ever played,"This is not a review because I'm a new player and the game is too hard. I am a high level player of these NHL games and after a full week of playing and giving it countless chances, I can say that this is one of the worst games of all time. The features are amazing. I love how in depth the game is. But the gameplay itself is beyond pure garbage. The opposing AI will never ever be off your player. They can read exactly where you're going and make turns as you make them. Physics means nothing to the opposing AI while your AI is a joke. Passing feels completely random and don't even bother using stick lift. It doesn't work. The AI has a recovery time of zero while you get held down by unrealistic physics. I can't even begin to explain how frustrating it is. I like things to be difficult. I don't want to easily win every game. Losing games is good because that means the challenge is there. But I cannot deal with feeling cheated because of how unfair the game is. Winning even feels bad because the experience is so frustrating. EA is awful and I cannot stress enough that no one should waste their money on this horrible game."
5,"Engaging storyline, great graphics, can be very taxing!","If you thought X-Wing vs. TIE was good, you'll love this. You play the role of the son of a family caught up in the Rebellion. You start by flying missions for your family business. Eventually you can join the Rebellion  and fly X-wings, A-wings, B-wings, and you even get the chance to fly the  Millennium Falcon! The range of missions is great, and you can practise  your skills in the simulator, or the pilot proving grounds. My only  criticism is that some of the early missions are very tricky, and the  difficulty does not always seem to increase in logical order."
1,One Star,Nunca logró llegar
1,USB Ports are incredibly tight and gutted one of my cords,"The USB ports are super tight and it's very difficult to insert cables. Upon removing a cable from one of the USB Ports, the entire innards of the port were pulled out and rendered one of my cables useless."
5,Chill with the hate,"I don't see what all the hate is about. I'm really pleased with WW2; graphics are beautiful, gameplay is excellent. COD games always come out with a bunch of negative reviews because of course there will be some bugs and glitches. Yes, the MP servers were down a lot the first few days, but now they're fine. There are a few other annoying things, like getting kicked back to the main screen after a match is over, but those will be fixed. The thing to focus on is whether or not you like the gameplay. There's no double jumping or jet packs, no lasers in space - it feels very gritty and real, and not everyone will enjoy that, but I sure do."
5,Great addictive game if you are into 8bit games,"Great addictive game if you are into 8bit games, i have been on luigis mansion, pokemon saphire, and on smashbrothers but lately ive been on this game all day. The more you play the more content you unlock the game is easy to paly but I have trouble on Dr. Mario so far I have not unlocked everything the speed mario is really hard since its like playing in turbo mode, I recommend this to anyone who use to play the nes system."
1,Not again...,"Another Bethesda offering, another crash filled bug-fest. What is wrong with this company? Less than an hour in and the game has crashed 5 times. For God sakes Bethesda, it isn't even a new game. You had 5 years to fix these problems.  Maybe this is my fault for trusting a company with such a checkered history on the PlayStation. Do yourself a favor and pass on this cash grab."
5,You cannot live without this game,"Do you like Age of Empires, but wish it were a little more complex? Do you wish that you could have intense wars at some times, but at other times focus on developing your culture and economy, and keeping your citizens happy? Do you wish that diplomatic relations were more complex than just giving tribute? Then this game is for you! This is easily the best real-time strategy game I have played. I does take a day or so to learn how to play. But it's completely worth it. Runs great on Vista, but remember to update the drivers for your video card for best results. The instruction booklet is on the DVD, but you can print it out. Comes with a cool map of the world that is actually helpful for the game."
5,Ready to drive,For a budget steering wheel this is good. However YOU NEED A DATA CABLE. Use the one it comes with or look for a micro USB cable that has data transfer abilities. ITS A MUST HAVE!!! Over all the steering is great buttons feel good. Paddles have a nice click. Also the set up is easy.
5,Five Stars,The best way to play basketball without sweating.
1,Ridiculous,"it costs almost as much as the system itself. Sony can go screw themselves. why can't SanDisk make a cheaper version of this? Seriously, Sony needs to stop gouging the consumer"
5,"Best sandbox, possibly ever!","This game is a split between GTA4, Saints Row, and something all its own. It has the graphics only better'd by GTA4(but not much), the tons of weapons and fast paced action of SR with none of the bad. The only thing I can say is GTA4 has better gun and driving contols and physics; but this game trades that off with better flying and much more fun! The vast area is really impressive. I mean it make Oblivion look like tiny, GTA 4 look small, and I mean I've played for 4 hours now and seen maybe half of the island... By a jet. I feel like I can't even properly review it. 400 square miles of great graphics, changing weather and millions of opions. I highly recomend this game. Over anything else out right now. Its so much FUN!!!"
1,Beware - game may or may not work.,"I am running Windows 7 on a 64 bit machine. I have been trying to get this game to run for about 2 hours. I have installed, patched, uninstalled, reinstalled, and repatched. It hangs on the loading screen. I looked in the forums, and my problem is not uncommon with 64-bit windows 7. Maybe they will release a patch to make it work? I own and have played every other Heroes of Might and Magic game. I love these games and an very sad that this one is so broken."
5,"Super pink, super cute!","Uses USB type C plug-in! The switch charger is the same size, so I use my switch charger wire to charge my controller too!"
5,Great buy for my ps4 controller,"Doesn't show it charging on screen but it does work really well. I love the length of the wire and so does my cat, but its great to whip it from one side of my bed to the other to get it away from him. Actually locks into controller and ps4, all the other ones I have were too short and slipped out of place way to often, can actually lay in bed while playing instead of sitting on the edge hoping it doesn't pop out. Great buy and shipped fast."
5,Soooooo Quiet.... I LOVE THIS,"I love the value, especially for 2 of them. The design is also very nice.  The thing I love the most is that it is soooooo quiet. You don't even hear the clicks like other mouses."
5,Asian dynasties - A sweet addition,"Well i dont want to spoil anyone by giving out too many details about China, India and Japan. ill just say that 3 new nations are unique, fun and easy to play with. All have specific only to them cards, wonders, military units.  The artists at Big Huge Games did a great job of capturing the unique building structures for the new factions too. They all share similar economic tree but have elemets that distinct them like Japan can't hunt but has Cherry Orchard, and its houses serve as shrines that attract wild animals and generate  3 different resources one ata time. India cant kill cows from lifestock  but uses them to gather Export, a new resource which you can spend to buy  some units from Consulate where you ally with European nations. Each new side has own strategy it can implement. India relies heavily on Elephants, China on its Banner Army. Its very fun, voice acting of villagers is excellent and amuzing as always so its really a joy to listen villagers speak back on new languages. Graphics are passable, they are a bit oldy compared to some other rts games on the market but the gameplay is what counts.  Its a rare and generous package of new visuals, new gameplay, and absolutely crucial improvements to the core game. If you weren't an Age III fan before Asian Dynasties, get ready to be one now.  A good title for fans, worth buying for those hoping for a reinvigoration of the series."
2,If you like hair trigger games,"This game is beautiful. The music is soothing. It's a maze or puzzle game, no battling or killing enemies (that I have found so far). I guess some people would say it's challenging, but I consider a challenge to be something that might be difficult to figure out, but do-able once you figure out the sequence or proper procedure, or whatever. But this game has points where your movements have to be correct to less than a millimeter, or you will have to start the section over. It's not challenging, it's frustrating. A switch controller doesn't have the precision that is needed for this game. Your have to time jumps to the most finely tuned timing and exact landing points. I enjoy maze and puzzle style games, and was looking for an enjoyable laid back adventure game, but the frustration that comes with the exact precision needed in this game is frustrating. There is no music or art soothing enough to make up for the frustration level. I'm 43 years old. I can't imagine the tears or tantrums if I have this to one of my kids to play. There is zero forgiveness in this game. So, I guess if you like games where your movements must be refined and timed to a millimeter, and you like the stress of having to get long sequences of movements done using those precision, and if you are ok with starting over every time you make the slightest misstep, then maybe this game is ok for you."
5,This thing worked perfect!,Large capacity...had a ton of great utilities on it.  Booted right up with no fiddling.
5,Saves the ankles!,I'm no longer an ankle shooter...I have found that coming around corners I'd be aiming at peoples ankles. With this product I'm no longer shooting off peoples ankles.
4,Nice controller,I like the controller. Only thing I don't like is the wire is not as long as my other remote. Other then that is works great. Update the buttons kept getting stuck so I stopped using it.
1,A little disappointing,"After watching all the hype, I eagerly awaited the August 14th release of Madden 08. I bought the game for PC the day it was released and right away I had problems with it. The installation went well, but then '08 would not run (""Security Module could not be activated:7001""). After an hour I finally found a fix by deleting some registry files. Expecting something close to the XBox 360 or PS3 version of '08, I was saddened to see the same menu screen as last year's Madden 07 PC version. I played several games and noticed very few differences from last year's PC version. Like anothre review said, the roster s were updated and there were 1 or 2 new graphical tweaks, but for the most part I felt like was playing Madden 07. Player movements are still slightly awkward and there are some clipping issues. A lot of hyped features like gang-tackling are noticeably absent from Madden 08 PC. I've played Madden 08 on the XBox360 and I gotta say the console version is way smoother and much more entertaining. If you have an option, skip the PC version of Madden 08 and go with the Xbox 360 or PS3 version."
5,A sweet uplifting movie.,"Chances Are portrays the power of love and understanding in a comedic way. If you love good old sentimental movies with a splash of comedy, as well as a great soundtrack, check out Chances Are! Soundtrack includes Cher and  Peter Cetera singing that popular and beautiful song After All, as well as  Johnny Mathis' Chances Are and Rod Stewart's Forever Young."
1,junk!!!,Piece of junk. Broke first time i used it. Was able to play two games only before it literally fell apart.
1,Video cable damaged!!,"I couldn't play my PS3 for a few weeks because my HD tv wasn't available so i trusted on the regular video cable, but oh surprise it didn't work, it wasn't the cable itself but the cable video port in the PS3 ! I don't live in the US so there was no way for me to exchange my PS3 for a new one, a few weeks later I got my HD tv back and I could play with my PS3 using the HD cable"
5,Great for Builders,I must have for people who have the switch.
5,works great,We bought Wii Sing It for our three kids for Christmas.  I'd read reviews stating that some of the microphones available did not work right with this game.  Several reviews stated that the Logitech USB microphone worked right and that is absolutely correct.  We plugged it in and away it went!  Our kids are ages 8 and 9 and they sing duet with the Sing It game.  We've never had any problems and they love it.
1,One Star,The system didnt come with a controller or the hd cable it said it would come with both and now it doesnt work at all
1,"Arrived defective, will update later","Ordered the 500GB gears bundle with Destiny: Taken King. It arrived with bent casing around the disc drive, and the disc drive doesn't read discs at all. Very disappointing. I'll update this review when my replacement arrives, but I wish I didn't have to go through the hassle."
5,"It is actually a very fun game, some dumb humor but we enjoy it","My husband has tried to get me to play video games with him for years to no avail. I told him I'd play a Harry Potter game, but was skeptical when he bought the Lego collection. It is actually a very fun game, some dumb humor but we enjoy it. Would be great for kids too!"
2,Mic Picks Up Too Much Ambient Noise,"The sound is great on these. I'm using them with my PS4. My only gripe is the mic picks up too much ambient noise. My friends all hear my air conditioner but if I switch back to my Astro's, they don't hear anything besides my voice. Not sure if I'm doing something wrong but because of that, I have to knock off 3 stars as using these for gaming was the main reason for my purchase and it's not a good experience so far."
5,Five Stars,I actually purchased these to use on my sewing machine screen. Works good
5,Awesome game. I enjoyed the old Kings Quest years ...,"Awesome game. I enjoyed the old Kings Quest years ago. The graphics on this are very nice. And the play is great fun. I'm not much of a gamer, but this is cool. I run it on Windows 10. ---- Added after completing the game. ----- The only problem is needing to install a program named Steam to get and run the Kings Quest game. Steam is a problem. It constantly updates itself and it runs in the background full time. It then does not uninstall and must be manually removed from the system. Very troublesome."
4,Pretty Good,"If you have played the original Army Men: Sarge's Heroes, you will probably like this one.  Although it is relatively the same, this one seemed somewhat easier than the original.  The levels continue to get harder as they come along, but most don't seem to offer the same challenge.  I have had it for less than a week and am three levels away from beating it.  If you are an experienced player and are looking for a game that will take a long time to beat, this isn't the game for you."
1,THIS IS TRASH AND A RIPOFF!!!!!!,"No games work with this, the rowing machine itself has no resistance, it is a total ripoff piece of junk. DO NOT BUY"
5,Extraordinary design and perfect performance!,"I was astonished by its extraordinary design when I unwrapped the package. The cool lights on the box and earbuds make the product more high-tech feelings. The earbuds perfectly fit my gaming computer. I am also satisfied with its fast and wireless charging, which eliminates my concern on its power when I play video games."
5,Pretty Awesome Demo,I got the demo for FFX the other day and I just keep playing it over and over. The battle system with the ability to be the Aeons is awesome and if you have a hard time against an enemy just switch characters to someone who can deal with it. You can also swim in the water and under it. Blitzball just looks incredibly awesome. And the voices are really darn good. The only thing I didn't like was how much Tidus whined but that's only a minor thing in my case. The graphics are flawless and the music is great. Overall I think this is definately going to be the best final fantasy yet. But I guess you already figured that.
4,My eight year old enjoyed it.,I bought this game for my eight year old son and he thoroughly enjoyed it.  The only thing I noticed is that he played through all the levels really quickly.  So the game is pretty short.  He goes back and replay the levels so for him it is okay.
1,PARENT ALERT,"We bought this game because we enjoy the other Lego games (Star Wars and Indiana Jones). We have now thrown this game away because in order to unlock certain parts of the game you are forced to play a villain. As a villain there are parts where you are attacking and killing police officers. Being a police officer, I was very upset when my husband showed this to me. I am very disappointed in this game."
5,"A memorable, substance filled masterpiece.","This was probably one of the the top 10 games I have ever played as far as the storytelling and atmosphere go. DO NOT listen to these malicious idiots leaving one star reviews! Exodus, should you choose to play it as it is meant to be played - slowly, taking in everything, rather than like some COD style shooter - will amaze you at moments and terrify you at others. A mix of Fallout, STALKER, and Uncharted, Metro:Exodus spits in the face of those who claim single player games are dead. If you want a game which never ends and is basically a glorified time-waster, this game is not for you. But, if you are looking for a game with a captivating story, an atmosphere that can at times be either comparatively gorgeous or chillingly scary, characters who you can genuinely relate to and care for, and lore to the moon, then Metro: Exodus is your game. Is it perfect? No, as no game is. Is it remarkably fresh and entertaining in a sea of dry, same old-same old games? Absolutely! tl,dr: BUY IT, CYKA!"
1,WATCH OUT,Requires Direct X 11. I have 12. Wouldn't run. Tried grand-son's old X-box. Still no go. No refund. Probably why it's so cheap.
2,Damaged goods.,"Normally I don't do reviews but on the rare occasion, it's never a good one. I figured what the hell, buy a game off amazon, they make sure their products are delivered safe and intact. But when the case is clearly shattered at the bottom as I open up the package and pieces fall out, I have major reason to worry. Disc looks slightly warped, gonna test it to make sure it works. Expect an update within the next 24 hours."
1,Crap.,Lame. 343i released a completely broken game. Multiplayer is too buggy to connect to other players. Single player doesn't save your progress. Avoid this game until they fix it. At least two plus months.
4,Highly addictive,"This game is so deep and so detailed that I've found it incredibly addictive. It can be a bit intimidating at first but once you figure a few things out its ridiculously fun. I've had no problems running it on my machine, which is new."
5,Great bang for you buck.,"Pretty good product for the price. Battery fits snugly into the controller and stays put. Battery only stays in base while attached to the controller. Overall, my son is pretty happy with this purchase since he burns through so many batteries."
5,This looks so kool!!!!!!,"This game looks so kool. the first one was a huge hit, and the expansion packs made it way, way better, i like superstar the best. this looks so kool, i hear you can have like 4 floors and stuff. This looks like it will be 5 times better than the regular 1rst sims.you would think,"" How much better can they get?"" well i am guessing that we will be suprised. i also hope that they work on graphics and sounds. i can't wait any longer till' this comes out. I heard a rumor that there is going to be a crapload of expansions for the second sims, although, i really can't think of much they could do, they have covered a lot. Besides School, and...... well, that is all i can think of. I guess we will have to just wait and see how electronic arts will suprise or please us next."
2,Not compatible with Guitar Hero 2!,Loved it until we bought the sequel. The fret buttons only work on the original game. Ouch!
5,Got the NES working great!,So far so good. Hooked it up and it works right out of the box. What a life saver this find was!!!
5,Leave your dock at home!,"We bought this for a spring break trip to grandma's house. Worked perfectly. It allowed the children to take over the big TV and play Switch games together without fighting. Well, not fighting about having to take turns.... I didn't realize that attaching the AC cord was mandatory (thought maybe it could run on the battery), but luckily my phone charger was able to pinch hit. I'm excited that we don't have to mount our dock to use the Switch on the go."
4,Works pretty good besides the disc tray.,"System runs pretty good, only issue with it is it makes a noise when opening the disc tray. Not a big issue though noticing I tested my old one that I recently cleaned up (Not being renewed) and it also makes the same noise. Other than that, the system is fine and works how I expected it too."
5,"Great product, great price","I really love my Switch Lite, but I noticed when I played for longer period of time, it got uncomfortable to hold. That is the primary reason that I purchased this particular case. The case makes the Switch much more comfortable to hold, especially when I play for extended periods of time. It fits snugly and was not too difficult to put on. It comes off fairly easily as well. I have not used the screen protectors that were included because I already have one on my Switch, but I thought that was a nice bonus that they were included. Overall, I am completely satisfied with this product."
5,Wow!  A sleeper hit!,"I downloaded the demo version of this on a lark 'cause it sounded kind of funny.  What a surprise I got when my girlfriend and I both loved playing it.  In fact, we've been taking turns playing it for two straight days now.  I've called all around trying to get my hands on the full version and everyone in my area is sold out.  The last person I talked to at one of the EB's said the game is being highly sought after by many.  I guess a lot of folks found the demo as much fun as we did.  I can't wait to get my hands on the full version.  Great job jaleco!  Hope to see more good stuff in the future!"
5,"Great device, Terrible software.",The device itself its great but the software they expect you to use is terrible.  I use OBS instead.
5,A classic point and click adventure reborn.,A classic point and click adventure reborn. I played the demo and loved it. You can tell it was a labor of love. I chose to buy the physical version over the download. Owning the tangible copy of any game always beats the download. Amazon Prime got it to me quickly and for a very reasonable price. Would buy again.
1,Always on DRM that doesn't even work,"I was really excited about this. I really wanted to like it. I was even willing to tolerate the smaller city borders. But waiting 2 hours to get through only for it to crash again, losing cities because of server problems in SINGLE PLAYER game. That is too much. This was a waste of money. Play Cities XL. Play SimCity 4 with mods. Skip SimCity 5."
1,They weren't prepared,I find it pretty sad that people are still having a hard time getting these. It's pathetic actually
1,Does NOT work with the New Xbox S as stated on the packaging.,"Does NOT work with the New Xbox S as stated on the packaging. The pins do not line up, nor does the locking mechanism. This is the 3rd different brand I have tried stating that it works for the new X Or S and they clearly do not."
5,Great quality and good features at a budget price. Well deserving of its excellent reviews.,"I purchased this product based on the excellent reviews and it being ranked as one of the best in its class. Still, I was ready to be disappointed as it just didn't cost enough to be good enough. Well, I am NOT disappointed. Everything about this keyboard is as claimed. While one of the drawbacks mentioned in the reviews was the keys not being mechanical, they are smooth and quiet and I just can't fault that. What I was really interested in was a lighted keyboard and this keyboard more than fits the bill for what I was looking for and the quality for the price can't be beat. All-in-all I'm very happy with it."
1,They are no good,"I purchased 2 extra chargers for my 6 year olds D3S, for just in case the orginial one was misplaced (LOST).  Once i had to use them neither of them worked.  What's the chances of getting 2 chargers that don't work?"
5,Five Stars,Awesome game!
5,NANCY DREW GAMES,"Although my kids haven't played this particular Nancy Drew game before, I would just like to express how very impressed I am with these PC games.  In many cases PC games are overrated.  However, in this case these quality games are clean, fun, and well worth the price."
5,Great buy for the money.,They fit snug into my phone and ps4 controller and they're durable.
5,Great keyboard!,It works perfectly and is a breeze to type on. I like the customizable backlighting.
4,Good Game. A bit easy.,Bought this for my son since he likes the Spore Universe PC game. This is a fun game and has far more action than the PC version. The graphics are fantastic as well. The only problem is he solved the game in 2 days!
5,A great party game...,"With the increase in music based games (Rockband, Guitar Hero) I didn't really think this would have much to offer, considering it is only singing, but I was wrong. I found the game to be highly entertaining. The song list is pretty decent and at the time of its release there were 151 downloadable songs. I suggest if you do get it buy an additional microphone (Rockband and Guitar Hero mics work) as it will allow you to play against another person, or groups of two against groups of two in duets battle. For people in my family who care less about videogames and having not only played it, but enjoyed it, it tells you the game is pretty entertaining. If you are a fan of karaoke, singing in the shower or while driving, this game will rock your socks off. It's pure simple fun for all ages. I highly recommend it as a party game or solo. Worth every cent."
5,Oh man,"Let me start by saying that I haven't played a F1 game since 2011 so I don't know much about how much content is missing and all that stuff. What I do know us that thus game is great, the graphics are awesome, AI are a little bit more challenginformation than 2011 and the driving feels nice. The graphics are Way better than what the pictures show even when driving you can notice almost everything like detail on the asphalt, the blades of grass that get stuck to the tires when you drive into a patch of grass, and my favorite parts are the cockpits and pit stops, Oh man do I love the pit stop cinematics when they take off the tires and you can see the detail on the tires of damage and other stuff like that. Anyway I lo e this game I can't stop playing it but the only thing I would like them to add is the option to do a warmup lap before the race starts that would be nice. I felt like writing this review to recommend this game to other people since I cone from a Mexican-American family and there aren't that many F1 fans in these types of families just soccer and NASCAR so anyways get this game it's beautiful nice but the other thing I wasn't to crazy about was the engine sound but I guess thats how the been engines sound this year."
5,Better than expected,"I have had this mouse for about 2 months now and when I first got it out the box I thought it was going to preform badly because of the build. It felt light and cheap (probably because it is cheap) but they were not cheap with the performance. I'm used to the feel of the mouse now and it is an amazing mouse for the price, if you want something wireless but don't have enough money for a ""high"" end mouse this is right for you. I say ""high"" end because it preforms really well and see little to no difference between them, only cons I see is that the software is weird but I don't mess with it and also their is no way to tell your DPI like I can with my other mouse where each DPI has a different color. You will have to start from the slowest and count to the correct DPI."
1,NO CARTRIDGE!,Was soooo excited to receive this in mail but when I opened the package there was no game cartridge..VERY disappointed...
1,Greed.,"This game is a complete cash grab, contains an immense amount of paywalls and has a free to play model built into it. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME AND SUPPORT THESE GREEDY COMPANIES. The myplayer is built around the gamer pouring hundreds of dollars because the grind is so ridiculous, with the difficulty being increased no matter the setting(they removed rookie difficulty in myplayer just to make sure you have more trouble with everything, as well as pro feeling like hall of fame with zero multipliers on bonuses). You will miss layups, wide open shots even when you have your mid range or 3pt maxed out. This is a blatant scam on the consumer, and I implore you to never support this kind of business practices."
4,Mom made me do it.,"Face it, kids play a lot of video games.  When I think my kid is goofing off too much - it's ""the educational game or none at all"" - she'll play and will keep playing long after she's passed ""for at least a half hour"" mark."
5,Perfect Protection,Wanted something simple to protect my switch when gaming. It fits perfectly and snug and the price point was just right.
1,"Worst COD yet.,","Save your money. I just finished playing it and it is by far the worst COD I have ever played. The campaign is terrible. Im tired of all this futuristic crap. Go back to wars, terrorism and taking down tyrants. I feel like I am playing COD: Halo edition anymore. This was crap."
1,Messed up my system.,"I was really excited for the idea of a cheaper dock than the official one, so I could use my switch on multiple tv's.  After using this a handful of times, my switch stopped displaying on my tv.  I thought the dock itself was just broken, but then I tried my switch in my official Nintendo dock.  Nothing, doesn't charge either.  Pretty sure this thing jacked up the USB C port. I'm furious, now I have to go through the hassle of having Nintendo fix it.  Not happy."
1,No Cockpit View,They removed one of the features that they helped become a standard in modern simulation racing games.  No cockpit view sadly means i'll be moving away from dirt 2 and likely all codemasters racing games in the future.
2,no longer playable,this is an online game. it is no longer playable.  do not buy this and expect to play it.
1,BUGGED OUT DUMPSTER FIRE,"The product itself, showed up on time, the item was in good condition but the game itself, never should have been released and I wish I could get my money back.  Just a downright terrible game."
4,Good 1st Fishing game,"This is an interesting twist from the creators of Deer Avenger. Normally I don't care for fishing games but I thought what's the harm in trying something new. It is so cool! Funny dialogue, hysterical lures to get the fisherman in. Kinda hard the first couple of times since I have never played a fishing game before but gets much easier as you learn the ropes. I hope Bass Avenger 2 is half as good as the first."
5,6 Year Old in Heaven.,"This is a nice game for little kids who like dinosaurs. It has a bunch of mini games and you need to earn ""digging points"" to get more dinos and games. So far my 6yr old boy loves this game. No reading required for game play. Easy to learn and grow in difficulty. I even want to play some of the mini games. Scholastic finally put this on the DS and it is cool. According to the masses ""I am the coolest mom ever"". Enough Said!"
5,Awsome,I got the kinect for Christmas and LOVE it!!  I have a small row in Philadelpia and all the questions about not having enough space is not that big of an issue.  I did take it up to my in-laws in upstate Pennsylvania and everyone loved it!! It was so easy to operate that even the older generation had no trouble playing it. Can't wait for new titles to come out though. Now does anyone wanna buy my out of date WII? LOL!
5,Love it!!,As advertised!  The model is 7216b.  Shipped and arrived as promised!  Have it set up and love it!!!
5,Great fan for the price,"Super simple to install- pops right on the back.  The USB cord needs to plug into the FRONT of the machine, and the cord is JUST long enough to reach around with a little slack.  The USB cord is not removable.  Function- It works great! Nice and quiet, and our PS4's fan was always sounding like a jet about to take off! With this fan, the works stay cooler and the fan stays quiet.  Also- there's an auto or manual mode for the unit.  We leave it on auto, so it turns on when the motor gets warmer than 32 degrees C.  Great fan!"
1,too buggy,"would be a great game if it worked but like all bethesda games it's too big to work and is full of bugs.  it took me 3 starts to have the game initiate properly, characters will not respond so you're stuck not being able to complete missions. companions will get lost or just become unresponsive.  sometimes the dialogue text appears but the characters do not talk or respond. hugely disappointing."
1,Terrible,This is the worst DS game ever. Don't waste your money on this game. This is a luck and guessing game and it has nothing to do with math. The instructions are pretty poor. The formulate section does not even work. The makers of this game need to pull it off the shelves and fix it.
1,Worked fine... at first.,"The product was received in excellent working condition. However, after about 2 weeks the nunchuck became incredibly unresponsive. I have been forced to unplug it whenever I notice my controls start to ""stick"" or become unresponsive. I have no choice but to contact Nintendo's support in order to setup an RMA."
4,"first pokemon game i played since red, yellow and blue","I only give it 4 stars for one reason. I liked in the original games how when you find wild Pokemon, you fight them and then try to catch them if you want. In this you just try to catch them or run away. I think there is a sword and shield pokemon game for switch as well that is more old school in that you fight the wild pokemon when you encounter them. You do fight pokemon in this still obviously but only with the trainers you run into while you are getting all the badges and what not. Very cute game with nice graphics."
5,"Great game, evolving, but what online game isnt?????","This game looks like it will be the game to beat in the online game battlefield.  Sure, it has its problems, but what online game didnt' start out.  How dim witted and forgetful some people are that are quick to belittle this game.  Everquest started out very buggy when it was released, but is now the top rated online game.  I predict that WWII online will do that and more.  The developers have many more features left that are not yet implimented, but will be someday in the near future.  Absolutely a blast to play, a must buy, but would suggest waiting a month or so for the bugs to be squashed and features to be implimented, if you have a short attention span."
4,Changing a review...,"My apologies, for any confusion my original review, may have caused. This game is fun and does play great. However, for some odd reason my TV cannot go to 1080p when I change the resolution settings. It claims the ""mode is not supported"". However my monitor works at 1080p. I can only blame the poor coding to the game, as EVERY PC game I play on my TV works perfectly fine at 1080p. It's a known cause, but no support to actually fix the issue has become available. I'm afraid a change in review is in order and I have to take a star. But mainly to fix a complaint towards my poor choice of wording."
4,Don't be fooled by the word Complete,"Let it be known that I love this game, however my one problem with it is the way it markets itself.  This one problem is enough to get rid of a star.  When I bought this game, I was expecting all the DLC, however you still need to purchase a few packs to get all of the DLC released for this game.  Off the top of my head, you still need the Super Teams Pack, Horns Pack, Ken Block Special Pack and the Colin McRae Charity Pack.  That will set you back around 15 dollars.  So in all, you are paying 55 dollars for a product that leads you into thinking it is 40.  Again, I love this game, its one of my favorite all time PS3 racing games along with Gran Turismo 5, but the misleading title is what makes this a 4 star product.  5 star game, 4 star product"
5,OH.....MY......GOD:THIS IS SO COOOOL!,"This game makes RCT even more enjoyable with new attractions like miniature golf and a ghost train with undergroung sections! You can even build a suspended monorail!  There are 30 new scenarios. you can start  your park that it partially built, futuristic, or long-neglected. Also, you  can paint individual parts of you ride. And, there are about 20 new shops  such as: candy apple stall, hat stall, sea food stall, hot dog stall,  and... you can even build a mall!  And to top it all off, there are new  rides such as, a river ride with large capacity boats, circus tent, side  friction roller coaster, heartline rollercoaster, steel and wooden twister  rollercoaster with giant loops, virginia reel rollercoaster, steel wild  mouse rollercoaster, log flume with turntable, miniature train with covered  cars, a roto-drop and much much more. I higly suggest you buy this game.  You will be crying with overwhelmedness over all the excitment!"
4,I have only one complaint,"I bought a Kinect mostly so I could play the dance games for a little extra exercise to hopefully rid me of my slightly chunky thighs. I ended up buying several games for it along with the three it came with. So far it has worked almost perfectly with each game. I think it's great that it can track my movement so I can be interactive with the games rather than just sitting their pressing buttons on a controller while drooling down the front of my shirt. I also like that I can select options by a swipe of my hand through the air so I don't have to be attached to a controller while playing. I only have one complaint. While playing Just Dance 3 and other games, I noticed that the Kinect seemed to have a mind of its own and was selecting songs and options even when I wasn't moving. I realized after moving out of the screen altogether that it was picking up my cat sleeping on the couch behind me, even though my cat wasn't moving other than breathing. It sometimes counts my sleeping cat as another player and turns what should have been a solo dance into a partner dance, in which, obviously, my cat does not score well. Now, if my cat could get up and dance with me, I would be very happy and have lots of funny videos to post on the internet, but it can't, so I don't like that the Kinect picks it up as a player, especially when it's just sleeping behind me. Why can't its sensors just pick up things that are human-shaped? Now, I try to keep my cats out of the way, but that's not always easy because they have these four little things called legs.  Sometimes I notice when no one (not even my cat) is in the screen with me, the Kinect will still seem to have a mind of its own and select things while I'm not moving. Sometimes it scrolls up and down jerkily through the song selection when I'm standing still or even out of the screen completely.  I discovered it was picking up a  throw blanket that was behind me (moving it out of the way made the Kinect stop scrolling on its own), a foot stool, and another time it picked up the corner of a computer chair.  I don't know why it does this when the items are not moving or even remotely human. This messes up my game play at times and it's very annoying. I think maybe it's too sensitive and acting like a drama queen. That said, I still love my Kinect and I'm happy to have it. It has made playing video games more fun for me. I usually only played Left 4 Dead 2, Halo: Reach, and Borderlands, but now I play more of a variety of games and don't get fat doing it. Sometimes it feels good to take a break from shooting things and stand up and do the Carlton instead."
5,Meets or exceeds description.,Product came on time and per description. Batteries maintain play time as described in description. Comes with a unique dual micro-usb to single USB. Batteries are snug but not difficult to install. Remember as per instructions use micro-usb on battery and not controller to charge. Overall good price point for item and functions as described. Will repurchase a backup set later.
5,Great value!,"Rough start but they made it right , loving the product!"
4,Works Great,Works well with dragon speech
1,"Couldn't use it, does not start up","After reading online, it seems I got one of the many PS4 with boot problems; and I thought that not buying an early PS4 would avoid any inconvenience with it because of sony and their desire to launch their console first, without being ready"
1,There's literally nothing to do in this game. Barely ...,"There's literally nothing to do in this game.  Barely any clothes, furniture, homes!  After just an hour, I did all I could do.  The ONLY improvement is faster home building.  But even thats kinda eh."
5,Good controller,I like the gold color which is why I originally bought this. It also holds the charge longer than the controller that came with the system!
1,Does not work,"Took nearly a month to get this, and it doesn't work."
5,"Great, clear case! Fits in dock!","Fits very well and still fits in the dock!! I might recommend getting a screen protector because it fits in the dock quite snugly but it still definitely fits! The case feels comfortable and was easy to put on, very clear and shiny! Love it"
1,No Ultrawide support,What year is it? This game doesn't fit or run right on my ultrawide monitor.
5,Don't listen to the trolls,"This is strictly for Google Play games and cloud streaming... And for what's it's built for, it does EXTREMELY WELL! Yes, cloud gaming and streaming isn't perfect 'yet' but it's pretty darn close and this is the best setup I've tried for on the go gaming. As long as you have a decent WiFi connection or a mobile hotspot you can connect to, you're good to go! I cannot recommend this enough. Both me and my wife have one and absolutely love them! What are you reading this for anymore?! If you're that interested, but one already!!!"
5,Worked for me!,"Used this set of tools and a pocket-knife to replace the faulty cd drive in my Wii. I am the type of guy that usually runs into three problems fixing one, it was enjoyable having exactly the tool I needed at hand when I needed it! Operation was a success, Wii once again reads game discs!"
1,Let down,One of the joycons had a big crack on the back and both were pretty dirty. Just go ahead and buy new ones.
1,Toe Brakes Broke,Toe brake springs broke after very light use
2,the PC User-interface remains terrible. While some people defend it,"Even after the second update, the PC User-interface remains terrible.  While some people defend it, the game's user-interface is significantly worse than the previous two games.  I understand that the content is supposedly superior to the second game, and on par with the first, but I for one cannot overcome how terrible the controls and camera are to actually enjoy those features.  Frankly, it's a joke that this game gets so many awards, since it's a clear step back in progress from other games."
5,Nice,Very happy with the purchase and the speedy delivery
2,Not the best.,Would like to say the grips felt nice until I put on the knuckle straps. The knuckle straps make you hold the controller unnaturally and i barley can tighten them and i saw decent looking  tearing happening at the bottom loops. Id look elsewhere tbh.
2,Very Disappointing,"I was having a conversation with a friend of mine recently and mentioned that with the revolutionary gesture control possibilities with the Wii, it should be worth getting a Wii just for Avatar.  Unfortunately, gestures from the show aren't really employed.  Furthermore, I'm a fan of the show and the game doesn't follow anything that makes sense in the show's storyline whatsoever.  I was looking forward to traveling the world mastering the elements as Ang in my living room making the gestures myself, but it just doesn't work out that way.  In my opinion the game would probably have been more fun 10 years ago and for someone that hadn't seen the show.  The Wii is still great, however."
5,Plug and Play,"Works great! The Wii had been sitting downstairs unused. I was a little worried that it might not work on our TV. We have a 65"" OLED LG TV and it looks great!"
4,Fun if you can only use one hand,"This is a fun addition to the rhythm games even if it's a bit awkward and doesn't necessarily sit well on your lap. Only having the parts for the right hand is a little disappointing but, until the new guitars arrive, it's the closest you get to playing a real instrument."
5,"Sounds great, feels great, highly recommend!","I love these! They go with my RGB Mac setup super well. They're super comfortable and have huge ear cups. Like, huge. I was kind of shocked when I pulled them out of the box because they're so big. The in-line volume adjuster feels a little cheap, but that aside, the headphones feel super great! They have a nice gloss finish."
5,Originally disappointed. Incredibly pleased.,"When I first received this I was slightly disappointed. It seemed very flimsy. However, once placed on the device it feels amazing. I only ever use my switch in handheld mode. This makes it feel like a true handheld console and takes away the flimsy feeling the joycons had. I hope that someday they come out with more colors for it. Keep in mind, this won't fit in the dock with the case on. However, it's easy to remove the case. Again, I can't stress enough that this is primarily for people like myself who only use the switch in portable mode."
1,Buy OEM,"Cheap, CHEAP plastic snaps broke while playing.  Dropped headset.  Broke headset.  Lesson learned."
4,Will take a simple modification by cutting the bottom with razor to charge.,"Bought this because it looked comfortable and said it's dockable. It is NOT dockable. Also it put a lot of tension on your joycons putting the switch in it, with all that said I took a razor and cut the bottom section off so it would seat in the dock and that also would free up the tension putting switch in and out. After I was done with the simple modification to this product it charges just fine in dock so theres no need to take it off unless you wanna clean switch or take joycons off. I still recommend this because the quality of the product is well made but beware you will have to do a simple modification for it to charge and doing so also makes it easier to take switch in and out for whatever reason."
1,They treat it like a free to play game even though we pay ...,This game has so much potential but Ubisoft wants to see how much they can pee on their customers by not having dedicated servers and having things cost way too much in game. They treat it like a free to play game even though we pay full price for it. I spent more time sitting at the loading screen than playing and a majority of matches drop halfway through and you get nothing from the match. I really loved the concept but save your money until they get their stuff together and make the game more stable.
1,You'll have to wait for any multiplayer game,"My old AOM was getting all scratched up and I was interested in getting the expansion.  So, I purchased this package from Valusoft.  After installing it, I kept getting the message ""CD Key cannot be validated...""  I thought it might have been some software conflict.  So I uninstalled my old version of AOM with the new one.  No success.  Got the same message.  So I it was a software issue and I followed the instructions by waiting a few minutes before relogging.  No success.  After a few hours, I researched online to learn that Valusoft sent the same product key codes to all its customers.  This makes multiplayer game play impossible.  Not only can I NOT play the Titans, since that key has been long gone, I can NOT play my old game.  Basically, Valusoft just stole one game from me without providing me another.  Unbelieveable.  Avoid purchasing this copy."
5,Super cute,"Got these as a Christmas gift for my daughter, she loves them, so far no issuessuper cute, also love the fact that the microphone slides into headphones when not in use, rather than just folding up."
5,Cabela's Dangerous Hunts 2011,"This game is great for the whole family. From my 3 year old Grandson to his 64 year old Grandfather, we all really enjoy it! The gun is great but we are not using the scope."
5,"Great fit, feels better for my big hands.","Feels great, nice snug fit on the sticks, much better on my thumbs. If you have large hands I would definitely recommend. Will update if I have any problems."
5,Five Stars,Brilliant Keyboard with Amazing LED lights. Keys are comfortable as well. The keyboard is very beautiful and works fine. I actually doubt the previous reviews because the keys are pretty easy to see and are visible. The keyboard is fully functional as well.  I prefer this keyboard over a blue tooth one because the blue tooth onse some times are bugged and would disconnect frequently.
4,good buy,"this is a pretty solid kit for the money, my only gripe with it is the case is not dockable"
2,THIS IS NOT 2 GAMES,"Should have done my research first.  This is not 2 different games.  Super Luigi is the EXACT same as Super Mario, you just cannot play as Mario and you only get 100 seconds to finish each level.  Felt like a VERY misleading description and I would not have paid full price for this had I known this.  Definitely feel lied to.  2 stars because the game is still the usual fun you expect from a 2D Mario game."
5,YEAH A GREAT ORIGINAL PLATFORMER ON THE PSP!,"Well it is about time.  We finally have a good original title on the PSP.  THis one is in the form of a platformer.  For those confused, a platformer is like just about any mario game (super mario, mario 64 ect)  You basically have an action game that requires you to kill things (in a fun way) and jump from this platform to the next avoiding obstacles and enemies along the way.  These are some of the most creative games in the history of video games.  In my opinion they are also some of the most fun.  Fun creative action games, what more could you ask for.  Tokobot is great!  It is one of those rare platformers that actually uses some of the old standards and puts a new twist on them.  This time you get the bad guys and jump from platform to platform, but you do it with five robots you found on a archeological dig.  The robots have three major functions that help you on your journey.  I will not spoil the fun of discovery, but trust me, it is fun.  the controls are great, the game is light and fun.  Most of all it is creative.  Bottom line:  Get this game for it's fun creative innovation."
5,Fun wheel,My son loves this wheel. He loved that it vibrates and makes it feel like he is really racing. It's also sporty looking
5,Works Great,"We bought an inexpensive, second dock to use the Switch in another room, thinking that any USB brick would work.  After trying several, random chargers, I realized we needed a specific charger to keep the Switch from slowly dying during play.  It hasn't gotten heavy use, but this inexpensive item has worked great.  I highly recommend it."
5,Clarification of John Fowler's preview of Rebecca,"A 4K restoration is not the same thing as a 4K resolution presentation. 4K restoration only means that the film was scanned at 4K resolution for the digital restoration process. A 4K resolution presentation would require that the discs were released in the 4K  Ultra HD format. The Criterion Collection has never issued discs in that format, hopefully they will do so at some point in the future. So the bottom line is this, I've no doubt that the new Criterion Collection reissue of Rebecca will be the finest version ever released. It will not however be released in 4K at this time, the resolution will only be 1080p as is the case with all Blu Ray discs. A high quality up-scaling 4K player can bring you closer to the look of 4K, but not at actual true 4K resolution."
5,Better Late Than Never - I am on the Wii Sport Bandwagon,"I was trying to find a new one in the store and the clerk laughed saying how many years ago did we sale the Wii with Wii Sports and Wii Sports Resort.  Anyone I found one on Amazon with all the original packaging, parts etc.  I am having fun getting some exercise with my Wii Sports.  I love the bowling but I am trying the other games.  Plus I have family members giving me their old games for free.  Helps with the stress after works as well."
4,don't buy if you have played the PS3 version,"I LOVE the devil may cry series, one of my favorite franchises in gaming so I bought his collection despite having the PS3 one already. was it worth it? I would say no, if you have the PS3 one don't get this, it doesn't really look or play any better. If you have not played the PS3 collection then this is a good value."
5,"Feels great, cant find a case",This grip feels great. It's made of good material and is very protective. The only problem I'm having is finding a carrying case that it will fit in.
1,DO NOT BUY AT THE MOMENT,"To anyone out there, do not buy this game. As I'm sure you have read elsewhere, the game is experiencing ridiculous queue times to log in. On my server, wait times exceed 3 hours."
1,I was very disappointed because it did not work properly,"I bought this in hopes that it would replace the old xbox I had played on for a while, but once I received it, I was very disappointed because it did not work properly.  It was in good shape, but it would not read discs or open and close after the first time. I was thoroughly disappointed.  I will be returning this product immediately, and I am just saddened that a company would ship a product that doesn't work to a consumer."
1,Verified cheap product with shoddy materials,I don't usually take advise from other peoples feedback on Amazon (never know what their experience or expertise is) but this time I should have. The controllers are fine if you don't mind the joystick registering input with out it being touched. The only other review at the time concluded a similar issue and I am verifying it. Don't waste your time (not a waste of money as amazon is giving me a full refund) look up another controller brand and spend a couple bucks more for a better quality replacement as that's what I am doing.
1,Great for the fist 6 months.,The controller is great for the first 6 months then it all goes to hell. The grips and bumpers fall off making it pointless to use.
5,Best snowboarding game ever,"I loved Road Trip, but really didn't think this game was going to be THAT much better. It was BECAUSE I loved Road Trip so much that I didn't think this could do more than measure up, which would have been enough to make the game worth playing. This takes the concept to a whole new level though. Instead of riding around for fun and doing random tricks with the occasional competition, this one is all ABOUT competition on a global scale. Travel all over the world again, but this time compete and gain in ranking as you do so. The levels are amazing and the challenges are plenty. The Balance Board makes this so much fun, adding a sense of realism that you couldn't get with the mote alone. An awesome game in a now awesome series."
4,Had to make a headstrap.,Kids love it but we had to design and print a headstrap for them to fully enjoy it. Plus side i guess is it's something new for my Etsy shop....
5,Worth it,"Definitely worth the buy if you need to repair, (or in my case attempt to repair), your GameCube. Unfortunately I'm probably going to have to order a new laser disc reader. But the screwdriver is fantastic. Definitely worth it for the value and the sturdiness of it!"
5,My son went berserk,This is a beautiful device! Got it for my son's birthday and he loves it. The color makes it more special. Very pleased.
5,So Glad I Bought An Xbox One,"This game is awesome. I've described it to people as Jet Set Radio Future meets Left 4 Dead, which I think works pretty well. I beat the storyline a while back, but the replay value is excellent. I'm still completing all the side quests and getting all the collectibles. There are a lot of achievements to get through if you're into that sort of thing and most of all, this game is tons of fun. It's vulgar, gorey, it's got punk rock music and even a cameo from King Buzzo of the Melvins. You can turn off the swearing and set it to low-gore if you're buying this for a kid, but really, this game is meant to be enjoyed by adults."
2,"Fun game, but littered with Bugs","This game is fun and the story is great, but man this game is filled with bugs. Random bugs for example, all access to shooting, weapons, etc. stops right after a mission or after a cut scene. You're left with running away or using the R3 kick. I had to close the game multiple times and start again. I like the game but the bugs makes it terrible. I should have waited for it to go on sale a few months after its release date."
5,Good for a Laugh,Bought the game because I had never played it before but heard how glitchy it was and thought it'd be a good laugh.  I had a great time with some minor frustrations.  The game was in perfect condition witch is the most important thing considering it was used.
4,Great gameplay and great support by developers,"Although the launch was a little rocky the developers have been making lots of updates to SimCity.  The game has been running very smoothly for a while now.  The gameplay is very fun and engaging, even my wife who doesn't like computer games really likes to play SimCity."
1,Did not last long.,I've had this for under 3 months and only used it about 10 times.  This morning I plugged it in and shortly the charger smelled of burning plastic and became so hot I had to get a pot holder to be able to unplug it.  I really hope this did not damage my Switch.  I am very disappointed.
1,Terrible customer service,Astro customer service is the worst in the industry stay away
1,Why buy a game that isnt yours?,"Online DRM. Nuf said...When EA goes out of buisness, you will not be able to play ever again. Why play when you know one day the game will literally be unplayable?!"
1,If you enjoyed the betas then DO NOT buy this game,Ubisoft is the worst company I have ever come across
4,Love it!,"I bought this game from a software club on a whim.  My 7 and 8 year old boys were sort of interested in chess, and my husband's name is Fritz. So I thought if I was lucky, the software could help them learn some of the basics of chess.  It has FAR surpassed my expectations.  They love it, and have spent HOURS playing it.  They know how all the pieces move, have learned some of the finer points such as ""castling"", and still keep playing.  I hear them repeating the little rhymes that the program uses to help them remember different strategies....""a knight on the rim is ugly and dim""....""pawns are afraid of nothing; they move straight ahead"", etc.  In just a couple of weeks, they know WAY more than I know about chess.  I would love to have this program in my middle school classroom, as I think my students there would enjoy it, as well."
1,Disappointed,There are no catch wires on the deck. None. The game simulates the instant stop of the wires by inputing a super high drag effect on your plane that stops it nearly as fast. Fun to fly the big jets. Would not have bought the title if I knew there was no catch wires to grab me. :(
5,Great sequel and game,"I am not sure why Monster Hunter Stories didn't get better coverage when the original game came out.  Its a super fun game with tons and tons of content.  I have both the iphone and 3DS version.  I am still playing it today.  I was super excited about MHS2 and bought it on pre-order announcement.  I got my copy today, but I have been playing the free demo.  The story is great so far.  I like that it has connection with the first game.  The graphics are upgraded form 3DS of course and it looks more like the iphone version.  I have not seen any performance issues that reviews have mentioned.  There are some great quality of life enhancements, which I like better than the first one.  Although the touch screen on 3DS is always useful.  If you are an RPG fan or MH fan, buy this game.  For some MH fans, they may be turned off because its not a traditional MH game but its just fun!.  I think people that like Pokemon or Dragon Quest would enjoy this game, as well.  While this game looks like a game for younger audience (and it could very well be an introduction for younger audiences) it still has great content for adult gamers and the challenge does ramp up as you go along."
1,"Do not purchase, please wait a few months.","No party system, no easy way to play with friends, 64 player conquest is broken, constant loss of connection from servers, this game is a giant mess.  Wait a few months to purchase it, maybe things will be better, but I suggest you wait."
5,Great Game!,"I purchased this game at Game Stop on October 25, 2011.  My husband and I love to play this game.  It is so much fun!!  It's not too hard to play.  In my opinion, it is easier than the Mario games.  My first Kirby Game was Epic Yarn.  I enjoyed it, so I figured this one would be good too.  My husband thinks that this game is better than Epic Yarn.  I would strong recommend purchasing this game."
5,Works Great!,My son uses this with his Nintendo Switch.  He loves using this rather than using his switch controller.
5,Buy it now.,"Button mapping is incredibly quick and easy. Mods are simple enough. Very comfortable. Only downside is it has to be wired to the PS4, would be nice if it was wireless."
1,So disappointing!!!,Dont advertise with supergirl on the front if she don't come with the product.
1,OVERPRICED,Horrible Price Gouging
2,Kinect is good concept however....,"The Kinect is a good product, but it is hard for anybody who lives in a small house to play effectively. You need at least 7 feet of open space to play and at least 9 feet for two people which makes my cousins house a bad place to play.(He lives in an apartment) So we set it up at my house and works great but its difficult to position near my 47"" LG LCD tv. The voice commands are awesome but very few like ""open tray"" and you can't navigate out of menus? I have all three systems and find the kinect to be a ""top of the line"" tech gadget, but not as well executed as it should have been. It is cheaper than other ""motion capture"" devices i.e. PS move and Wii but not as fun in my opinion. I hope future updates can iron out the bugs in the kinect."
2,Sweet controller that didn't last,This is a sweet controller with good feel and handy programmable buttons on the underside. Unfortunately I started getting right analog stick drift after a month of use and its gotten so bad that its unusable. Maybe I received the one bad one out of the bunch.. Either way I'm probably going back to brand name after this snafu.
5,A great easy listening CD,"Since engineers perfected the TVs and visual images  became important for songs through video clips, we have suffered a continuous abuse by mediocre but above-average looking singers who rely on visual effects,  semi-naked bodies and performances with sexual tones to promote their silly disharmonious songs.  If you are also unhappy with the above and you love easy listening music, then you will appreciate this CD. Demis Roussos' voice is mellifluous and charismatic. Not many singers have the gift of such an outstanding voice. The musical scores have a happy tone and match perfectly Roussos' voice creating a very enjoyable and pleasing effect. This CD will be a great addition to your collection."
1,Dollar Store quality.,"Super cheap and i'm afraid its going to bend my cards. I am so discussed by the quality its hard to understand how horrible it feels to hold. The plastic cover wont stay shut and distorts as soon as you bend it to put cards in. The inside is basic thin plastic pockets with cloth separators. Holds four cards in front and four reversed with fourteen sleeves for a total of one hundred and twelve cards it can hold. No personality and cheaply made, my respect in Hori as a maker of products is deeply shaken."
5,Excellent versatile device,This is not a phone. At least in the traditional sense. It's a folding little computer that happens to make phone calls if you need it to. After many updates the software experience is good to very good. Still not perfect but no operating system is. It's dual screen capabilities are just unrivaled with anything else out there right now as well as it's versatility. The camera is MUCH better than it was when it debuted then again that was never a selling point. This is a great productivity device and a surprisingly capable media device as well that just works as my everyday driver. Don't think I'm ever going back to a candy bar slab again...
1,DO NOT CONDUCT BUSINESS WITH THIS SELLER. FAKE MERCHANDISE,"False advertising. This isn't even a legitimate Nintendo Game Boy cartridge, as shown. Trademark name at the top of the cartridge simply says ""GAME"" compared to a real one which says ""Nintendo Game Boy"" and the circuit board is an obvious fake. Unbelievable that someone would actually try to pass this off as genuine."
5,Rapidez,"Producto impecable, tal cual como dicta su descripción, mi hijo quedó encantado. Además el envío fue en menos de una semana, por lo que no tuvo que esperar demasiado por tenerlo."
5,This is the bracket your looking for,"This is a cool product. It really helps clean up your entertainment setup and is actually very sturdy. I was worried at first so before I put my precious ps4 on the bracket I found a hevier book I did not mind altering a bit and stick it on the bracket. I slammed the other side of the wall, pulled on the book, wiggled, slammed, every little thing I could think of and it is solid as a rock. With that said I was able to find a stud to stick the bracket into. If I was sticking it into dry wall I would grab a nicer set of drywall screws from your local hardware store. Also this bracket worked just fine with my ps4 skin."
5,Loved This Download...Would definitely do it again!,"I usually only buy the actual game, but was interested in how the downloaded game would play on my laptop. I was a little skeptical at first because of the mixed reviews, but I figured it was on sale for a great price and it would be worth the risk. I am not the most computer literate girl, so I was worried about whether I would be able to install the program by myself. The install was great!!! It did not take long, it was simple and easy even for me! I was also able to register the game on the website and receive the free gifts that come along with the version if I had purchased it at the store. Game plays wonderfully!!!! Love it, best Sims to date!!1"
1,DRM? Not buying,I had been waiting for this game for well over a year. Not going to buy it until they fix the DRM and spyware.
5,Center of attention,This keyboard is AMAZING!! I use it in my office at work and all my girl coworkers are jealous lol great quality. Beautiful lights! Definitely recommend!!!!
5,"Doesn't Get Any Better, In My Opinion","I recently purchased an HP all in one and the keyboard was something that was ridiculously small and had an equally ridiculous feel to the touch. The keys were small, with no tactile feeling so I went looking for a better and larger keyboard and stumbled upon this. After reading several of the reviews I stopped looking and ordered this Havic board. Wow, what a wonderful choice. It was hooked up and working within thirty seconds and it is as beautiful to look at as it is to type with. It does have that mechanical feel that lets you know you are typing, and several other features as well, most of which I will never use. The ability to control sound volume from the keyboard is one feature I will use along with one touch mail retrieval. I am not a gamer so I cannot really speak to the mouse, but it is beautiful and well designed and I love it as much as I do the keyboard. I saw other boards that cost less and some that cost more, but I don't think you can go wrong with this one."
5,Buy It Now!,"Jeffrey Russell does it again! I received The Dungeoneers for free through Kindle Unlimited and have read it more than a dozen times. I refuse to return it; it is an oasis of fantasy in a dystopian desert. Blackfog Island is the second in hopefully a long series of silly, fun, and refreshingly unpredictable irreverence."
5,pokeman happy,"I purchased this game as a request from my son ""Storm"". He had the game before and really enjoyed it. He is VERY happy to get another and that it arrived so quickly"
1,Once again dissapointed by Battlefront,"Just like the first Battlefront that came out recently (The biggest waste of money ever) I wanted to like this game a lot.. However, EA once again ruins Star Wars again. The campaign, one of the big highlights of the game from the makers, is incredibly short and almost pointless. Almost as bad as not including one. The multiplayer mode is alright, but EA ruined this again with all of the micro transaction that has been plaguing and ruining games the last few years. Also in the damage taken, hit count, etc. is very odd in multiplayer and not consistent at all. How hard is it to get a decent single player story in a universe as diverse and complex as Star Wars? This shouldn't be called Battlefront ll, but what they owed us for the jumble of nothingness that was the first one. EA once again dropped the ball on what should be a very simple game to make."
5,Five Stars,These work just as good as the one that came with the ps4.
5,Great Headset!,"Got these for my dad to use for online work conferences, and he loved them so much that I got myself a pair to use for my online university tutorials. My only minor complaint is that the USB cord to activate the lights is pretty short."
5,"Works like a dream, and for the price, you can't beat it!","I needed a new charger for my Nintendo DsiXl, and thought i'd snag one of these, since the price was DEFINITELY right.  I got about a week after I ordered it, and it works like a dream!  I've not had ANY problems with it.  If you need a good charger, i'd strongly recommend this one."
5,Don't by this if you want to spend time with you SO.,My husband asked for this for Christmas and I haven't seen much if him since then. When I do see him he starts taking weird. I think he started worshipping some diety called the Allfather and yells that he is going to bathe in the blood of his enemies. I think he has joined some sort of online cult. I think I made a bad choice when I purchased. I would not recommend buying if you care for your marriage.
4,Extremely Sensitive Microphone,"Overall I would rate this product as a 4 out of 5. While these gaming headphones do have a sleek visual appeal, a comfortable cushion around the ear, and an easy to adjust microphone, there are some issues. The only reason I have this product a 4-Star rating is because the microphone is very sensitive and picks up all sounds nearby, including footsteps if mobile and on a call. When not mobile, if you are not in a very silent room, communication becomes difficult because of this issue, especially if you have children. These headphones are soft and easily adjustable and the microphone adjuster on the chord is very handy, save being a bit bulky, but the 6 foot padded chord seems to be sturdy and well made. Overall a good product."
2,Sims 4 is a reimagined Sims 1,I thought this game would be all of sims 3 and then some. Unfortunately I was mistaken. I find the controls hard to navigate and building is not as easy as it may seem. This game is more reminiscent of Sims 1 than its predecessor Sims 3. The game has no toddlers or babies like the sims 3. It has a crib with a baby inside and when it gets picked up it looks like an alien. I also do not like that the sims are locked into mini neighborhoods within the town and there is a go between screen when travelling to a community lot. Honestly Sims 3 was much better game play wise. The only shining star i have for this game is the ability to manipulate the sims in create a sim.
1,Not going to buy the game,"I'm glad I read the reviews because I was going to buy the game, but after reading you need an online connection at all times I decided not to buy. What a shame."
1,Bait and switch.,"I preordered this after reading all 4 games would be on the cartridge which is what we were told by the developer when it was announced. Come to find out when I opened the box after receiving it, the cartridge only contained Trine 4 and 1-3 were a download code."
5,Amazing,"One of the best tomb raider games in a long time!  The graphics are amazing and the game itself has a great story (so far!)  Dont believe what these 1 star reviewers are saying, esp since one of them only has given 1 star to everything he reviewed (obvious troll) and the other thinks that tomb raider started with the movies LOL  Trust me, get this game and you will not be disappointed!"
2,Iron Not Strong Enough,"The Iron Man game is yet another movie based video game gone bad, the graphics look like PS2, the voice acting is fair, but nothing you'd remember, the game might make you sick the flying is unnatural as it would be to any normal person, the fighting even on hard is repetivtive and poorly done. the upgrade system is the best part of this game getting new and improved weapons just wish i wanted to use them, don't waste your money, rent it and then return it and keep playing GTA IV"
5,Excellent unit!,"Great addition to help our your overheating ps3, mine's been nice and cool since purchasing this and looks like it belongs on the unit!!! highly recommended!!!"
4,Highly recommended for 80s kids!,"I got this for my husband for Christmas...he loves it and says it's just like the original.  He said it's very ""nostalgic.""  The graphics, as expected, are terrible, but that doesn't seem to matter when you're seeing something straight from your childhood once again."
1,I had to give it 1star,1star is too many for this game. It's redundant and the graphics are last generation. Does not live up to the capability of the xbox one. For the first hour it's ok but after that it's repetitive and predictable. This is a rental only at best. But beware there is no campaign so renting would require a online code. I can't believe they have a campaign mode that is almost identical to multiplayer. Ridiculous and poor planning. They had the opportunity to make this a game changer but failed miserably.
1,Unhappy Camper,When I purchased this download there was no indication that sign-in to the Origins site would be required to start the game. I thought I was purchasing the full version with full user rights. The Origins software also prevents Windows from closing without having to go through the added step of closing it. A bad product.
1,worse than Word 2007,"I just test-drove Word 2010 and have to say that the development team at Microsoft has apparently learned very little from the mistakes of Word 2007.  The horrendous user interface is still there!  Forgive me if I sound harsh, but the project management staff which allowed this affront to productivity to come to fruition ought to be sent on to other career options.  Don't waste your money on this product if you can find an alternative.  Maybe Amazon still sells old copies of Word 2003.  One can hope."
2,Can't read the small text,"I thought this would be a good and fun game to play with guests when entertaining or to play with signifiant other. I find that the text on the screen is really, really, small.  I was really hoping that the game would speak the questions out loud but that is not the case.  I have a 42-inch plasma tv, and despite the fact that it is a relatively large TV the text for the questions is really small.  There are some fun twists to the game that I like, but the fact that some people are faster readers than others and the fact that the font is so small gives others an unfair advantage when playing multiplayer.  All in all the game is just OK."
5,"They work, but maybe not what you want...","The PSP AV cables work, yes. But, they might not be what you want. What these AV cables can do are play PSP Movies, music, and display pictures on your TV. What I wanted and possibly you, is to play games on a TV. These AV cables do NOT do that. What you need are component cables for the PSP. If you want to play PSP games on a TV, get those instead."
1,Assembly sucks!,How do you assemble this???? The instructions are wrong or it just does not work.
5,grandson loves this playstation,"I had bought the X-box for my grandson, and he wasn't excited about it so I had bought the PlayStation when it first came out and really wanted to get him the PlayStation 5, but it was sold out every where. He is very happy with this PlayStation 4."
5,Works great for playing docked,"I bought a Switch from a friend and it was missing a bunch of accessories. I was told any old HDMI and USB-C would work for the dock. Ya, you can charge it with any cable, and indeed use a generic HDMI, but the dock needs more power and trying to use a different cord I kept getting a message saying to use the original power adapter to play docked... this may not be the original, but it supplies enough power and works perfectly to play on a big screen."
5,Good grip,I have the previous grip modle. Its bigger than this one so if you have big hands check that on out (its called cyber Gadget Rubber coating grip 2). I have small hands and wanted something more portable so I bought this one. It has a nice feel to it. It came with one missing screw at the back but thats not a big problem to me. It feels weird compared to the previous grip but I got use to it.
1,Unbought program comes with the game.,"Warning, this games comes with Steam. If you delete Steam, Steam gets even by deleting all your games and your money is flushed down the toilet. Be sure you allow Steam to control your computer from now on if you want to buy this game."
5,"Retro gaming rules, and here's proof","A retro-loving gamer's dream come true, Capcom Classic Collection features 22 favorites from the legendary game company, and what a Capcom compilation be without a few Street Fighter games?  This collection's biggest flaw is that the SF games here (Street Fighter 2, SF 2: Champion Edition, and SF 2: Hyper Fighting) have suffered the most because of the annoying loading times between fights.  Not to mention that the Playstation's controler never really suited the SF control scheme, but when you get past all that, you'll find one of the best classic game compilations on the market today.  There's some excellent games here, including 1942, Mercs, Forgotten Worlds, Final Fight, the Ghosts 'N Goblins series, Bionic Commando, and more; and for the most part, they all play as great as you'll remember.  There's a ton of unlockable content and extras as well to keep you busy, but while as great as this compilation is, there are a few glaring omissions.  First of all, where are the Strider games?  The Strider series is one of the most renowned Capcom series alongside Street Fighter and Mega Man, and the fact that there are no Strider games here will leave you scratching your head.  Also, how about the very first Street Fighter game?  Or how about Puzzle Fighter or Darkstalkers?  I would have rather seen any of them than the lackluster Pirate Ship Higemaru.  Oh well, it says ""Vol. 1"" on the side of the case, so hopefully Capcom will roll out future volumes with the aforementioned games (and if you know Capcom, you know they have no quams about sequels).  In any case, Capcom Classics Collection is still a must own for retro gaming lovers, and at the bargain price this package is all the sweeter."
4,Anime RPG Game with a Twist,"Forget the standard Final Fantasystory line. In Thousand Arms you play as Mice Triumph a letcherous young man on a quest to regain his kingdom, and woo any young woman in his path. The game features the best voice overs in any game the Playstation has ever made and the graphics are a culmination of Lunar 2 and Final Fantasy VII. For anyone who wants to have a wonderful story in the tradition of anime, and laugh for hours at some of the funniest dialoge yet, then look no farther then Thousand Arms. Warning the game while not anymore violent then any of the Lunar games does contain quite a few sexual innuendos, partly spawning form the unique system of this game where you can go on dates with each girl and try to win her over. This game is suggested for an audience 13 and up."
1,DON'T BUY,"DON'T BUY! My friend got this product with the Nintendo Switch. He put it on, and it looks fine (personally I don't like the design). They claim that it is especially made for the nintendo switch and will not ruin the plastic like dBrand says. However, it does ruin the plastic. My friend attempted to take it of and it left marks on the Nintendo Switch which looks even worse than the skin (that is to say very bad). DON'T BUY!"
5,It arrived quickly,It was packaged well and my daughter loves playing the game.
5,This is an excellent toolset for working on a Nintendo Switch,"I bought this set after using a screwdriver that came with a replacement shell for my joy-cons proved insufficient. This set has everything you would need to work on customizing a Switch or replacing joy-sticks with input problems. I wish I could speak to these tools for working on other Nintendo products, but I would imagine that they are equally as effective. This set is great value for your money. I would highly recommend this."
5,Easy 5 out of 5,The game was 4 stars on the Wii because of of the motion controls but now it's easily a five out of five
5,Build -a -Bear DS,My granddaughter is loving this game.  I am very pleased as is she.  At 5 she is well advanced in her gaming and she is playing build a bear non stop!! Thanks for a great child friendly game.
5,Best game ever !,Awesome story. Perfect graphics. Best open world gameplay.
1,Total Letdown,"After a few hours dealing with many installation problems, crashs, bugs, system updates and useless registrations, i was able to run it and find out that the game doesn't look at all like it was shown in the advertisement screen captures, it has the worst graphics i've seen in the last 5 years, it's almost unbelievable but there's no anti-aliasing support, the game looks all pixelized and the shadows are flashing even on high end systems. also, you are forced to use ""microsoft games for windows live"" to be able to save the game. the driving experience is absolutely awful, the car's suspension is so bad that makes it feel more like a boat and there's still no 1st person interior point view. after so many years, the first mafia game is still looks better than this. Grand Theft Auto IV is way too expensive for so little it has to offer you, while there's no Mafia II available try Test Drive Unlimited if you want to play a decent open world."
1,Another useless Microsoft crap,Tried it and going to return it. Do your self a favor.....do not buy it! The system is slow to respond and the games selection sucks!
4,Its fun and great to use,"To first explain. It is hard to use at first, but once you get the hang of it . Its great. It has a few bugs but not major permanent ones. The blue led's get darker as the battery dies , but that is understandable. Very simple to use and set up. I would recomend this if you play alot of call of duty games. It does come with support on black ops 2."
1,"Great audio quality, iffy product","The audio quality is great, if it works.  I've bought two astro products, and have returned both of them.  Be wary, their customer support is very poor.  If you get one that works with no issues, I'm sure you will be very happy with it."
1,useless piece of crap,"I preordered this useless piece of crap in April because there was advisement that made it look something really useful, well I received it last week and to my surprise it doesn't with with Windows xp, vista. It only works with Windows 7, etc, when you finally get to install it, and you install the store site to get the apps, you find out that there's only no more than 20 apps . The apps are not cheap and they are the same as the device, worthless!,  I wish I could use it at least as a paperweight, but not even for that is good."
1,Bought them Jan 2017 and now Aug 2018 they aren't ...,Bought them Jan 2017 and now Aug 2018 they aren't turning on. Noticed they have been dying faster and I been charging them more and more the past month. Expected them to last more than a year. They look new still and were treated with care.
2,Whacky game,"The game is over top whacky,  you can't throw people anymore, which was the best ,driving  cars is difficult because you also have to control the camera at the same time while you  drive it not automatic camara control, you get tunnel vision while driving and crash. Storyline is boring and the new characters are also boring. Saints row II was the best, this is a low quality version. The codes they give u with the new release did not work, they showed up and disappeared ,so you couldn't download the items . Low quality game. Cars look terrible in the game, the city in the desert is boring and graphics look like there from 2007."
4,Excellent arcade shoot em up,"Take control of some of the best combat aircraft in WWII in this excellent arcade-style shoot em up.  This is not a flight simulator, as the aircraft are relatively easy to fly and control.  The trick is to keep your wits about you, fly like crazy, keep manoeuvring at all times, keep your eyes peeled, and keep shooting as enemy aircraft whizz past intent on shooting you down.  With a general scenario that leads you through the war, you can take the sides of the Brits, Germans or Russians, which puts a different spin on things as you master one side and then switch to another.  The odds tend to be stacked against you in the dogfights, but then that was what things were like for the Brits in the Battle of Britain!  All in all, great fun, using the Wii controller to good effect!"
1,What happened to Blizzard??,The single-person campaign was way too short for the cost compared to other RTS games (including StarCraft 1).  And I can't even resell this game???  And I have to put up with absurd DRM just to play the single-person campaign???  I have bought every game Blizzard has ever produced and I have always thought of them as a company that put gamers first.  Not anymore.  Apparently they have new masters now.
5,Great,My absolute love this!
1,False advertising!!,No disc drive!! Pictures show Xbox with disc drive and nowhere in the description of the product does it state it is an all digital console. This is crap because I can't use it with the discs I have.
1,Dont' buy it,The so called renewed product did not work!  Wasted 30 minutes of my time!
5,Safe Way to Charge These,I believe jamming a usb into the normal slot causes damage over time whereas the controller slides onto the front connector and this can charge two at a time.
1,More dead LED's again!,"More dead LED's again!  First keyboard had 5 dead LED's after 3 months, had to wait 4 months for Corsair to send a replacement which I got yesterday and now that one has 2 dead LED's.  Don't wast you time on these keyboards.  Corsair support is also very slow to respond."
1,One Star,Greedy idiots
4,Excellent buy!,"We got this game for my 5 year old daughter.  She hasn't put it down since Christmas.  She loves the game.  I think it is challenging enough for her with the jumping and so forth.  The only downfall, because it is geared for younger children, is that the story should be spoken out loud instead of the words being there and if they don't know how to read, they don't know what they are saying.  Other than that, my daughter loves it so it was a good buy!"
1,One Star,Cool product but there was a monster in box. Would not buy again. Would not recommend.
5,If you like big machines and what they can do? You will love this game,Most realistic farming game ever seen
1,Disgusting,"The game itself is a slightly below average crap: bugged, slow and poorly balanced. The plot though is something extraordinary. It looks like a fantasy of some Neo-Nazi. Calling that a history-based game is an insult to all who fought against Nazism in Europe and all their descendants. One star overall and a huge disappointment in Amazon for me for even selling this piece of garbage."
1,Fake.,"It was a fake copy that produces nothing but fuzzy graphics, glitches, and extreme lag. Real copy of Heart Gold on the right compared to the fake copy of Soul Silver received from Warehouse Deals, Inc."
2,Wait for price to drop,"Highly repetitive, certain quests have an absolute set path. Battle system is dull and has little variety. Story is confusing at best."
1,One Star,Purposeful price gouging is illegal. Hope you nitwits get slapped with a lawsuit for your immoral actions.
2,"Battery great, installation horrible","The battery is handy to have as a backup and works fine.  The mini screwdriver, however, is useless.  It doesn't work to open the battery compartment and is more likely to strip out the screw or scratch the back of your SP before it even begins to turn the screw.  I'm on the lookout for a replacement screwdriver but for now I use one of those 'eyeglass repair' kits.  The screwdriver in there works ok, but I'm sure there's a better one somewhere."
5,Looks awesome!,Definitely a perfect fit and I get so many compliments! 2 thumbs up
5,What a surprise,"I bought this game because I liked de blob for the Wii. This is absolutely the funnest DS game I have bought in ages, hands down. The graphics are beautiful, the platforming is very fun, the story is cute and it is just overall a fun title. It may be a bit too easy for the hardcore crowd, but I would still recommend it because it is so enjoyable. Alot of games that come out these days are so hard they can become frustrating, but not de blob 2. The difficulty is just right. This is a great game for anyone who enjoys platformers and works for both children and adults, can you believe it? I highly encourage anyone who has interest in this game to get it."
1,Memory leaks,Game play is good. Massive memory leaks. Cannot finish a game. The further you get the more it crashes. On a huge map I can make to turn 800 then it crashes every few turns after.
1,Not multiplayer and you have to buy tokens,"Multiplayer is a joke, 2nd person has to be from online community, half the games require tokens that you evidently have to purchase."
5,The next step in gaming is here!!,Still trying to get use to the motion sickness but i been weening myself little at at time. Resident Evil was hard to view at first but i been starting with smaller stuff(videos and lighter games) to get my eye's and brain use to it. Gets better every day and with that this thing is just amazing!!
1,Not Playable,"I have only had this product for a few hours, but I thought I'd write up a quick review to warn other people that may consider buying this game.  I'm hopeful that they will have patches and improve the quality, but as it stands right now this game is not playable on my system.  I have a modern system with 4gb of ram and GeForce 8800GT.  The problems are not from performance.  There seem to be a lot of little bugs and some huge.  Indoor areas don't render correctly.  Often the floor or some walls are missing and you could see right through them.  This makes it hard to navigate some maps.  I've also got caught a couple of times where after cut scenes it goes to the loading screen and doesn't ever seem to escape.  I've waited about 10 minutes before killing it.  This is unacceptable and makes the game unplayable.  I tried to check Rockstar's support site, but they don't even mention the PC version of Bully yet.  I find it unlikely that these problems are only with my system.  Hopefully soon as more reviews come in we will have an idea how common these issues are, and hopefully soon after there will be patches to make this playable.  I had a lot of hope for this game, but right now it is a huge disappointment.  I recommend that anyone interested in purchasing this game should wait and see if the issues are widespread before risking purchasing an unplayable game."
5,Mad Catz Memory Card,"Mine works just as good as my friends Sony brand memory card.  You have to sit down with a stop watch to tell if there is any difference in loading and saving times because it is that minimal of a difference.  It is a little more resistant when taking it out of the PS2, but not enough to make it a problem. Unless you just want to spend extra money for a name, I would recommend this memory card."
1,NA,NA
5,Mirra's awesome,"This game has turned out to be much more awesome than I expected. It was real easy to ride and do tricks. I like how the buttons are set up.  The challenges are just hard enough to keep you working on them, but not so hard that you would completely give up.  The levels are fun to play, especially when you can start doing superman's, flairs, and grinds.  This is truly fun and addictive game!"
5,"Both, a good choice","You get Soccer, Baseball, Basketball, Football (the US version), Bowling, Beach Volleyball, Table Tennis, Golf, Tennis, Boxing, Darts and Skiing. This is actually a pretty good deal as far as video games go. Gameplay is not challenging. Having all the sports in one purchase is very cool."
5,One of the best third party games,I have been waiting for this game ever since the director announced it would be more violent then manhunt 2. This game was just incredible in everyway once I bought it I couldnt stop playing it. The story is hilarious and the kills are phenomenal. I just beat the game and Im already playing it again. Suda 51 should be given an award and hes already working on another game for wii along with nintendo and Im already counting the days to buy that. I just hope to god theres a sequel on the way. BUY THE GAME NOW
1,Fragile,"This works with the game but it is the third one I am on.  I am not sure why they quit working, but they are extremely fragile.  Wit this one I am trying having this one connected to the USB port on my computer and leaving the rest curled up next to my computer and using a female coupler to link this to a standard instrument cable that goes to the guitar so it will take any abuse."
5,"Tons of storage, and its perfect for wii's that are shared.","Theres a metal button that swaps between 4 slots of separate memory which is cool, but I feel is a bit buggy, or I'm at the very least, not that experienced with it because I haven't explored it very much. For the gamecube it's more than enough storage, and I'm very happy with it. Slight issue (not a big one) sometimes it doesn't detect the memory card is put in, so you have to reinsert it, and even if your wii is off (I dont know if this is an issue with the actual Gamecube unit, maybe I'll test it if I feel compelled to.) the red light stays on as long as theres power flowing into the wii, even if its off. So trying to sleep with a red light sitting on your table is a little annoying, but a simple ""memory card pullout"" fixes it easily. Definitely would buy again, the cons are so minor it doesn't even bring it down a star"
1,Just got it and.....,"I'm running Win7 64bit. States is comparable but windows is unable to find drivers. I found a link to drivers with a name ""Microsoft_XboxOne_Wireless_Driver_Win7_Win8.1_AMD64"" , but that did not work either.... possible because of the AMD in the name and my pc being an intel?  I'll edit this if I get it working, or give up and send it back for full refund as not working."
4,IMPORTANT READ THIS BEFORE BUYING!!,"Ok so the product looks really good. The design and feel are good quality and I was excited to put it on my controller.  So here is where you need to pay attention.  Before buying, take apart your controller.  There is are two screws on the inside that need to be unscrewed to replace the cover.  The screw that's closeset to the sony button is the important one. If your looking at it and the screw is on the left side of the controller do not buy this item as it won't fit.  This item has the screw on the right side.  This is If your looking at it from the inside. Just a heads up since I ended up disappointed.  It looks nice though."
1,Disc Drive Not Working,I was so pumped to get it! I seemed to have no problems until I inserted a disc and heard the loud clicking noise and it telling me it could not read my disc. I don't want to wait for a new system. Boo!
5,Good controller,Perfect for cod and PUBG I love this
1,Bought madden goat edition a few days ago and just ...,Bought madden goat edition a few days ago and just received email it will arrive September 7 - 20. I have prime. Buyer beware!
5,Very fun game with good Online Play!!!,"I don't understand why some people think this is a bad game because to me this game is very fun! This game is a blast if you have people to play with, and even if you don't Wi-Fi is great. Wi-Fi has a points system something like what Wii Sports has and if you get to 1000 you get a medal for that sport. There is alos little to no lag during online play. The game also has a lot to do for just 1 player. It will take you a while to unlock everything this game has to offer. Anyone who puts Dodgeball down has not played this game because it might be the best game on the disc! All 4 sports are well done and easy to play. I think this is an excellent title that any Wii owner and Mario fan should at least try out. The only thing this game lacks in for me is music. I thing they could have had much better music in this game, but this game to me is excellent."
4,Does brotherhood and revelations need internet?,"So I'll get to the point, I love playing assassin's creed games(the first four game) and I love the idea of this game being portable but this needs internet connection to open, without internet you can only play assassin's creed 2 and to play the other two you need internet connection but I noticed that you can play the other two without internet after you open the game with internet connection and disconnect after then you can play but don't close the game or you will need to reconnect to the internet to open the game. So to make since this game is not portable if you want to play this on the go but if you are connected to the internet all the time than no problem. If your thinking maybe I didn't download the game then think again I played brotherhood about 4 to 5 hour already before I noticed that it needs internet. I don't know if other's people have noticed or don't care but its your decision to buy this. One last thing the prompt message that show on the screen makes it sound like you never downloaded the games."
5,Great underrated game,Game is pretty good for it being low budget. It really sticks to the first 2 movies. The game has the similar open world feel to something like the first borderlands game with a slightly smaller built maps. The story is pretty decent it isn't a gallery of boring shootouts. There's a lot to loot for in the game. Graphically the game has its own style. It isn't the best but it isn't the worst but it gives it its own unique look. Overall for a 20-30 dollar game you're getting more for what it's worth. It's a damn shame this game hardly had any spotlight.
5,Five Stars,"Nothing wrong with it, it works exactly how I expected it to."
1,This is so boring!!,"This game is not at all fun. I kept playing it waiting for it to get fun, but it didn't.  The game advertises that you get to ""do surgeries"".  It is literally coloring in the lines and playing matching and boring guessing games.  Save your money! It is seriously the biggest waste of time."
5,These buttons look great,I made a controller from the box it came in. The buttons look and feel great.
5,The Best since Aces of the Pacific,"First, yes this game is going to be the most demanding on your hardware, however, have no fear if you have an older system.  With a P-II 333 Mhz machine, i have to sacrifice a lot of the details, yet the graphics are still spectacular!  The damage effects are very impressive.  Dogfighting is thrilling and fun, with the realistic graphics and sound effects.  The first time you see a Zero catching on fire behind the sights of a Corsair is going to make a lasting impression on your mind.  I am already starting to like CFS 2 more than Jane's World War II Fighters.  The ocean and islands are breathtaking although you'd be spending much time flying out of sight of any land.. If there's one thing i find below expectation with the graphics, it had to be the gunsights and the general cockpit layout.  I think older games like Microprose's 1942 Pacific Air War did a much better job at that.  The gun sights look very unrealistic in CFS 2.  The documentation came with the game is decent, the 40s-style artwork is fresh, however, its historical review does not compare to Aces of the Pacific.  With only 7 flyable planes, CFS leaves out some of the most interesting fighters of the War.  It's another area that CFS failed to match with Aces of the Pacific.  Although CFS 2 provides favorites like the F4U-1A (my personal favorite radial engine fighter of all time), N1K1 George, it ignored all the Japanese Army aircraft, and players don't have the option to fly dive-bombers and participate in actions like the sinking of Japanese carriers during the battle of Midway.  Don't get me wrong, although it's not perfect, CFS 2 is definitely the best WW 2 simulation game available right now and it is certainly worth your money and upgrades.  definitely a five-star performer!"
1,Halo was a pretty defining moment for co-op campaigns,"Very unfortunate they took away split screen co-op. While not the first, Halo was a pretty defining moment for co-op campaigns, and now that feature has been removed. Microsoft has forgotten the joys of playing in the same room as your friends, or maybe that just doesn't make them as much money."
5,"Nice, get one, you will like it.","Easy install, plug and play so no software needed, I wish the print was larger in the instructions, but after reading it and finding what keys change the colors everything works as it should, I really like the way you can change the whole weight of the mouse, makes it feel well planted and the movements are very precise. Keyboard is almost silent when pressing the keys, no more click click click when typing, and that did take a little getting use too but not long. I found that the default settings work well for what I'm doing so I doubt I'll be changing any of those. So for the price it is a good buy and the quality seems to be very good. I would recommend this combo for anyone that wants something better than a standard keyboard and has some flare too it."
1,Just disappointed,"Ok so I'm not going to make a long boring review on the game, I hardly ever review products but Madden is one of my favorite games. I really love going online and playing and also playing against friends that come over. But often times when I'm by myself passing time I play franchise mode and do the fantasy draft, its super fun making a team with Fitz at receiver, rogers at qb, and say foster at RB... but madden took out franchise mode and replaced it with this horrible coaching mode crap. I'm not happy at all, I mean the game is fun online and with friends but over a third of this game is having fun with that fantasy draft. I can't believe they would just take it out, I wont return my game but I seriously wanted to once i found out I could no longer play the franchise mode the way I wanted too."
5,"Compact, sturdy, and versatile.","This product does exactly what it advertises and is far more sturdy than the small stand that's built into the Switch. I found the price to be well worth the quality and portability of this accessory. This stand easily fits into my Switch carrying case, doesn't add hardly any weight or bulk, and works flawlessly. To those who are displeased with this item, I'm guessing you didn't do a lot of research before purchasing. I'm completely satisfied with my purchase."
5,very good product,I brought this for my granddaughter she loves it
5,"Gigantic, quiet, and quick","The lauded and scarce PS5 console finally arrived for this humble reviewer after winning a chance to buy via Amazon (the third entry, the second win). The machine is enormous, as other have no doubt noted, dwarfing its predecessor to the point of near absurdity. Thankfully, apart from a familiar whir when starting up, it is whisper quiet. Once a game or film is loaded, there are virtually no load times. The interfaces are easy to use and downloads are quick from the Playstation Store. If you have a mounted TV, beware that the HDMI cable provided is woefully short and despite its towering height, you'll probably need to prop your console up on something in order to reach to intended input port. Be sure to affix to the stand first as the beast does tend to be top-heavy. If you're like me, you'll tire quickly of the loud, sometimes obnoxious sounds emanating from the controller during play. The haptic feedback is a nice touch, though. The graphical improvements over the PS4 are the true stars of the show, however. Do yourself a favor and download Demons' Souls, even, or especially, if the lack of graphical polish in prior From Software games has depressed you. Flip the game to Vivid mode and prepare to be wowed by the  the cleanness, the shimmer, the smoothness. Indeed, from top to bottom (and what a journey that is geographically across the console!), the PS5 is very, very smooth."
2,"Great expectations, but dissapointed!!!","First of all wanted to say that i've preordered the game and waited to play it. I was really excited and everything, but once I've started playing it, it did not feel at all as a game that I would enjoy. After playing Horizon: Zero Dawn and God of War,  I can tell that this game cannot come even close to these two games, despite the fact that one of the game is almost 2 years old (Horizon). The game looks sooo bleak and lifeless, controls are very sluggish and you have a feeling like you are walking in a swimming pool the whole time. At some point my fingers start hurting for pressing the buttons too hard. The controls are too complicated and there are like 50 different controls for all the actions you can make in the game. I almost always press the wrong button and most of the time kill someone and then i have to run. The story is not bad, but nothing interesting and it's really slow paced, and the dialog is constant so after few hours into the game you are like anoyed when two characters start chatting. I'm playing games from 1997 and I can tell that this is by far one of the biggest dissapointments. Even the graphics are not on the level it should be with all that hours spent in production and the 100GB of data. Probably I was expecting to much and I can say too much realism in the games it's not fun.  We have our lifes for realism, games should be little bit more fun."
1,Horrible Ripoff,"This bundle is severely overpriced, and they don't offer free returns if you realize you paid too much.  Disgusting."
5,Five Stars,Nice
5,Great find and fast shipping!,Awesome!
5,Good game!,"As usual, PopCap Games delivers another good game! In this particuliar game, you are seeking the whereabouts of the World Diamond. Some of the many locations you visit are England, Russia, Greece, India and Japan. In addition to finding your usual hidden objects, there are other objects you must find in order to open up the unlimited seek and find mode. The developers have also added another mode of play. Now, when you've unlocked the unlimited seek and find, there's a Spot the Differences game you can play also. No complex puzzle-solving skills are needed to play this game. It's well worth the money!"
1,Return policy?,The Black remote works great but the wires pulled out of the White remote the second time it was used. Is there a way to return the product if it's of stock?
1,AVOID THIS PURCHASE,"You get nothing with it, other than the docking station. ZERO. No power cord, no USB cord and no HDMI cord. Have fun buying all of those things separately. If you want to use this on a second TV in your house, you are either unplugging all the cords noted above to use it on another TV, or buying all the cords separately. I can only imagine how much of a hassle buying the power adapter separate from Nintendo must be, or risking buying some third party power cord that could fry and screw up the already gentle battery of the switch. This was a rip off that I would avoid."
5,Love for xbox,Great deal
5,So Much Fun!,"I had such a good time playing this game. It's almost better than the show because YOU, the audience member, are now part of the show. Not only is it fun to garden, decorate, cook, clean and shop during the game, but it's sooooo much fun watching the mystery that surrounds YOUR character unfold. I think my jaw literally dropped a few times throughout the progress of the game. I was addicted to it from the start, playing it for so many hours at a time that it only took me a few days to complete. I wish there was more than one story to play out, but that didn't stop me from starting it over right after finishing it the 1st time. It can continue to be new although the story isn't because you can choose to say different things and do different things. They have green goals and blue goals: the green goals are suggested, but aren't necessary to continue on to the next episode, unlike the blue goals. The second time around I decided to complete all my green goals before the blue ones because you don't get a chance to act out the green ones after you complete the last blue one for that episode, and I wanted to do as mush as I could. Even when it seems like you have time restrictions to get certain things done, take your time overall. The game even stops time for you at one point in order for you to complete your goals in time. And even when it doesn't, it'll pop up hints for you to get a move on certain things. Definitely look at your map of the houses; it often helps you along by putting a red ""X"" on someone's house, suggesting that's where you could be finding out something or maybe should be doing something there. Also, read all your goals in detail; they often reveal more leads for you along the way. Anyway, I can't wait for another one of these games to come out."
5,Must Have for All Action-Loving Gamers!,"I've played over 10 hrs on release day and I love it!  This game has everything I enjoyed about the previous game and so much more.  Gorgeous open world maps, endless action, awesome orcs and additional enemies, nemesis system, deep gameplay, many missions to complete.  This is a must buy for every action-loving gamer.  The loot box controversy isn't an issue.  If you want to earn loot in the game you complete missions."
5,Great headset. So far it works perfect.,"It was as described and works great. The headset was listed as refurbished and it came in a plane while box with only a minimal amount of bubble wrap protecting it, but the box was in perfect shape. And everything in it was pristine. Great headset overall."
1,More disappointing than expected.,"I don't know why catering to actual children with video games is seen as a waste.  Disney Infinity is the ONLY X-box game for little kids, as a Disney game.  By offering characters that are Disney they get these youngsters to want the game but are providing LESS AND LESS with each release.  There are princess characters, but the only place they can be used is in the Toy Box.  The Incredibles play set doesn't translate into the new game, making them Toy Box only characters as well.  The new play sets are all about super heroes which my princess has NO interest in whatsoever!  Why waste such great characters and princess mania by providing NO GAMES for these characters within DISNEY INFINITY.  It isn't called SUPER HERO INFINITY - it should have play sets for the princesses and classic characters, not a random focus on super heroes.  My daughter got this game yesterday, she is 6 and wanted this game so she could have Merida as a character and play games with her.  But she is already bored of the Toy Box, isn't interested in building worlds.  She wants to take the princesses on adventures like the stupid heroes get to do.  Please, think about your market and expand the play sets to include the characters that young DISNEY fans are interested in and stop catering exclusively to boys."
5,A great play-through many times over,"Fantastic! Graphics were great, playthrough was fun and interactive. it felt more like a story you were apart of as opposed to a game. The story developed non-linearly and very well done. I just beat it and can't wait to play through it again to get all of the other endings."
5,Forget the previous reader review who gave it one star...,"First of all, if you're gonna play the demo and review it based on the demo, you're a moron. It's called a DEMO for a reason--not complete and finished product. If you like RTS games and are a fan of the command and conquer series, this game transfers great from PC to console--surprisingly. Just read game reviews from other sites and you'll see what I mean. Graphics aside (good graphics), gameplay is simple, yet challenging. Good pick up--especially for multiplayer aspect via Xbox Live."
1,Worst product by Sony yet,"Sorry I'm a Sony Fan, but this one just can't be helped. Sound quality is nowhere near good. and the build quality is terrible. The pulse elite are much better sound quality, but my broke after less than a year with it."
5,500gb Super Slim,"Purchased this from Amazon Warehouse as ""used: like new"" item and I'm very pleased with it. I already have a Ps4 pro but I can't play college football or the Mass Effect Trilogy on it. Glad I was able to get one in such good condition at a reasonable price. Console, controller and cable were all in excellent condition. Still lots of great games available, many at discount prices, for this model."
5,Very nicely done,"I own the NES and SNES mini but did not purchase the PSOne. This SEGA Genesis mini is really a nice console. The games play nice, the controls are responsive, and the interface is user friendly. I especially like the fact that I can go to the main screen and choose a new game straight from the controller without having to touch the mini console. All around a good buy, especially for the nostalgia."
4,Good memory card but one should be enough...,"If you're completely one of those HARDCORE gamers who spend more than 4 hours a day playing videogames, 2 memory cards should fit you nicely, considering the amount of games you could possible play in that time.  However, if you're a easy gamer like me (no more than 2-3 hours a day) 1 should be enough.  If you're that hardcore gamer and need that much space to fit all your gaming needs, this is surely going to save you money, as buying 2 memory cards separately cost approximately 50 dollars, about the cost of a brand new just-released game.  These memory cards word pretty well so don't expect files that magically disappear or save files that become corrupted that lead you to start the game over again.  A memory card is a must buy if you own a PS2 but whether you need 2 is your choice."
5,Excellent XBox One remote,"This is the best remote I have used for the Xbox One.  The standard smaller remote that is produced by Xbox is good but it does not have as many functional buttons as this remote.  If you are watching a streaming service through your Xbox, this remote is the best option out there.  I don't use it with a DVR and I have heard some customers have trouble controlling their devices with it.  For my purposes it works perfectly and controls my TV as advertised."
1,Failed,Very obvious the new battery has an incorrect connector.
5,Can't go wrong with more cash for GTA.  Quick and easy.,"What is there to say, I got the code right away, loaded it into my Microsoft account and it worked.  No problems at all.  Highly recommended."
1,Buy elsewhere,"I've bought and returned this 3 times, they keep sending me the European version of the game. So none of the codes work. Do yourself a favor and buy it someplace else."
1,No download codes. Rip off.,I love all of the Ace  Combat games. But you will not get AC 6. You'll pay extra for it. But you won't ever get the code from this company.
5,Friggin' Awesome.,"Unreal 2004 combines UT 2003 and Halo together. I played the demo online and I must say the graphics are just beautiful. I have an ati radeon 8500 128mb, 1GB of corsair pc2700, and a p4 2ghz and I handeled the game at MAX settings at 1024x768 -- the engine is really something. For those of you who say that 2003 was better, thats impossible, because if you don't like the cars and ""complicated"" missions, there are good ol' deathmatch, team deathmatch, FFA and capture the flag matches without vehicles. Sound deserves 5 stars. If you have an audigy and a nice sound system (like logitech z560) this game is gonna rock your house. The ONLY thing I didn't like was the lagginess on big public servers (im talkin 32 ppl). Sometimes it gets outa hand and you cant even aim straight. But if its a LAN party - thats another story."
5,Great mouse for all players,Just posting some info: Very good mouse. DPI is changeable on the fly and the lights are somewhat clear. It comes in a small box. Setup was pain-free. Ergonomics are great. This mouse is silent when clicking. I've used it for several weeks on one charge. Recharge time is very quick. My gaming experience has increased significantly from this purchase.
5,Blocks out every one,"Got these for my husband because he plays video games.  Honestly, hear me out... worst purchase ever as a parent.  This is why,  we have three children and when he puts this on I'm the sole parent in the house.  He hears nothing! I mean 2 year old crying.. nothing. Me: babe...babe... nothing! 2yr old and 5yr old arguing... nothing.  I tried them on and it was loooouuuuddd! Imagine my shock when he took it and turned the volume up! It gets louder!!! He said he had to hear who is running up on him in C.O.D.. :-(  What about who is running up on us irl. Anyway,  he loves it and if ever I need to block out these active children of ours I know what to use.  It's great for everyone else :-) great headphones! Does it's job to well and did I mention how comfortable they are? Very well made."
1,DONT BUY THIS GAME BEFORE YOU HAVE READ THIS REVIEW FULLY,"NASCAR Heat Evolution is a good looking game, the cars look good, the drivers photos look good, and the tracks look good. You start off with a very limited number of mostly 1.5 mile tracks and you have to have a speed index of 2 at every track, or I think 7000 speed points. You earn a speed rating for every track after racing there. I don't think it has any meaning because after I raced at Atlanta I earnd a speed rating of 95, when I raced there again I thought the AI would be more difficult but they weren't. I had to manually set the AI difficulty. DMI, the developer clamed that the AI didn't have a programmed line around the track, but I found out that this was a flat out lie because if you were going 10 mph slower than other cars, they would stick to their line and hit you. You have 1 hour to practice, which is good, but in real NASCAR you would have multiple practice sessions. Qualifying is realistic, but you can't fast forward time in the pits. For the race length you have preset percentages. It would be better if you could just chose the amount of laps you wanted to run. You have to have a race length percentage of 7 percent or more to have flags turned on. The options for flags are, no flags, black flag, and caution flag with black flag on at the same time. The caution doesn't work if you spin out or wreck another car, so you have to wait for the pack to come around and hit you. Sometimes even that doesn't bring the caution out. If you pit under the green flag, the pit stop animation looks great, the pit box belongs to the team as well as the uniforms. Under caution you don't even go to the pits you just start back racing after choosing repairs. During a pit stop you can fill up, put tires on, make repairs, add tape, adjust wedge, change tire pressure. There are no changes for track bar or spring rubbers. The pre race setup is very good, you can change a lot of stuff but you would need to work on real stock cars to know what to do. There is no tutorial. You can't read the gauges in the car. When you find them by pressing the b button it only tells you oil temperature, damage, and tire wear. When in the car there is no speedometer or tacometer that you can read on the screen. The menus suck, there is no way to change assists like, traction control, anti lock brakes, stability control, auto braking, and there is no option for a racing line that tells you when to brake . They might as well not have a spotter because he rarely says anything even when you are in a pack of cars. If he does say something, its usually to late. You have 3 views to chose from when driving, the car interior, roof,  and chase, but you can't look around the cars in any view. The most important part is the physics, you have normal or simulation physics. In normal physics the cars is very jerky. In simulation physics your car drives better but if you hit the wall, apron, or the grass forget it because your race is over. You will spin out and no caution will be thrown.  Damage sucks, it looks pitiful. You can chose from, no damage, light damage, and full damage. In full damage most of the times if you hit the wall kind off hard, but not stupid hard, your engine will blow and there goes your race. They have add-ons for the game, challenges, different spotter, and paint schemes because the game only comes with the Daytona 500 paints. You will have to pay anywhere from .99 cents to 9.99 dollars for them. I RECOMMEND THAT YOU DONT BUY THIS GAME EVER, OR AT LEAST NOT UNTIL DMI GAMES FIXES ALL OF THESE PROBLEMS. IF I WERE NASCAR, I WOULDNT WANT TO HAVE MY NAME ON THIS PRODUCT. IF I WERE CARL EDWARDS, I WOULDNT WANT TO BE ON THE COVER OF THIS GAME. THIS REVIEW IS BASED ALL ON SINGLE PLAYER STUFF, AND NO ONLINE. This game was bought for my son as a birthday gift. He is very experienced with racing games, and is a teenager. He wrote this review."
5,Must Own,"Absolutely amazing game, must own"
1,Skip this mall!,"This is truly a low point for the series.  They stripped out much of the original games most defining characteristics, it has become simply a search and fetch game.  Gone are the interesting psychopaths, escorting survivors, and any sense of challenge.  This is the first Dead Rising game where once I had completed it, I have no desire to play through again."
5,Suprising and fun so far,"I was surprised as to how much fun this game is, You have a lot of RPG elements and a good story, I have only played this for about 3 hours so far (Game store near me had a midnight release). So far it is fun and exciting, JRPG fans rejoice it is what you want.  So far it has a lot to keep you playing.  RPG and JRPG fan will like to add this little gem to their collections."
1,Horrible in every regard,Horrible in every regard. Instantly regret the purchase. Online mode is terrible. Be prepared to wait 20 to 45 minutes for a race and not only that the options are so limited sometimes you have three options and two of them are Hyundai races around a circle. Honestly feel like they think their customers are complete idiots. Worst Gran Turismo ever by far. DO NOT BUY.
5,I was deciding between razer or corsair and then I came across cooler master.,"There's a reason mechanical keyboard enthusiasts recommend companies like cooler master and ducky.  The ones everyone else hears about though are razer and corsair. Razer and Corsair are great for having a large selection with varying prices but decline on quality. The wrist rest is perfect and the LEDs are bright, the material to make it feels durable and heavy. Only problem is that in order to tell you if caps lock or numlock are on, the keys LEDs turn on and off, I didn't mess around with the software very much so I might be able to turn that off. If you've been looking for a new mechanical keyboard and are horrified by corsair's and razer's customer support reviews and product quality, buy this."
5,Get this game if you are a terminator fan.,When I first heard about this game I had my doubts. The terminator franchise has been very rocky when it comes to creating believable and enjoyable video games. This particular game was a diamond in the rough. The graphics for this game are not stellar but no too bad either. The game play is rather solid. The role-playing aspects of this game were a bit of a surprise. This game is not based off a movie so the missions you will be involved in are completely original. If you read critic reviews for this game don't listen to them. If your an individual who likes the first two terminator films and also likes decent first person shooters then you should try this game.
5,Great for non-gamer family members,"Members of my household were never comfortable using or turning on my xbox controller to then control Netflix etc. This remote, with its shake awake feature and intuitive,  normal remote layout,  has solved the problem! I didnt even have to pair this remote with the Xbox Series X - it worked out of the box. I wish I got one a long time ago."
1,A waste of your money,"There is nothing and i mean nothing about spending your hard earned cash for this game. Things like the lack of great graphics, a bad plot make this game seem like it was rushed to market. All the powers that be should be FIRED. I cannot get my money back, i warn you do not spend one thin DIME on this crap. P.S ZERO STARS."
5,Perfect!,"The absolute best upgrade for the 4GB Xbox 360 slim! For a whole lot less than Microsoft's 250Gb hard drive and does exactly the same thing! It even says Microsoft when you are looking at your memory. Yeah you can't play the old xbox games, but you can go on ebay and get an old xbox for 20 bucks ."
2,Online Broken :(,"As of today, Halo MCC is the biggest disappointment of 2014.  This is the game that I bought an X1 for and the multiplayer is broken.  I bought this game the day it came out and I have only been able to play online 4 times.  343 has promised some kind of compensation for all who bought the game however who knows if it will be good enough to keep people from trading in there broken copies."
1,This the PAL version and not the NTSC version thats shown.,This product is displayed as the NTSC version of Minecraft but the PAL version is what I received. PAL versions are made for overseas systems and may not work on your Xbox360. I didnt read far enough into the comments to see others warning of this before I ordered this game.
5,So helpful,"I am not really a gamer but when playing long games of Scrabble, I wear down the battery on the controller.  Since I have and extra controller that uses batteries, I thought this would be a great idea to keep the fun going."
1,You can't touch the buttons,These are way too short and throw off your swing. The buttons are buried in the handle
2,"Too hard for a Pre-School child to use, but a nice idea.","I have really enjoyed the Reader Rabbit products that I have purchased in the past.  When I discovered that there were products for the Wii, I bought this game and the Second Grade game for my older son.  The 2nd Grade game is great, however I do not recommend this game for a couple of simple reasons.  The main reason is that my son does not have the fine-motor skills required to do the activities.  The game is set-up so that the child has to point the Wii remote at incredibly small objects on the screen (such as tiny, incredibly tiny, circles and triangles).  It is just too much to expect a small child to accurately aim the remote at the miniscule object and hit the ""A"" button on the remote simultaneously.  Related to this is my second complaint: the numbers and words shown in the game are also too small.  My son recognizes his numbers already, but when he saw the number ""4"" on a rocket ship, he thought it was a ""1"" because of it's small font size(Keep in mind that children this age do not have fully developed eye sight).  Thirdly, the activities take a long time to complete, which does not match my child's attention-span.  This game is a good first attempt, but improvements need to be made to the game, to reflect the abilities and attention-span of this age group."
5,Five Stars,A lit pad with a snake on it!!!! Sign me up!
1,Defective,I don't know if I received a defective one or what.  At first the controller would randomly disconnect from the Xbox and it started happening more and more frequently.  Even in the middle of playing a game.  Now it's to the point it does it so frequently it can't be used. Once it disconnects you have to force shut the controller off and sometimes restart it multiple times for it to work.  The controller that came with my Xbox works fine so I know it's not my console.  Id like to exchange it if possible.
5,A Must Have for the 360,"As the description says, a fiber optic cable is the only way to get the surround sound out of your 360. This is true not only for the games, but also for DVD playback. With this cable, my 360 has not only replaced my original XBox, but my DVD player as well. If you have a receiver that has a DTS decoder in it, you can play your DTS movies through the 360. I tested ""The 5th Element"" on the DTS track, and it sounded crystal clear, as did ""Call of Duty 2."" The cable is THX certified which ensures the best quality sound you can get on the market. If you want to use the speakers on your TV, fine. If you want the full 360 experience, get this cable and hook it up to your surround sound. You will not be sorry."
5,Good Enough To Make My Wife Play,"Asked my wife play the opening of the game to see the atmosphere and a particular fight.  She doesn't usually like games like this, but now she's hooked and I have to share it.  That's a sign of an awesome game!"
5,Great!,I love it! Fits perfectly and easy to put on.  A great case to protect my 3DS from scratches. :)
5,Highly recommend,Got for my almost 8yr old to chat on nintendo switch.  He is so happy!  He says it does not hurt his head or ears.  Read all the good reviews and they were right. Just wish the wire was longer- i feel like he is sitting too close to the tv screen.
5,Great little all in one kit,"Love that everything I needed came in this one package and for a great price at that. The clear protective cover is easy to install. Its perfect and slides into the docking station easily. The screen protector comes with a cleaning wipe, tape and micro fiber cloth and is an easy install. Case is well made and seems like it will hold up. and the little covers for the joy sticks are easy to install. This whole kit is well worth the money to protect your Switch."
5,Great headphones!,My son loves his new headphones! The quality is great and it fits well. I would buy it again (:
5,Best Kids PC Game Ever!,"This game manages to combine beautiful graphics and really fun gameplay while keeping true to the Harry Potter stories.  I've watched my kids (ages 9 and 12) play for many hours, finish the game, then start all over again because there's so much to find and explore.  We don't even have a very new computer and it still works and looks great!  You cannot go wrong with this game!"
5,Nike Trainer,I have already lost five pounds and I have been doing this since last Friday. It will have you sore but it is well worth it. I do the cardio portion of it once I get home from work. It is only 20-30 minutes but it makes you feel like you've done hours at the gym. Good luck and hopefully this helps.
1,No,Really gamefreak?
1,NOT COMPATIBLE WITH PS5 GAMES!!!!!,"Said 4TB, showed up as 3TB AND IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH PS5 GAMES!!!!! Soooooo mad right now"
5,Very Comfortable,Adjustable to fit comfortably over head and on ears.  Good quality sound reproduction and very nice mic.
5,Works incredibly well for gaming!,These are surprisingly good quality! Our entire family are gamers so we all use headsets. My 12 year old tends to damage his headsets so he goes through a lot of them. Because of this we don't buy high end headsets for him. These have held up and worked just as well as our more expensive ones! He uses them for xbox gaming.
5,BUY THIS DAMN GAME!,"By the GAWD on high! Please support the devs and buy this game! The art and design is superb, the combat is tight (a few glitches but so worth the tea)! The B E A T S!! THE SICK BEATS! LIKE DEAR GAWD THE SOUNDTRACK IS TOP TIER SHIZNIT! PLEASE BUY THIS GAME"
5,Quake 3 Linux Rocks!,"This is the best game that has ever been ported over to Linux since Myth 2.  It runs much faster on Linux and it's time that Linux users can have a little fun on thier computers too.  So move over Windows users, one mad  angry armed penguin named Quake 3 Linux is on the loose aimed for you! A  definite must have for any Linux user!  I give it 6 stars!"
5,Rock Band 2 vs Guitar Hero World Tour,"There are plenty of reviews out there for this game.  I just want to point out something to help with the decision many are asking.  ""Which one should I buy?""  Well, personally, I've gotten both and think everyone should but if you are limited to one choice, consider this.  The Rock Band 2 game currently overs you a much larger available setlist of songs via DLC (downloadable content).  I personally have over 500 songs for my Rock Band 2 game and while I have more fun sometimes playing some of the songs on World Tour because of the new features that were incorporated, I would choose my larger setlist game in the long run.  It seems the Rock Band 2 folks are working harder to get more songs for us than with Guitar Hero."
5,A lot more fun than I was expecing.,I am not a huge souls fan and I am not very good at those type of games but I am enjoying this game quite a lot. The open world elements the amount of hours I have already put into it in the past 3 days is just more fun than I expected. It certainly is still difficult for me but I like the fact that I have never once gotten stuck and unable to progress. I am able to walk away from battles that are too hard and then return when I get better. I am expecting to put at least 100 hours into this game by the time I finish. The story and the lore too is quite interesting and that is what I usually play these games for even when I am not all that good.
1,One Star,Cool product but there was a monster in box. Would not buy again. Would not recommend.
5,"Works with DVD Recorders, too!","I was about to retire an old standalone DVD recorder, because it would no longer let me create menus or finalize discs.  I bought this lens cleaner and -- voila! -- the recorder is working again.  Super easy to use (it's simply a DVD that you insert into your machine, and the menus tell you what to do).  Highly recommended."
2,What the hell?,Seriously....I was waiting quite awhile for this game to come out because its predecessor is freakin sweet.  It was all I use to play online.  After purchasing this game and playing it for all of 10 minutes I quietly put it back in the box and have not taken it out since.  Online play was non existent.  Everytime i clicked on a game it said it didnt exist.  It was ridiculus.  Letting someone else create this game instead of Infinity Ward was a giant mistake.  This latest edition adds nothing to the series.  Do not purchase this game....there are many better games out there.
5,Best multiplayer game I've ever played!,"This game is strictly multiplayer. When internet or servers are down, you can do NOTHING. That being said, it is such a well crafted and fun experience. Everything is unlocked from the get-go so there is no progression for moves. I love this because anyone and everyone are on the same playing field and it's up to skill, reflexes and critical thinking. There are unlockables in the form of cosmetics which are fun but not essential to gameplay. The best part about this game is just how fun it is. Every character makes you play the game differently and you must work together with your team to win. Best multiplayer game I've ever played."
5,Awesome gadget,First I loved that I received my product in a speedy manner and I just cherish this product because it is what I have been looking for! It is very sleek and small but packs a punch because it charges quickly. I will definitely recommend this product to my family and friends!
1,Price gouging,Terrible
1,Good while it lasted,"At first this battery was great - the life was a lot longer than the stock battery, however after a few weeks it stopped working - it wouldn't charge (the PSP acted like it didn't have a battery in it at all)."
2,Speakers on controllers are terrible,Speaker on one controller didn't work at all and the second controller speaker sounds terrible
2,Single player game,"Bought this for my son and husband to play Together. When I pre-ordered months ago there was Nothing in the description or photos specifying it was only one player. I specifically looked. No photo of the back of the package, I included for you now. There are four characters why on earth is this single player. So dissatisfied! They enjoy watching eachother play but not the team effort I was hoping for."
5,Very fun lol,"Hang out with my friends to play this game, have so much fun lol. Although there are not many songs in the card you may need to pay their annual fee to unlock more."
1,WOW...,Thanks EA for taking a great game franchise and a creative Software Group and running them into the ground.  Designing a game from the ground up with only future profits from downloadable content in mind is no way to keep a fan-base.
5,Excellent!!!!,"I really enjoy this game. I finding it hard to put it away at times because it's so addicting. I also like the fact that it's card based. It's too bad the people that are buying this game thinking it's a FPS never looked at a review or any other coverage on this game before buying it. To those: ""You have no one to blame but yourselves."""
5,Wii made a winner with this one.,I would like to start off by saying the Wii went back to the fun Madden when Arcade was king.Arcade version of Madden 12 is what Wii needed take the hi tech madden on my 360 and ps3 Hi def and set it to the side for the point and pass arcade call fun from Wii.I own both the ps3 and 360 and find the Wii more entertaining for hours of true fun passing and kicking challenge with friends.Way to go EA you did a great job.
4,Kind of a rip off but fun,My husband and 11 and 8 year old sons have had fun with the games but can't play the basketball game without Microsoft Award points which doesn't seem fair since we paid for the game.  We're kind of new to the Kinect system so maybe we're missing something but the games have been fun.
1,Wrong model. Not slim model,Says it's for the slim model but shipped one for the super slim model. False advertising
1,If you loved the first two Paper Mario games like I did,"If you loved the first two Paper Mario games like I did, spare yourself the pain and don't buy this.  It is not an RPG.  You have no party members.  It's sticker star 2.  You have to select and color a card EVERY TIME YOU ATTACK.  Don't do it.  Yes, the graphics are awesome, and the jokes are good, but It's just awful."
5,"Good for Arduino projects, receiver has power and signal LED lights","I bought these controllers with the intention of only using one of them as a remote control for a six-legged Arduino robot I built.  I'd already had two used receivers let me down, but the first one of these worked perfectly. The best thing is that receiver has a power LED and a signal LED, so the hobbyist can be sure that it's powered on and has a wireless connection to the controller. Even the more expensive brands don't have that. Even better, I now have an extra controller and receiver left over from this purchase for my next Arduino project."
5,Good so far,"No physical difference to the OEM control stick, so install was simple. No stick drift, or other issues, so far after a month. Will update my review if necessary, but so far so good."
1,Just get the board somewhere else. Unless you wanna pay more for the same thing.,"I'm sure the product is fine. The one star come from customer service, I ordered this item twice and both times it just came with the board. If I wanted to pay more for it I would of gone to Brook. The sole reason I bought it from here is because it States in the description that it comes with wires and extra components. Thanks for the false advertisement."
1,Controls have never been worse.,Clunky controls and ridiculous microtransactions ruined the game.
4,Best bang for the buck controller,I bought this to play games with my wife and as an alternative to use with my Nvidia shield. So far so good. Only time will tell quality and endurance. Battery life is on par with the original controller.
5,Did not fry my daughter's Switch,"I have read some of these generic charges might be incompatible with the Nintendo Switch, with horror stories like some chargers would fry the console. After much research, I almost bought the Nintendo brand charger but decided to take a chance on this brand instead. This charger worked perfectly, and was a good price. Switch still working after 6 months of use."
4,It works!,"My old Motion Plus Adapter was driving me crazy as I had to recalibrate every 5 seconds or so during the game I was playing.  I wasn't sure if it was the Motion plus adapter that was breaking down or the remote itself, but decided to get the adapters.  This came with 2 in the pack and once I put it on my remote, it started to work and I wasn't recalibrating so often.  My WII is one of the originals and when something doesn't work, I try to get just the part I need instead of buying a complete new set.  Since they don't make the original WII anymore, I was worried about not finding parts that broke down.  However, so far so good as I've purchased a new WII Fit balance board, a new tower thing that you insert the disc in, a new game, and now these adapters, so I'm happy!"
5,Bring your favorite characters to life!,"We had the first version of Disney INFINITY and couldn't wait for 2.0. This is just as easy to use as the original version with all new characters. The only draw back is only being able to use 1.0 characters in the toy box, and not in the worlds, but the kids still have fun with the older characters."
1,"Horrible, absolutely horrible","This is the worst video game I have ever played. The ""plot"" is pointless (and insulting), the graphics are ho-hum, and the ""missions"" are idiotic. I have been a big fan of the Ace Combat series and received this game as a gift. I was so disappointed that within two days I gave it back to the person who gave it to me to return to get something for themselves. DO NOT FOR ANY REASON BUY THIS GAME. IF YOU MUST PLAY IT, RENT IT."
4,Cool item to have,Love the way it looks! Pretty cool to have but not practical. I added a photo to show the thickness of the metal. Seems solid and made of steel because it's so heavy. Would not use it for my keys but a zipper on a duffel bag or luggage would do.
5,This is truly a company that CARES. Recommend this product,"I purchased the BluFire 3.5 mm Bass Stereo Headset on February 28, 2018. I for this headset and my daughter LOVES them for the comfort, style, great functions and the SOUND. The first set we received had some issues but BLUEFIRE company contacted me immeadiately and sent me a NEW pair with an apology for the issues with the first pair. I am so impressed that Bluefire was so concerend over our satisfaction that they reached out to make our experience better.  We are very satisfied with our purchase and glad to have done business with Bluefire for this great over-ear gaming heaphones."
1,Don't buy if you have a thin TV,"Not happy with this mount, I had to use zip ties cause it kept opening and sliding of the tv along with the tv and the front end is barely holding on the tv"
1,BEFORE YOU BUY DO THIS! IT'S FREE AND EASY!!,"I recieved this game for Christmas and was very disappointed when I found out it wouldn't work on my Windows XP Dell. I have the wrong video card. A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL HAVE THE WRONG CARD, FIND OUT IF YOU CAN PLAY THIS GAME ON YOUR COMPUTER BEFORE YOU BUY!!! I wish I knew this before: go to the Eidos Interactive website, click on ""games"" choose Lego Star Wars from the list. On that page, there is an option to run a download that will ANALYZE your computer and tell you if you can play this game or not! Doing this also provides you with all the information about your sound and video cards. This was so helpful. It's a tiny download and it's free. Took it 60 seconds to check my comp. I failed sadly, but it even gives to links to places where you can get the right cards. GO HERE FIRST!"
5,"Great game for families, clever design","A great shooting game that is appropriate for young children. Finding codes with the red view finder adds to the fun for kids. I thought including a foam dart launcher was unnecessary, but when my 9 year old was playing the video game and then asked if the gun could shoot real darts, I understood that the designers had done their research!"
4,A more than solid collection of the series,"For casual gamers, SNK's Art of Fighting franchise may not be as well known as their King of Fighters, Fatal Fury, or Samurai Showdown franchises, but that has never made it any worse.  The Art of Fighting Anthology collects the three games in the series that follow the fighting adventures of Ryo and Robert as they take to the streets.  The first game is the only one that has a storyline that makes any kind of relative sense (the pair are on the hunt for Ryo's kidnapped sister Yuri), but since when have you played a fighting game for the story?  All three games have been emulated relatively perfectly from their Neo Geo arcade counterparts, which is good and bad.  The first game suffers from a bit of slowdown and offers somewhat archaic controls, while the second game improves on this.  The third Art of Fighting game is undoubtedly the best and re-vamps the graphics and tweaks the gameplay as well, making this collection worth picking up for alone.  Though it would have been nice if some extras were included on the disc, the Art of Fighting Anthology is an excellent pick up for the price; and offers some great, old school 2-D fighting action that is still enjoyable to this day.  Like the Metal Slug Anthology before it, maybe SNK will release some of their other franchises (like Fatal Fury or Samurai Showdown) in compilation form for the PS2 before it finally goes to console heaven."
4,Color Issue? Kinda.,"I've always been a huge fan of Kontrol Freaks and these are great. The only qualm I have with these is that the color is a warmer white when compared to the PS5 controller. I know that it's not advertised that the colors match, but if you're buying these specifically thinking they will, they don't."
4,Bang for your buck!,"I know UFO has been known to publish horrible budget games for the Wii (I'm looking at you, ANUBIS 2!). But don't let this stop you from checking out BALLOON POP! I was pleasantly surprised by this game. It's a variation on the old ""match 3 of the same color"" puzzle type game but it does things right. It's easy to learn and the game is simple. Wait until you get to higher levels where the action gets frantic! The Wii remote was made for this type of game as you cascade the pointer over all the different balloons. Two player versus mode is a welcome addition and adds value and longevity to the game. Colorful graphics and bouncy music round out the package. Worth your twenty bones!"
5,Stick with Sony brand memory,"We bought a Mad Catz memory card, which was not recognized by our PS One. We then purchased a Sony Memory Card for PS One, which was recognized and asked if we wanted to format it. The PS One formatted the Memory Card and were able to save games such as Spyro: Year of the Dragon, Crash Bandicoot, and Spyro. The Mad Catz web site had suggested removing all but one controller and then trying it but we were pretty fed up at that point. Third Party memory may be cheaper, but it's certainly not better."
4,So much fun!,"I really love this gadget.  At forty-something, I'm a little embarrassed about how much I love it.  A holiday gift card inspired the purchase; I have to admit, using it to get this was one of the best things I've done for myself in a long time.  There are things in the modern, online Nintendo Switch universe that I wish were more clear.  Maybe all those things were a little more clearly spelled out, for early adopters, but I feel like I'm stumbling in the dark a bit.  A few days after I purchased a physical copy of Luigi's Mansion, I tried to claim points for it.  It returned a message saying the offer had expired, but I had only owned it a few days.  Another annoyance for people in the US with limited incomes is the transaction fees on digital purchases  (if your credit card company charges fees on foreign transactions).  Those little fees can add up.  At times, battery life seems to go quickly.  I'm going to try a few tablet tricks, like turning down screen brightness and disabling WI-FI.  Maybe this shows my age, but I miss the official, printed player's guides.  I only found two (Animal Crossing and Legend of Zelda Breath of Wild), and they were expensive.  I liked those guides, because they were a road map, but the good ones didn't spoil all the game play surprises.  I'm not really into the YouTube walk-through idea.  Even if I was, my ISP has a data cap.  Overall, I'm crazy about my new friend, my Nintendo Switch Lite.  Although, it would have been excellent to have the option to buy a purple one.  Lol"
4,Pros and cons,"Set up is a little bit of a hassle, not difficult, just having to plug in multiple devices in in an exact order. Also USB cable that comes included is way too short and should be much much longer. Problem with that is that it is the only cable you're supposed to use to connect it to the gaming console ,so having it longer is important, but note a USB extension cable does work and I would make sure you own one before you buy this product. Haven't tried remapping it yet but everything seems to work and does a good job of it"
5,Very well made,It was a little bit more than I usually spend on a converter but it is very well made and gives both my GameCube and super Nintendo a very good picture.  I bought it for an N64 but something went out on my 64 so I can't try it on there
1,"terrible choice EA, just a disappointment","On line play is fun, but just like any game you want to have something you are building and improving on. Fantasy draft franchise mode was the best thing in madden since I can remember. Why get rid of it. EA has made a huge mistake, they should make a downloadable update or something that installs it into the game. I would have never bought the game if I had known that EA had removed this game mode. Just a terrible decision. Get it right next year!"
5,Very functional,"Love this, super easy to install and hold everything from my switch (which I bought it for) to my ipad in its case.( 9.7 in ) It also fir my daughters 10.0 in tablet. Easy to get tablets in and out of sling. This will be great for our long road trip."
5,Good Prices,Good quality products just like the originals
2,This game is boring,"This is my first fallout game, and I bought into the hype. Maybe I am missing a fundamental part of the game, but what is so fun about searching for scrap and repetivily killing boring enemies?"
1,Gone to far...,"I pre ordered this new Spyro because I have had so much fun with all of the prior versions (except the last one).  This is not the Spyro I have followed and enjoyed.  It consists of constant battles rather than collecting, exploring and killing the cute characters smelling their armpits.  I am so discouraged that they would change something that has been so loved.  They should have left Spyro the way he was or at least changed the name so you would have a clue that this was not the same type of game.  You cannot go back to other worlds and it really has no exploring.  There is only one way to go and you have to battle every step of the way."
5,It docks!,"It docks! After buying the original soft case that didn't dock I decided to look for one that could and found this one. I also love it because of the hand hold bumps on the back of the joycons, it adds the extra stability that the switch is lacking while gaming for extended periods. One thing to note is that the center piece is a hard clear plastic while the joycons cover part is a soft plyable material"
1,very disappointed. No way for two players to play together ...,"I can't believe this game does not have split screen.  I bought it to play with my son, and am now sitting here watching him play it alone.  Very, very disappointed.  No way for two players to play together on same console."
2,"Same old story, different number in the name","So please tell me why millions of you would by this game if you've already played it in the past numerous times? We deserve better, and there wasn't even a decent promo to come with it. Honestly, not much difference at all between this and MW2 and Black Ops. I would give it a pass and see what they can come up with on a revamped engine and some new ideas."
4,son bought,"son really likes them fits very comfortable  and better than other pair he had and cheaper too ,and blocks out out side noise like dads voice"
1,Blue light problem and PS4 won't load!!!!!,Game DOA. Blinking blue light and I can't do an exchange because there are no more in stock. So I had to go through Sony and will have to wait 2-3 weeks. This is so not cool. Bought a second PS4 for my little brother and got the same issue. Blue light of death.. This is the worst system release by Sony and I am surprised they couldn't do proper quality check for this.....
5,Good privacy and easy installation,I received a replacement item and it works great. Good privacy and no air bubbles. Thank you!
1,Amazon wake up! Fix the picture!,"Should have read the other reviews. Image shown of 6 figures is not the description given. I received 3 random figures of a set of 32, not the 6 figures pictured. They used pictures of 6 figures. I expect 6 figures, not only 3."
5,Great Game!,My son loves this game!! I think it is a great game and makes kids think! All 4 of my kis ages 5-9 love it!! I would definitely purchase again all my kids love minecraft! Even the older ones 14-17!! I am a very happy customer!
5,Fantastic N64 accessory.,"This is one of the best accessories you can get.  As other reviewers have  said, it allows you to save your saves to computer.  This means that you  can save money on buying more memory cards, and you never have to worry  about your saves getting accidently erased, since you can have a permanent  backup on your computer.  You can transfer your saves and settings to your  friend's systems this way.  It's pretty easy to use and I've certainly got  no complaints."
4,Official and worth the money!,"This bag is definately worth the money.  It is super padded and fits everything for the 360. Its officially liscensed.  I bought this because I wanted to carry my 360 on the airplane with me.  Inside you can fit the power brick, the cables, 4 controllers, and the console.  My ony complaint is that if you have 4 controllers like I do, then you more than likely have to put other accessories such as headset, etc into another bag.  The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of five is because you cant really fit any games into it.  They should have made an extra zipper pouch on the front for games in my opinion.  You can definately fit one game though right next to the console.  And you shouldnt travel with a game in your 360, so if you are going to a friends house, you will need an extra bag or disc case for your games.  But overall it looks great and does what it is supposed to do and that is protect my 400 console.  I reccomend it to anyone traveling or for transporting it anywhere."
1,Don't buy this product! Xbox One,If I could give it zero stars I would. IT NEVER WORKED! The first console could not read game or movie disks. The replacement won't sync with the controllers. Microsoft tech support wanted me to take a controller to a store to test it on another console. I'm returning everything sticking with non-Microsoft game consoles. This is a total disappointment for my kids.
5,Great Game,"Another great game for Game Boy Advance (SP), especially nice on GBA SP. The action is good (similar to DK on Nintendo 64) and the graphical detail is impressive. Guaranteed to get you addicted, by maybe not as much as the N64 version. It allows three separate players, so you can get others addicted and compete with them as well."
5,Warning : Warcrack,"Only buy this game if you are independently wealthy and have no need for a job or any social life outside of the game.  WoW and the expansion together create a gaming force so powerful that you will not be able to resist playing.  It will vacuum out your soul and leave you an empty shell of a person, haggard and broken.  You will lose your apartment, spouse, job, and friends and end up shattered and desperate, mindlessly searching for an internet cafe so you can hook up your next fix.  At night, your fingers will twitch, clicking a phantom mouse as you dream of ore deposits and herbs that don't exist."
5,Cute UNdockable Case,I bought this as a replacement to a sticker skin and these rubbery cases are sooo much better! It's not dockable unless you really smash it down but I wouldn't recommend that! Find a usb to c cord instead and you won't need to dock to charge or get video to a tv :)
1,Terrible product and over priced,Terrible product has to be used with usb cable and loosely fits the controller. The brand is Aolion not Active Devices. It feels cheaply made and the fact you need to use it with usb cable makes it even more worthless.
5,It works !,"I hesitate to purchase this kit to repair my daughter's Nintendo Switch joycon thumbstick. However, I did not want to pay for a replacement Joycon; so, I took a chance on getting this repair kit. It does not cost an arm and a leg anyway.  As soon as I received it, I grabbed the joycon and started disassembling the blue (left) joycon. I stopped on the removal of the thumbstick because I am not sure how to remove the wire strips. I opened up the YouTube and seeks for instruction on how to remove the wiring strips. Once I found out how to remove the wire strips properly, everything went smooth! It is easy to remove and replace the joycon thumb stick. Then I proceeded to replace the thumbstick on the red (Right) joycon. It is very easy repair process."
1,Cheaters never win,"i bought this product fron toys r us. it looked like i could finally win the game i've been playin for ever. i hooked the computer cable into the gameboy.i started to look at cheats,when,the screen was blank.i tried everything,i returned it and got another 1,but the same thing happend again.i wanted to warn u about this product."
1,Literally unplayable,There are dogs. But you can not pet the dogs
1,The game has a lot of Technical issues and a lot of design problems,"The game has a lot of sub par graphics. It has loading issues, pop in issues, and a lot of stuttering and stopping. Design wise, the new pokemon are not good, they are very phoned in and very unintersting, and simply feel like they were rushed in doing them. The whole game feels extremely rushed. There is about 40 minutes of post game, there is an incredibly simply battle tower and thats it. The online modes suffer a lot from not having any meaniful or fun modes. The main story is incredibly easy, like no need to think easy mode, and only takes 8 hours. The main story is underwhelming and border line just bad. Plz Plz do not buy this game. Its not worth it."
1,What scum.,What scum.
5,Fantastic,"I first played RR Tycoon 2 Platinum at a friend's house and was hooked.  This is a game that gives you the player a realistic and challenging railroading experience and at the same time does not overwhelm you with details.  The scenarios in this game are fantastic, the only problem I have is that you can't build tunnels or stone bridges in the 1830's for the 1st scenario with the B and O.  Other than those small problems this game is great!"
2,Misleading- this is the SNES MINI,"The product doesn't say it's the mini and the blurb up top doesn't give any indication it's the mini. You have to read product information, way down below, before you realize that the top info hasn't disclosed it's the mini. Save yourself the error. Probably works fine- but they should really say it's the mini, because with that photo and the info up top...."
5,A Must Buy !!,"1 of the coolest Birthday gifts Ive ever recieved !!  I had researched these for awhile  and it seemed to me the best value is the 12 in 1 Deluxe!! So much more for your money and it has been a huge attraction during parties and get togethers !!  Beautiful artwork, AMaZING Games, a Awesome Purchase !!"
5,Worth the money!,"I love it! It works so well hearing not only the game, but I can use it for my iPad and phone to talk to others! It's so well crafted and no you do not need the Xbox One adapter that connects to the bottom of the controller. (If you have the earphone jack installed)"
1,Ridiculous pricing,I paid 200 for my oclus im not paying 150 for a controller
1,If you want to save your kids life don't buy.,After comparing the cost of this thing the price was jacked up high. I suggest not to buy this plus it over heated and caught on fire and burnt my kids room wall and my son suffered 2nd degree burns. Have a lawyer working on law suit against this merchant. If you want to save ypur kids life dont buy from this company or this product.
5,I have always had good luck with my Amazon purchases,"I have always had good luck with my Amazon purchases, however I am tired of giving product reviews and receiving no incentive for them."
5,Love it!,I just love this. It is cool looking and fun to play for the whole family. I even gave mine a cool nick name. And games are so much fun to play and take a long while to beat all the games that come on the discs.
5,"It Works Nicely, and Affordable","As soon as my kids saw this controller, they starting talking smack about how it did not look like an Xbox one controller, didn't even have the light up ""X"" button. I made them go plug it in and try it out. As expected, it works perfectly. All buttons are functional. I am pleased with this purchase, and should another controller stop working, I will likely buy another one of these."
4,Indy hits the DS in style,"Lego Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures comes to the DS in style thankfully, leaving all the problems of the last Lego-based DS game (Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy) behind, even though it uses that game's graphics engine.  If you are at all familiar with the Lego Star Wars games though, you'll feel right at home with Lego Indiana Jones, as the game provides the same kind of charming, goofy humor that the other games did.  Playing through the first three Indy episodes, Lego Indiana Jones is pretty lengthy and features a ton of unlockable characters, meaning you'll be busy for some time, which is a big plus as well.  The game looks pretty good and makes good use of John Williams' classic score, and there is some surprisingly great use made of the DS' touch screen capabilities and microphone.  While Lego Indiana Jones is instantly enjoyable, it should be noted that if you've played Lego Star Wars at all, you'll notice how this is basically the same game with the Indy license slapped on it in place of Star Wars.  This isn't such a bad thing if you dug those games, but if you didn't for some reason, Indy won't win you over any.  All in all though, Lego Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures is instantly enjoyable, family friendly fun that anyone can get into and enjoy."
2,Very underwhelming and  disappointing,"I was very disappointed in the game.  I am about 45 minutes in and the graphics and gameplay really aren't anything other than modern warefare replication.  I have always loved Cod.  But they bombed this one, and I think the franchise has plateaued."
1,No fun at all !,"This game has great graphics, but gameplay wise is so  difficult, even on the easiest mode I was ready to quit halfway through the 3rd level. To much clumsy platforming, bullet sponge enemies, you need reflexes like a cat, and still that's not good enough!! Unrewarding gameplay, We finally get a ID game in 4k for the ps4 and it has to be something like this!!! This game is in bad need of an  invincability  code so less challenged players can actually get somewhere. My favorite types fps are like Bioshock, Rage, far cry 5, I was hoping  this game would be more like doom3, but sadly not, and don't get me started on why there is no quick save feature, if ever a game needed one it's this one. Instead you get killed over and over and have to replay from checkpoints way back there, and I mean waaay  back there. I will hang on to it to see if any useful cheat codes surface, if not I will be selling it off! At least doom64 has all the cheats as the n64 version did, and that's what I've been playing instead. ( check with cheat code central) for codes. Otherwise I am  passing on this one!"
1,Literal junk,We have the Xbox series s controllers and it just hardly works. The first one didn't work at all so we returned it for a replacement and on this one the back one works okay(with some finagling) and the front one won't do more than flash for a moment with pressure on it. Going to do a full return at this point. Waste of money. Feels cheap and functions the same.
5,You need this for your nes,Perfect to extend the very short cord for the nes classic.
1,Price inflation,Complete inflation. This console is 299 not over 500!!
1,your kidding right,iam not going to buy a game for that price that forces you to connect to the internet.. ill buy it if you add an offline mode.. the game looks really fun hope you reconsider adding an offline mode if not i will not waste my money.
1,DO NOT BUY!,Please do not buy this.
1,"Cheap, and just complete garbage","I was excited when I got it 4 days early but when I took it out of the box I knew instantly that I didn't like it. It feels like it's made with a cheaper plastic, doesn't feel heavy enough. Just overall I don't like that aspect, the second thing is MY product had a messed up micro usb input, it would constantly disconnect at different angles and was really annoying. I am sending this back and getting the old version. Would not recommend but you can press your luck and maybe yours will work just fine."
1,False advertising,The company is selling the European version and advertising the north american version thats bait and switch false advertising
1,Good and terrible,Good surround sound headphones. Microphone from an analog home phone from the 1940s. This microphone is terrible.
1,One Star,Your out of your damn mind
1,One Star,"hinge break after 2 month.  Then,  it will break in several parts....well you can always use duct tape to fix this piece of crap."
5,You need to know that Nintendo DESTROYED this game,"Earthbound... This is a game that I remember enjoying immensely back in the day. Unfortunately, it has now been plunged into obscurity and receives very little respect from new age gamers that happen to come across it. Despite that, though, you might be a bit surprised to learn that this game was the source of a considerable amount of hype prior to its release. I remember Nintendo Power Magazine, which was one of the leading authorities of video games back then, did a pretty big promotion for this game. Sadly, this promotion probably did more to hurt the game's image than anything else. What NP tried to do was, they tried to play off the game's humorous and quirky nature. They ended up having these scratch and sniff cards that had stuff like dirty sock scent and things like that which came out in a special pull out section of the magazine. It was done with good intentions, but needless to say, I don't think it did very much to boost the game's image.  NP's coverage of the game also did its part to hurt the game's stock. I remember that the coverage they did on it was really weird. It wasn't a normal walkthrough like they did with virtually every other game they've ever featured. There were no strategies, no hints or tips, no maps, nothing like that. There was never any kind of coverage like that.  Basically what they did was, they had in-depth journalism type feature about this odd unconventional RPG that was wrecking the standards for RPGs everywhere. If you read through it really carefully and you have a bit of background knowledge about the game, then you can kind of tell that it was just meant to be a big joke, but if you didn't know much about it (which at the time, most people didn't, since it had just been released) then it really looks like NP was just slamming this game. At the beginning it said ""we suggest psychiatric guidance"" for anyone who reads this review or something like that, and it went on to explain ""how Earthbound will destroy civilization as we know it"". At the very end it said, ""Not only does the game of Earthbound reek like some foul creature of the sewers, but Nintendo has made the product even more repulsive with the Player's guide that comes packaged with the game."" I swear that's literally what it says, and if you don't believe it then you can look in volume 73 of Nintendo Power Magazine from June 1995, if you can still find it. Folks, you really have to remember the impact that this magazine had on the video gaming world at the time. In the mid-nineties, Nintendo was the biggest gaming company in the world, unlike nowadays. I believe this is the single biggest reason why this game is now largely forgotten because the fact is, there were quite a few people back in the day who were really looking forward to this release. As soon as it came out, though, the hype was gone and the game's legacy would soon follow. As for the game itself though, it plays pretty much like many other RPG's, but to be honest it is a kind of quirky game. For those of you who are thinking about ordering this game or playing it and never played it the first time around, or for those who just didn't get it in the first place, you really have to put the game in the context of when it came out. Earthbound was released amid the golden age of RPG's. You had all these overblown, dramatic games coming out like Zelda, Chrono Trigger, all those Final Fantasys, the Secret of Mana, the Secret of Evermore, and the list goes on and on. What the developers of Earthbound sought to do was to create a satire of games like this. Instead of having the Masamune or the Master Sword, you had baseball bats and frying pans. Instead of fighting a race of Moogles or a mythical dragon, you fight hippies and snakes and retail store managers. This game was to RPG's what the Dead Kennedys were to punk rock, or what Pulp Fiction was to the 90's movie scene. No, the developers of this game were not nuts; they were just trying to poke fun at what was becoming an increasingly overwhelming and overblown trend. But somewhere in all that, they created a game that was truly one of kind, fun, addicting, and as far as I'm concerned, one of the best games ever released for any system. It's just a shame that Earthbound will never be remembered that way."
1,Renewed how?,"Aight, so I don't usually throw flak but when I do it's warranted, the controller I got was considered renewed, I wanna ask renewed how because there was disgusting dirt, tar, and what looked like soda caking everything, upon disassembly I found an area on the controller where the shell had broken and a shard of the broken part was lodged in the X button making it unpressable and both joysticks have an immense dead zone where you can move them but no input is given, all of the parts in this controller are OEM as in never opened, so I ask again, how is this renewed cause the only renew I see is the renewed sale of an old but reliable controller but I digress"
5,Join Scooby and the Gang to Solve the Mystery!,"Scooby Doo fans should take right to this game where you and Scooby (choose from either Shaggy, Freddy, Daphne, or Velma) are out searching for clues to find who is the Fun Park Phantom!  Find clues, ask mysterious  characters for help, and of course there are Scooby Snacks!  For older  fans any single game shouldn't take too long.  For the younger fans (under  10) this can be a really fun challenge in problem solving that shouldn't  take more than an hour to solve. The game is point and click and has the  appearance of an aerial view of the cartoon.  And for the most part it does  look like the cartoon.  The video sequences (at least on my computer) are  very poorly dubbed and all in all the game has limited replay value due to  the small number of suspects.  But if you're a Scooby Doo fan the price is  nice for the entertainment and nostalgic value this game does have, putting  you right smack dab in the middle of a genuine Scooby Doo mystery!  Go  get it now!"
5,Great budget controller,"The build quality of the controller is nice and sturdy, similar to the official dual-shock controller. Controls are nice and responsive. The only thing that I would love it to have would be an audio port, but for the price one can't complain."
5,Delicious candy,Delicious candy and always the hit at a party.
1,Extremely Disappointed,"Very briefly, I pre-ordered this game and when it arrived I couldn't wait to install it and start playing, then I realized it was a Steam game, I have other games that use Steam and lets just say that I am not a fan. But after loading I jumped right in and came crashing to a halt, my core 2 duo, 2GB ram laptop was unable to run the game in the normal map mode, I can only run the game in the low res strategic mode and then it crashes on me. I realize that it's my video card limitations that that are probably the root cause, but still it made for a disappointing purchase."
5,Much more than I expected,I spent hours looking through the Ben 10 Omnitrix Watches and such for my 6 year old son's birthday. And since it's so difficult to really figure out what they do online I was very worried that we'd get something crappy. However we were very pleased with it and so was my son. He runs all over the house with it. It actually does quite a lot more things than any of the other ones I looked at said they did. For any parent who has a son or even a daughter that is into Ben 10 this is the one to get. That is unless you have the money to buy some of the more expensive ones that I can't vouch for. But this one is great. So happy we went with this one.
4,Good product,"Works great, fit is kind of tight"
4,A very different 4X game,"Okay, the previous review was very harsh and sounded as if they expected a MoO or SEIV clone.  To get a better of idea of the strategy portion of this game, think of a boardgame.  It's very simplistic (only one planet per star)in the sense that it is like controlling squares of a board.  The planets are really there to fund your research and ship building.  Of course, you can place defenses around them and station ships there, but there is no city building options like in most games of this type.  The meat of the game is the RTS ship-to-ship battles.  At first, they appear relatively simplistic, but as new technologies become available, you start to see the implications of ship building.  For instance, ships have weapons banks on each side, top, and sometimes bottom with various firing arcs.  So, you may wish to pass an enemy ship instead of going head-on to get a particular weapon group to deal damage.  You can also target specific sections or weapons on the ship.  So, if a particular weapon is giving you grief, you can target it specifically.  As an example, I had a Tanker ship that the AI destroyed the refueling portion of the ship, which stranded my ships in that area of space.  Finally, there are random elements to the strategic game that can affect planets in big ways (think of the episode Doomsday from Star Trek TOS).  There's nothing like showing up in a system and finding a long-dead alien civilization's defensive structure still in operation."
5,Nice Switch Controller that works perfectly!,Great purchase! I'm very satisfied with this controller. I now use it to play with all of my games on my Nintendo switch. I love the color and the feel of the grip is perfect! Definitely recommend it to all Switch players!
1,Disgusting,Wow really!? Over a thousand dollars for a refurbished Xbox? What a clown show
5,AMAZING GAME!!!,This game is another wonderful addition of the 2013 sports games and takes the game play of Basketball above and beyond!
1,"Lots of Hype, lets see it deliver....","Ok, im not doubting id, but lets see the game bfore we give it 100 5star reviews......"
4,Good Replacement Item with One Important Detail,"This item installs okay and is functional for the Xbox One S Wireless Controller.  The only thing is during the soldering installation you might think that it isn't seated fully on the board due to some posts on the bottom of the component which prevents it from installing the same way the OEM analog stick does.  Once I realized it was through the alignment holes as far as it would go, I soldered it on and reassembled the controller and everything works fine."
4,Only fishing game for DS...,"I came in with high expectations from all the fun I had playing Black Bass for the NES.  At first, I hated this game.  The first several times I plugged it in, I could not catch a single fish.  All they ever did was dart around the hook, seemingly mocking me for my incompetence.  Eventually, I got the hang of it and learned to read the 'mind' information that popped up and could manage to hook the fish.  The whole mind concept is pretty dumb if you ask me, since you really can't read minds when you are fishing, though you can make an educated guess at what the fish want.  But if you give it a chance, this game is a pretty fun fishing game, and is way better than Rapella Pro Fishing for GBA."
5,Plug it in And Play your old Wii on new HDMI TVs!,"This upgraded version Wii to HDMI converter came with everything needed to plug it directly into the Wii in place of the old-style TV cable and run directly to the HDMI connector of my TV.  The upscaled image is nice and crisp and looks great on the 75"" Samsung TV we have it connected to.  Sound comes through to the TV and is good and clear.  This device really brings the Wii back to life for newer TVs!  Some small items to note:  First, the farther away from the TV the more the pointer will jiggle (see Wii Settings to adjust this a bit).  The HDMI output works but is not recognized by the TV as belonging to any group of game devices (would have been nice to at least have it recognized as a game)."
1,"Bad product, even worst product support","The stand broke down within 60 days from the date of purchase. Amazon states that warranty is covered by the manufacturer. So tried contacting Ortz. As per Ortz's product page the item is covered by 180 days warranty coverage so I tried to get Ortz to cover the warranty. Emailed them several times, without response. When someone finally got back to me he said that I had to get support from the company that sold it. When I replied stating that was Ortz who sold it I got a reply like that was a different department. Stay away from anything that this company sells. They don't stand behind their products."
1,Dont buy this game,In order to play this game online everybody else must have a PS5. I called Playstation to get a refund or credit to buy the normal Madden 21 and they wouldnt refund or credit me. There isnt enough people that have the PS5 to play with.
1,WoW has become nothing more then a never-ending grind...,"After playing through WoTLK, hitting 80, raiding and getting geared, I finally just stopped one day and said ""Why am I playing this game?""  All the game is, is one long grind session...whether you're grinding for experience, grinding for gold, grinding for pvp points, grinding for gear, grinding for rep, etc.  And then once you have all epic items and think all the grinding is behind you, GUESS WHAT?  An expansion pack or patch comes out and you have to grind all over again for your end game gear, rep, gold, etc.  This game is an enormous time sink and at the end of the day what did you really accomplish?"
5,Very fun for casual!,"This is a very fun, very addicting game. You get four casual games. Some of the games have other game types to play, like ""Normal"" ""Challenge"" ""Puzzle"" ""Timed"" mode. Just by looking at the pictures on the box, you can tell your getting similar games to Jewel Quest, Zuma, Mystery Case Files, and Diner Dash. Instead of taking care of customers at a diner, you will take care of customers at a salon. I have been playing this for over a few weeks now, and it's just so easy to pick up and play for a few minutes or for hours, and for the price...I have to say it's well worth it."
1,Sony I never it had be this hard to purchase a ps5,Sony are really playing mind games on people
2,Nice but something is a little wrong.,Missing the letter C.
5,"Great battery, NOT compatible with the standard issue switch charger!!","Amazing battery for the switch. For all those who are saying its not charging, you CANNOT use the charger that came with the switch. It will NOT work. Luckily i have a note 9 with USB type C, and it works just fine. I get a good 6-8 extra hours off the battery. Grip feels amazing if you like the heavy bulky grip feeling. Reminds me of holding a GameGear from my childhood."
5,This mom approves! (for herself lol),"I got this for my son for Christmas, and he had already played it I guess (irritated emoji face).. so I decided to try it on his playstation one evening while my daughter was sleeping, and fell in love with this game! They have different difficulty levels, there are awesome things you could do instead of just fight. The krypt is my favorite place. The story line is really fun, and keeps you entertained for hours on end! Keep in mind I'm not a gamer at all.. I'm a 32 year old mom of three lol. So I have to believe if I enjoy this game, a lot of other people will enjoy this game as well."
1,"Works great, except for voice chatting","I have been using this for months for gaming, and it works great. It will not work with any voice chat program that I have tried. The mic is fine, but no audio will come through the headset. I've tried it with Zoom, Discord, Roll 20, and Webex, and all of them have the same issue. If you just want to listen to music, watch movies and game, this is great. Anything where the mic is useful, you can't hear anything."
1,Decent controller for a couple months,"Mine lasted 5 months, now the right trigger doesn't depress entirely and the left analog stick drifts. I wouldn't be upset if this was a noname brand but I paid more than double the cost of a random cheapy controller and got the same cheap quality. I don't consider myself a heavy user- I use the controller a couple days a week, 3 at maximum , roughly 3 hr sessions. This is not a well built controller."
1,and a lot are pretty low.,"The whole point of buying a non download version is so we don't have to download the blasted thing. Most people in the US have DL caps, and a lot are pretty low."
1,0 stars!!!,TOTAL waste of money
5,UPDATE: Great customer service following nonfunctional product,"I ordered this charger back in Dec 2018 and loved it. Not only did it charge my MacBook well, it could also charge two other devices at the same time, sparing me the need for extra bricks and saving outlet space. However, four months later, it completely stopped working. I reached out to the company through Amazon telling them I now had a defective charger and within minutes (on a weekend!), they replied asking me for the shipping address to send a new one since I was within warranty. I received the new charger two days later and I'm back up and running! Having great customer service like this company does gave me confidence in this product and felt risk free to try it out. I'd gladly recommend this product to anyone looking for a more affordable macbook charger knowing that there's great customer service to back up any issues that may arise with swift and hassle free solution."
5,best windows controller i have used.,"Works great with both xbox and pc wireless and no additional purchase required since it also supports  bluetooth. Pretty much plug and play. It is a Microsoft product, and if you buy from Amazon you can return it if it is defective or have some damage in shipping of course. Just glancing though the reviews that seemed to be an issue in some cases. This is a high quality controller with a ton of versatility. it has a replaceable battery so you aren't locked in like Sony. you can buy high quality Li-on batteries after market for minimal cost. I have a ps4, and an Xbox. Over my years I have used many controllers, for pc, game consoles etc. To be honest those two platforms have the best controllers by a wide margin. They never fail, and they work great. Basically they last forever. If I had to choose between the two i'd pick xbox because of the pc versatility, and replaceable battery. it truly is a great controller. You can look at this as a long term investment. So of my favorite controllers, in comparing sony to this controller the reason i'd recommend this is they make the battery replacement easier."
5,Perfect Match!!!,"The Scribblenauts and DC Universe are a perfect match. The game has great puzzles, colorful graphics and a great sense of imagination. If you are a fan of the original, you will love this game. If you are a fan of the original and DC, you'll worship this game. The possibilities are almost endless. Buy this now! The Wii U is on a roll now and if you don't own one, you are missing some of the most unique and fun games that have been put out in years."
4,"Didn't know what I was getting, but glad I took a chance!","I had trouble finding much information about this game anywhere, so I was not really sure what kind of game I would be getting, but I have to say its great!  At 32 I wanted a salon type game that I could enjoy and not feel like it was completely aimed at a younger audience.  I just received it yesterday and am having a ton of fun with it.  You are a stylist in a salon and each customer needs a different service.  You give massages, facials, manicures, pedicures, hair styling and apply makeup.  The game makes good use of the stylus as far as applying make up and nail polish, and doing hair and massages.  It also has great use of the microphone as far as blowing into it to use the blow dryer and dry nails.  Overall, I am extremely happy with this purchase.  It seems like I will get quite a bit of play out of this as when the career mode is finished, you can complete challenges and also there is a free play mode to play around with all of the different salon services.  I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys hair and makeup."
1,Dont buy,I am one of apparently thousands that have received a defective console. Did not work out of the box.  Reading all of the negative reviews on the xbox one makes me feel that Microsoft was more concerned with getting the product out on a deadline that if it actually worked.  If your dead set on buying one I would wait a year for all of the bugs to get worked out.
5,Great idea!,"I originaly ordered the BBA to connect to PSO online on a private server, then i realised with a certain proxy i can play SSB:M online! GREAT PRODUCT! you can also hook your GC's up with friends with mario kart:Double Dash"
1,Retro look is great... Too bad it doesn't work,"I was so ticked off when I received my two joysticks and found out within the first 30 seconds of play that these are only for looking at, not for actually using.  Simply put, this joystick attaches to your device with a single suction cup which does not keep the joystick in place whenever pressure is added to direct the movement of your on screen character.  The Fling has multiple suction cups that are not directly at the point where you apply pressure to use the controller, thus it stays in place.  When you try to move in any direction using this joystick, lets say to the right, pressure to the right side of the joystick will initially start moving your character to the right.  Sadly your joystick also moves right until it slides off of the onscreen controller.  I really wanted this to work because it took me back to tmy arcade days, but sadly, the people who made this were only concerned with making a cool looking joystick and never thought about how it should work.  Save your money!"
1,where do i get my money back?,If the screen was any smaller i would say put it on my wrist as a watch. What use is d3 if you need a magnifying glass to see anything. Every picture made me think it was going to be the size of the dsXL but it was even smaller than the ds light. Call me when it grows up.
5,Decent purchase,"Decent purchase, not so pleased with the cord length, other than that all is good"
1,piece o crap,"BUYER BEWARE --- DO NOT PURCHASE!  This nunchuk did not work for even 60 days before it just stopped registering with the Wii.  Also, the Z button would only respond if the player pressed it in a very specific way.  This nunchuk is junk - just spend a couple extra dollars and buy a real one from Nintendo than this piece o crap.  The manufacturer must have known it was crap too because they didn't even include their name or contact information with the device."
1,Just Horrible,"This is the worst Nintendo handheld game I have ever seen.  Not just the worst of the DS games, but the worst of all the Gameboy games.  It is rated E for everyone, but if a child plays it in solo mode, the screen scrolls by so fast that no 6 or 7 year old will be able to read it.  The wireless gameplay for people without the card is a joke.  The pictochat that comes free is better."
1,Nice looking. Terrible function.,"Awkward angles to the ""pages"" because the case wont stay wide open when accessing the first panel. It will only open to about 95 degrees. Which would be a big deal if it didn't hold onto your games so tight you can barely get them out. I have to use a thumbnail to pry the little tab away from the cartridge while using another nail to pull the cartridge outward. No kid is going to be able to get these games out."
1,Crap,"One of worst games I have ever played. Tiresome, repetitive, absurdly hard and not in a challenging way. How is it fun to go down the same road over and over and over  again killing the same set of baddies. It's a game for people with way more time on their hands than I have and an extremely high threshold for banal repetition."
1,Non recommend,I have had this thing for a few months now and I've only tried to play at about six or seven times. It is so frustrating and I end up turning it off every time because all it does is update. We never actually get to play because of all the updating it does it is ridiculous it is constantly restarting and updating. I tried calling Xbox and got nowhere their customer service is awful. I hate this thing and would not recommend to anyone.
5,Response time,Great response time
5,Fastest bloodiest mouse on the planet.,"My thirteen year old had a perfectly good mouse that he bought like 2 years ago, but when he gets a little cash in his pocket BOOM he has to spend it.  So, here we are, buying this mouse because ""It drag clicks better"". I don't know what a drag click, is but if you like that sort of thing, this is apparently the mouse for you.  Heartily endorsed by one 13 year old Minecraft addict in my basement."
5,The Birth of A Legend- Straight Into Your Hands,"When I was a small bean first playing Halo: Combat Evolved on the XBox, my tiny child fingers could barely repel the seething Covenant hordes of Easy as I struggled to use the fat, stumpy-armed controller. As I graduated to middle school and the XBox 360, I thought I had found perfection as I fought desperately to save Earth from the onslaught of the great teeming scourge of the Parasite. This lasted into high school as I valiantly strove to survive the Legendary  glassing of Reach and tear down the mighty Didact after wading through a sea of Promethean constructs. But nothing I had ever experienced could have prepared me for Halo 5: Guardians. The controller first felt alien in my hands, but with an appealing sense of mystery. As I, along with members of loyal Blue team and valiant Osiris, struggled against the threat of the Created and sought to unravel the mystery, the XBox One controller came to life in my hands. Every trigger pull was sharper, every grenade flew more true, and the feedback received from reloading made me feel truly alive for the first time. This controller- emblazoned with the tried and true sage green of John's MJOLNIR battle armor with beautiful visor-colored accents and the symbol of the UNSC printed on the center... This controller, with its laser- etched hexagonal texture and contoured grips that mold perfectly into your palms... This controller, with its beautifully sculpted thumbsticks and perfectly angled triggers, will bring out the SPARTAN-II in everyone. This controller will help you finish the fight."
5,"I got this for my kids, and they don't like it. lol","But... I love it! Reminds me of Mario back when I was a kid, so I find myself playing it more than my kids do. I guess that's alright though!"
5,Holds up well and even a 7 year old can put it on.,Bought this for my granddaughter to go with a controller I also purchased for her and she loves it. It is holding up well under a 7 year olds use. Will definitely purchase others as new controllers are added.
1,Terrible,"This game has probably the worst ending to any video game ever, it completely destroys the series. BioWare should be ashamed."
5,These Filters are Perfect for the DS Lite!,"If you are looking for screen protectors for your DS Lite, then these are the ones you want to get.  I tried using the ones that came in the Pelican package and they were crap.  Unlike them, the Hori Screen Protectors (or filters as they are called here)went on easy, with NO air bubbles.  They have stayed on solidly, even with much use of the DS's stylus pen, and you cannot even tell that the filters are on there.  These things are great!!!"
5,Nostalgia at it's best,My brother asked my why I bought this and I said it's because I loved Spyro growing up. He said I'm just all about that nostalgia and it was dumb. Fast forward several ours later of returning home after work and there he is playing. He then admitted it is an incredible game and so fun to play.
1,Overpriced and underperforms.,"Really disappointed with this product. I wasn't expecting any jaw dropping difference so it's not like I had unrealistic expectations. I booted up my GameCube with the original cables and with the GCHD Mk-II and an HDMI cable back-to-back to see the difference. To my shock, I noticed NO difference in image quality. If anything, it made the image worse as there were visual artifacts on both sides of the screen when using the GCHD that were not present when using the original cables. I will be returning the unit for a refund."
5,Good sound. Battery last about 10hrs of use,Good sound. Battery last about 10hrs of use
1,Missing volumes,There is supposed to be 5 books. I only received the first three. I received no notification that the other two are being shipped separately.
1,Sucks,This game is really bad. I wouldn't pay 10 bucks for it.  Wish I would of read the reviews  first.  The gba sims is better even the ds version is better then this.  Really disappointed in it.
4,Gamepad,This controller is the same as an Xbox 360 Controller with a twist.  It is Stormin' Cherry in color and is transparent.  This controller is also compatible with the PC.  When connected to a personal computer you can customize all the butttons except for the guide button.  The guide button acts like more of a help button on the PC.  It opens the Xbox Accesories help window.  You can also use the controller accessories on your computer.  With full vibration feedback you will feel every action that you do or is done to you.  None of the buttons are hard to press and they aren't too sensitive.  I would recommend this to anybody looking to enhance their PC gaming experience.
2,Oh man....,"Doom was a difficult enough game with the keyboard, but on your PDA this game is just plain hard.  It's just too hard to play with a PDA D-Pad and have any success at all.  This was totally not the game for me and I shouldn't have bought it.  Honestly, FPS is not the thing you want on your PDA.  The better choice would be something like Simcity 2000 or that Everquest Game.  Something that is primarily played with the stylus because hammering your D-Pad with a game like this will ruin it forever.  No sense in damaging your PDA."
5,Love this game!,"I love this game! I used to really enjoy playing Harvest Moon, but this game blows Harvest Moon out of the water! There's more to do in this game, including combat.The story is better. I'm currently in Year 3, and all I want to do is keep playing. With the different farm sites as well as the different marriage options, this game has infinite replayability. I usually only get to play this game after putting my kids to bed. It's a great way to unwind after a long day. Would highly recommend!"
1,Junk times two,"Sent the first one back because it shorted right away.  Got the replacement, and just like the other reviewers stated, it fried too.  Crap product, I would advise to amazon to remove from their product list."
1,Where's The Plot?,"I know there is a lot of hype for this game. The new GTAIII Vice City is supposed to be another hit with newer cars and things of that nature. But Aside from all the killing and blowing up stuff, is there really anything else that captures the immagination in this game? I've seen friends play this over and over again saying how great it is. So I get it and play it. After 20 min of missions of killing things and blowing stuff up with practically no sense of purpose and any form of variety in the missions, I had to uninstall this game. Its horrible!!!  If you love games where its mindless killing (filled with great codes I should add), then go for it. But If you need a plot with an actual challenge that stimulates the mind, then you might want to go another route."
5,Best Hand Held Gaming System Ever!,"Many people try to tell me that the Sony PSP is the best consule. Well let me tell you Nintendo has really raised the bar! The DS Lite is wonderful! Its new sleek design doesn't make it appear to bulky and with a new glossy finish it really lets you show it off. Also for you first timers, the DS allows you to have two games in the system at the same time. A DS game and a GBA. However, the only thing that I see wrong with the device is that you can't play Gameboy Color games on it. So don't give away your GBA unless you are finished playing your GBC games. Anyways, the graphics are AWESOME and the stylus really is a nice touch that Nintendo added. Compared to the first DS model, on the Lite the buttons have been moved to fit more comfortably. However seeing that I didn't own a previous model I can't really say that this improved anything. But I can say that buttons do fit nicely in place with my grip. I like how when you first turn the game on it asks for time, date, your birthday (it only does this because some games will use your birthday-ex: Trace Memory.),what color you want the background, give a name for your DS, and add a personal message. Also if you are around a lot of people, there is Pictochat. You can use the stylus to write messages or you can just type it out using the directional buttons and the A button to confirm. The new brighter screen really is fantastic. Since the last hand held I owned was a GBA this new screen was like a dream come true! No longer do you need a light in the dark to continue playing because the screen has like a built in light. AWESOME right? SO anyone out there who tries to tell me the PSP is better clearly has not yet experienced the great wonders of the DS! Nintendo is clearly the best for hand held systems. Even though i believe that Sony has the best gaming consules for your house(PS, PS2. PS3). But that is another review. Get the DS Lite you will not regret it!"
5,Kinect adapter - for the right price.,"My package was delivered right on time for the celery service I requested. The item I received was for my Xbox one X connect, an adapter to for the kinet in order to use it on my Xbox one X. I knew I had purchased this product knowing it was used. It was nearly packaged and has very little to minor wear and tare. The adaptor worked and had no problems."
4,Street Fighter Alpa 3 Max,The Japanese version of this game is supposed to have different names for certian characters. It's been that way since Street Fighter II if you have done your history. This game is one of the last great Street Fighters. Huge cast and lots of fun on the go or in your own home! Highly recommended.
1,Crashed constantly on my PC,"Would not run on my GTX Titan Black, 32GB RAM, Windows 7 PC for more than 3 seconds without crashing.  I tried everything.  I reinstalled it, I repaired it, I moved it to my C drive, I moved it to my desktop, I updated my Nvidia drivers, I uninstalled my Nvidia drivers in safe mode and did a clean reinstall of them, I ran a memcheck, I replaced my memory chips.  Nothing worked and I ended up having to return the game.  I literally cannot remember the last time I had to return a video game.  I imagine it worked for most other people, but simply would not work at all for me."
5,Best Football Game on SNES,"This is the best football game. It is soooo fun. It has the best mode to make your own players, you get points to put at different skills; and they don't start out as stars you have to make them play good, then they might get better. Has a pretty good mode for being the GM for your team. I have played hours and hours with my freinds on this. The only bad things about this game is that the computer is pretty easy to beat the computer once you know how to play the game, and the rosters are old now, and the game play is not vwery realistic but that doesn't matter because it's so fun. If they made a new version of this game with updated rosters it would crush the competition on the fun factor."
5,Great headset for a decent price,"Great sound. Improves my game just as much as vibration does. This is my first serious headset, which I needed because the default one that Microsoft makes is too quiet and I just bought a Xbox One S. I love this headset because it matches my console and works well with the 3.5 mm jack. I've heard problems with the older ones breaking controller. Definitely worth checking this one out."
1,Joystick Stuck Drifting,"I purchased this controller to replace my daughter's PowerA that was stuck with joystick drift. My daughter's previous PowerA lasted approximately six months (from Christmas until the end of April). We had the new controller for less than a month and the joystick is stuck drifting to the left. After researching how I could fix it, I discovered this is a very common problem with the PowerA brand. I sincerely do not recommend it. Luckily, Amazon was very good about refunding my money."
1,Nothing like  Final Fantasy,This game is nothing like Final Fantasy :(
5,Wow!,"Let me just say this is the headset you need! Owned a TB stealth 520 and another Turtle beach headset for PC (wired).....I thought they were great until the PS4s broke. This product is built to last, great sound, breathable, simple, and it has the best ear pads i have tried.....ears dont sweat with this product. Must buy if your looking for serious quality!"
5,Perfect.,Title says it all.
1,Birthday,"My kid's 7th birthday is coming up, was going to get him one of these but since these horrible people are over charging, I had to explain to my 7 year old that he will get one at some point but not now cause mom isnt going to pay double. Shameful company!"
1,Does not work,"Tried to download for an hour.  No longer want, would like a refund but there is nowhere to request that."
1,Just wish they would have made an effort,I wish the original xbox games were backwards compatible with the xbox one so I could just play those instead. They are 10x better than this garbage.
1,Wiping out bad reviews,I find it appalling that Amazon would remove one star reviews for this game when people should know the truth about a product that they are interested in.
5,and was a great addition to my collection,"This amiibo drops wooden weapons, wooden shields, meats, and veggies. The figure is well crated, and was a great addition to my collection."
1,"Steam -- Just Say ""No""","I started with Civ II, and have played through every version since. Civ V is a teriffic game, but it's association with Steam ruins it. I always considered Steam to be merely annoying, but that was when it worked. It doesn't work anymore, so I naively thought I could fix the problem by uninstalling it and reinstalling it on my pc. I quickly learned that the entire game is now permanently disabled. Steam will not allow me to reinatall, nor will Steam respond to my inquiries. Apparently, the only way to get the game back is to buy it again and hope that Steam will allow me to install it. And if I'm lucky, I can look forward to another year or so of being annoyed with Steam. I will never purchase anything associated with Steam again."
5,Lots of glitter! Case covers SD Slot.,"This is a great protector! It fits the switch light perfectly. It is glittery. And not the kind of glitter that will come off. It's inside the plastic. The only downside is that the cover goes over the MicroSD slot. You cannot open the slot once the cover is on. So I would suggest putting your memory card in before applying the cover. I would also suggest putting the top portion of the cover, over the buttons, on first and then the bottom to make it easier on yourself."
1,Steam requirement a killer for me,"Very, very glad I didn't pre-order.  Knowing that Steam is required to run this is a huge stop sign for me.  There are so many problems with Steam that a short blurb here could not do it justice.  Hard to believe that a great franchise like Civ could make such a huge blunder.  I've bought most of the other Civs and would have gotten this one, even with mediocre reviews, had it not been for the Steam requirement."
5,Excellent controller,"I love this thing. It's just like using an Xbox controller. I had no issues with lag or deadspots. Synced perfectly. Battery life starts out kinda bad, lasted 3 hours the first 2 charges, but after that I played over 4 hours the next day and still had a bar.  If you like having the Xbox layout, this controller is amazing. It is a bit lighter than an Xbox controller but works great and is comfortable to hold."
1,Not worth my 10 bucks,"I too purchased this game at Costco and we played through all the games.  I thought it a waste of money.  My kids, 6,4 and 2 did not ""get"" the game ... and after trying out each game, never picked it up again.  I actually spent the time to look up the game on Amazon to review it so that you wouldn't waste you money too!!"
5,Worth it,The product is very good and it is 100 percent worth the price. One of the problems I found was the joycon covers we're pretty difficult to put on without scratching it.
5,Works Great and is Very Cheap,"I bought this hard drive for my xbox 4gb slim instead of the official Microsoft one. When i received it, it had no fancy packaging or instructions. The product showed up within three days and when I put it into my xbox, it worked just like the actual Microsoft one. It seems that the extra twenty dollars for the Microsoft hard drive are paying for the packaging. Overall: great product, cheap, works well."
1,Fan did not even last a few weeks started making a terrible noise cheap junk,Junk did not last a few weeks
1,The worst product I've purchased.,"I opened these to and immediately felt skeptical because they were so poorly made. I tried plugging them into the switch and they don't even line up properly. I tried plugging them into our charger, and then our charger stopped working on the one port where I connected one. I tried playing a game and the keys sporadically work with instant drift. I cannot express how utterly crappy these controllers are. I got a refund, but honestly I feel like that wasn't even enough."
5,Worked as advertised for what I needed!,"I bought this product for one purpose, to open my old SNES.  The screw driver set worked like a charm.  I had no problem getting out the security screws and getting them back on after my repair was complete.  This was way better than trying the ""melting pen"" trick.  Honestly, if you are going to try to repair a SNES, spend the money on this set and save yourself hours of frustration trying to figure out other hacks to open old gear."
5,Perfect for my NES 3DS XL.,"Just got it in the mail today. 24 game cases is insane. I have the NES 3DS XL and it fits perfectly and even looks like it can fit it perfectly with a rubber skin as well. room for my stylus's and home charger, probably even for a small car charger as well. I love this thing. I don't even own 24 3DS games yet but this thing will last me a very very long time I can already tell."
5,Just what I needed,Was just what I needed to get an older gaming system up and running.  Was glad to be able to still get one and it was just as good as the original.  Quick and easy to deal with quick delivery.
1,Cheap knock off but its not,"After playing farming simulator for nintendo switch,  I was looking forward to this game being released.  Turns out its just the phone version of the game playable on the switch.  It does not have near the same level of game play as the original switch game does.  Not worth the money."
5,... for my boyfriend and he said it was the best headphones he has ever had,"I bought it for my boyfriend and he said it was the best headphones he has ever had. He's very good at ignoring me now, so they must be decently soundproof. They are very good and not as expensive as many others."
1,Boring as hell.,"Boring. Its a game that incentives you not to play it. Get a good weapon, it breaks, you dont want to use it. Food you make it, want to save it for something else, dont use it. Climbing up a tower like the ladder in a much better game MGS2. Boring boring boring. The lack of music and costumes at the beginning is disappointing. Mario Odyssey definitely deserves GoTY wayyyyyy more."
5,We love it,"Couldn't resist ordering this as a little early treat, and I can tell you we're going to have a lot of fun with it.  It is NOT difficult at all to use but you do have to have some creativity.  If you don't like drawing you probably aren't going to like something called UDRAW! LOL. But my daughter does and she already spent about two hours with this and we are planning to play as a family over Thanksgiving. The first impression we have is that this is great. So far we like it!!"
1,The box with damages I hope not to have problems with the console because of those hits in the box.,The box with damages I hope not to have problems with the console because of those hits in the box. Visually the console is fine. But it is disappointing to pay a greater amount of money for the Nintendo Switch and have it delivered to me like that.
1,very disappointed,"I put the keyboard together.  I was very happy with the way it looked.  When I plugged the keyboard into my laptop and used it, some  of the keys of the keyboard would not type.  Thinking it could be switches, I replaced with switches I knew would work.  The keyboard still did not work properly.  I trouble shooted by opening up the keyboard and discovered some of the soldering was not soldered properly.  There was connectors that just came off.  If the company could make sure its workers solder completely and fully test the keyboards, this could be an excellent product."
1,7.1 Surround is terrible and Interference still occurs,"I have been looking for a wireless headset with 7.1 surround sound like the current headset I have which is the Corsair Void 2017. This ""GSP 670 Premium Wireless"" is a piece of junk compared to that. The 7.1 surround sounds terrible, the program you have to download to tweak it is useless, the ""no interference"" is a lie, this whole headset is a scam. DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK. Waste of time and money, I am returning it the day i received it. My Corsair Void is 10 times better than this piece of crap in terms of sound quality and surround sound quality. Plus, it says no interference, low latency..... a whole lie as well. Please do not buy this, it is absolute trash. Very disappointing."
5,"Great product, comfortable",Soft material up against your face. Adjusts easily and holds well with the single clip. Switch fits perfectly.
1,PRICE GOUGING AND FALSE  DESCRIPTION,"The picture is a lie , the console and game are separated and I probably could have bought them separated for less . Price gouging, false description."
5,Amazing quality,"Finally a joy con charging dock worth buying! I have had two PowerA docks have a charging port fail on me in the last 6 months and they will not even respond to my support email requests. Saw an instagram post for this dock and instantly came to amazon to buy it. This has amazing build quality and is beautifully constructed. Extremely happy with my purchase, plus HyperX has great customer support if anything goes bad I am not worried."
1,online requirement sucks!,i got this game a week ago thinking that id be able to download it and play. not so. you need a internet connection to download the stupid thing and i do not live in a place where internet is easily accesible. would of been a good game. wasted 60 dollars on it though.
4,great game if you haven't upgraded past Win 98,I recently got a new computer with Windows XP and the game insists it needs Windows 95 (mind you it ran fine on Windows 98).  So please be aware that the computer company needs to make an updated version that supports Windows XP.
5,Fantastic headset especially for the money,This headset has great sound quality and is extremely light. The microphone is not bad at all especially when you adjust it in the game settings but it will pick up background noise. You cannot beat this headset for the price!
1,Wrong items sent,"The system came with a power adapter for a PS2.  We are unable to turn the system on without purchasing an additional cord for an additional fee.  At this time I do not know of the system actually works, and I am too late to return the item"
1,One Star,"Very poor finish of the item , one of them came with spots that I could not remove."
1,Unfinished game...,"As someone who loves Battlefield and has been playing since 1942 I can say this years release has been a total letdown. Even when you try and enjoy the game you're constantly coming across scenarios that simply make the game unplayable such as enemies not loading, being unable to re spawn, being unable to aim vertically, weapons switching randomly, etc.. With this amount of bugs, broken weapon balancing, lack of VoIP, terrible UI and progression system issues; this game should have definitely been delayed.."
1,More of the same.,Save your money for battlefront 2. This game is just half a normal game waiting to lure you in and make you pay for several small dlcs. In all reality the core fame should have been ftp.
4,Great game for civ fans,"Great switch port, works very smoothly and definitely a recommendation for civ fans that want to play civ on the go. Only thing about the game is no online mutiplayer and a few features from rise and fall dlc are not implemented  (like loyalty and governor systems)"
4,It's great but very short!,The game is great and the graphics are awesome but the game is very short. You can finish it in 3 to 4 days including getting all the trophies. The story line if you were able to skip the scenes you probably finish it in 1.5 hours.
1,"half featured game, lazy port, but full price!","I can't believe telltales games is releasing the game like this on the vita, I've been waiting for this game to come out and then I learn that it's only a 3ds port! Still they ask 40 bucks out of this, no less, even on the PS store. The hardware is way more than capable for handling this kind of game, anyone that has seen uncharted or wipeout knows it, there's even already an open world game like gravity rush that works beautifully, however they instead remove the defining feature of this game, the open world. Without that it's just the same lego game we've already played a million times, no thanks."
5,Five Stars,For reals it's the 26 and still not out it said kate July this is late.
5,Yay!,Perfect headset for my son. Got tired of him shouting across the room so these were much needed!
5,Useful Hardware,"This larger MU is key for storing your profile and keeping difficult-to-replace game saves.  Since the 360 dies quite often and needs to be replaced (by a very good warranty), this device removes the need to replace, for a example, an entire Forza2 garage."
5,Excellent Time Travel Series,"Have been waiting for this to come out as a complete series box set for some time. Contacted seller to be sure dvds would play in U.S.A. When arrived I was worried when I saw region code on box, but all the disc worked and played fine. If you like time travel adventures this one is great because they go to specific events like the hindenburg disaster and when Lincoln was shot and try to change the outcome and alter time. Great series that ended way to soon."
5,very good game with a steep learning curve,It took a long time but I finally was able to enjoy playing this game.  Steep learning curve!  Highly recommended and very challenging game.
1,Not with the DRM!!!,"I was greatly looking forward to this game, but with the DRM  - no thank you. EA drop the DRM and I'm a customer in a New York minute."
5,I have played this for hours and loved it. The online is fixed and single player ...,I have played this for hours and loved it. The online is fixed and single player is what I remember playing when they originally released.
1,All Glitz No Glamour!,"Don't get me wrong I love Final Fantasy but FFX is poo! First you might be expecting a 4 disc set like previous versions but this one is a one disk game.  This means less space for a variety of music (The battle song gets real old real fast) and less space for graphics (All the good graphics are the same as they show you on the commercial, nothing new) after you see all the good graphics Square really skimps on the characters details.  They turn into 16 bit graphics before your half way through the game.  Final Fantasy had a good reputation with previous versions but this one is just riding the comp wave.  The next one will have to be better because this one stinks!"
5,Well worth the money!,"Owned this on PS3, and my cable to the guitar had some problem where I got very bad feedback, so I quit playing.  When The PS4 version came on sale for the holidays for the same price as a new cable, I had to buy.  It's a lot of fun.  It teaches you so much about how a guitar is played, and different techniques.  Is it the perfect teacher? No.  But you can learn so much, and at your own pace, on your own time.  I cannot afford to pay someone to sit there and explain all of this stuff to me like this software can.  Once I get better I will incorporate real lessons into my practice, but this is such a huge help for anyone who wants to get started in guitar.  I had no musical experience prior to buying this, but I am loving it.  I recommend strating with rythym guitar first.  I started lead guitar before, and it was much harder to understand guitar starting from zero knowledge."
1,Product not as Advertised,"Product is used seller states all their products are new, this is proof that isn't so ( see pictures). stick and throttle show lots of use, Coating on grips worn down to plastic from lots of use more then 1 year of use. Was missing parts should have 2 sets of suction cups, however it only had 1 set of 4 which have saliva on them all dried up. Not as advertised. Should say used in the description, but nowhere to be found. False advertisement. Sent it back immediately for a refund!"
1,Blank disk placed instead of ps4 disk,"Appears that somebody purposely replaced the correct disk with another one.  My son was highly disappointed, when he opened it today.  Today is his birthday. I am also very disappointed."
5,Inexpensive update to an older system we still love.,"Allows slightly higher resolution (480Progressive) and game imaging on newer displays.  Even if your TV supports the RCA connections, this will give it a slight boost.  Good value for the money.  Don't forget you have to change the display parameters in your Wii settings to get the difference.  If you just plug it in, you will get the video, but at the same interlaced resolution."
5,Great product!,We love this product!  We have it plugged into the wall with an AC adapter (you can get one here on Amazon) and it not only charges our remotes but also keeps track of them.  If I had a nickel for each time we've asked one another where a controller or remote is with a 3 year old around...
5,"Just a heads up, if your buying this game ...","Just a heads up, if your buying this game for the battle royale mode, it's free just download it.  also the entire game will be free sometime next year.  when you buy this game you're essentially paying to play an early access beta of a free to play game before the complete free game is released."
1,I'm appalled,I really hope people stop paying this absurd price for this trap. And I'm appalled at the retailers and people who are selling at this price. This is a child's game...young children play...parents are already raped with this game with all the different characters they have to buy...now traps. ...and also the elusive kaos....This will be my family's last installment of Skylanders. ..never again. Good job Activision...for pissing off so many loyal customers
5,Works Great!  Good Value.,"Pretty self explanatory.  Transfers signal without any problems, reasonably priced.  A good replacement for your proprietary Playstation cord."
1,lol 290 dollar's,lol who in there right mind would pay that lol get a life lol
5,Awesome headset,"These are very well made and sound almost perfect. I had a set of razors and these are by far better. Super comfy and the inline volume control switch is nice, although I dont know what the V control is for."
5,Don't listen to the negative online reviews,"If you are a fan of the borderlands franchises this is definitely the game for you,  its alot smoother than the others and more features."
1,"3, 4,and 5 were better","It's less inventive, and leaves behind the rpg element of improving your character with skills earned through XP. It also makes it more linear than the games before it."
5,Best way to go wireless!,This thing does a great job. Controller is always ready to go when i am ready to play. As a bonus it keeps me from wearing out the USB charging port on the controller. The base is very sturdy and holds the controller well. No cons for me on this item.
2,"Has some nice ideas, but implementation fails miserably.",This game simply needed to be beta tested longer. It was released in an unfinished state. The AI is particularly broken. I'll consider playing the game again after several patches and improvements have been made.
5,Daisy Is Back!!!,Gorgeous amiibo. Super detailed and colorful. One of my favorites out of all of the figures I own. Definitely recommend!
4,Niceeee,Fits well. Enjoyed the nice little color switch to gold. Gives the controller a more custom feel
5,Excellent addition to the Mario and Luigi series,"I've missed a few along the way, but I'm a big fan of the Mario and Luigi games.  This one does not disappoint.  The main action of the game takes place in Luigi's dreams (where he is an amazing hero and able to do special things).  Like previous games, the bros work together to do timed moves against enemies.  There are also special Luigi moves that involve mini games like rolling up Luigis, to give the moves more power.  There are also Luigi star constellations that you can use to make a hoard of Luigis, which you stack up to reach higher places.  One other game feature I really enjoy is pulling on Luigi's mustache to launch Mario around the level.  As the game just came out yesterday, I can't say how I found the ending, but I am really enjoying the game."
5,full-size rules,"Unlike a lot of illuminated keyboards, this bad boy is the full-sized and standard layout. Illumination comes around each key and through each letter, rather than through the key itself, which makes it much easier to use in the dark."
5,Five Stars,Love this game
4,Challenging for a 6 year old,I bought this for my kindergartener. Now that we have figured it out (I found the onscreen guide easier to understand than the booklet that comes with the game)he really likes it. He does need an adult nearby to read  things such as pop-up hints to him. He also was scared by the eerie sound  effects but they can be turned off. He is still at the easy level and I  limited him to just one character to play. The game is pretty slow on our  aging Pentium 166 and it takes a while to move from place to place in the  park.
5,Great Headpgones For Cell Phone Use,"I bought these to use on my cell phone for maximum background reduction of sound, speaker acuity, and voice recognition. These headphones do all three very well. The microphone sounds like it has a little echo. I might be able to control this on my computer. I use these to  make sales calls. Greatest drawback is the weight, they are a little heavy and I can't wear them all day."
1,Can't play with my kids without buying more switches is a deal breaker.,"Bought this to play with my son. Requires another switch. That's nuts, why no splitscreen multi-player? This is the switch, the king of local multi-player consoles! It's enough of a deal breaker where we just don't really play this game now."
1,Stupid Nintendo not supplying enough stock to legit customers who ...,One per customer is what we need. Stupid Nintendo not supplying enough stock to legit customers who have been waiting for this for a while. Now all we have is scalped copies. You suck Nintendo!
1,price gouging,do not buy this
5,Worth every penny!,"Product came as described (and early!), ready to use.  There seemed to be some lag in the controller (I only got the SNES controller) for the first few games, after that, it functions smoothly. My inner 10 year old is excited for endless gaming this winter."
4,Storage less than 1Tb,"I figured out that the available storage is only 780.9 G, way less than 1 Tb, is this common? Do the system files really occupy more than 200G disk space?"
5,Great value,Great product for a great price!
5,This is a great charger!,"This is, as-advertised, an official Nintendo branded Switch charger. It works as expected. I wanted to write this review because a lot of sellers on Amazon will advertise a product as if it's the official Nintendo version, and then send you a generic, third-party version instead. Rest assured, this is the actual Nintendo branded charger."
5,Feels like a classic RPG,Currently a few hours into the game and loving every minute of it. This feels like a classic RPG that I used to play on the PS1 while going above and beyond with some new and challenging game mechanics. Even though the game is sprite based it shows off what the Unreal 4 engine is capable of through the lighting and particles. If you are ready for nostalgia with a real challenge I highly recommend this game.
5,"Yes, yes, yes!","I recently found my old Game Boy Advance SP and Pokemon Emerald. Unfortunately, the battery died out. I purchased this one in hopes of reviving my childhood and it did! The battery came with a screwdriver which was a bonus because I didn't expect it. Once I plugged that sucker in, my Game Boy came to life!"
1,One Star,Missing game cartridge.
1,This is total crap don't believe the 5 star fabricated,This is total  crap don't believe the 5  star fabricated reviews
1,Ridge Racer Vita,Is this a demo??? I don't know what they were thinking.  Where is the rest of the game??  Don't buy this game.
1,flimsy,"it fits controller well problem the latch on bottom to hold it to controller is extremely flimsy and small. If you so much as burp, fart or fidget your phone is falling off your controller. Its bad engineering and the latch should of been longer. I your thinking of laying in bed with this look for another brand"
1,Don't but,It didn't work right out of the box. It has to go to PlayStation to see if they can fix it. It will probably be a month or more before we know if they'll replace it or fix it. I wish I had never bought it. My son is super upset.
1,Not worth the wait,"Game is not worth the wait.  Typical animal crossing, and having to wait almost a week past release date is ridiculous."
2,Does not include all DLC,"Fun game, only wish it came with the DLC. Costs another 50 bucks to get the full game, so keep that in mind."
5,Daughter loves it!,This has a very old school feel with the buttons and clicking. It is heavy and feels high quality. The lights are awesome and make me very jealous of my kiddo.
1,Tired of Playstation's BS,"long time Playstation defender, ordered the launch edition in June. Recieved it on the 15th. Blue blinking light of death, never connected to HDMI.  WIll not be buying PS4.  Xbox has my business moving forward"
5,Scared from reviews at first but now very satisfied after receiving product,"I have been wanting to get this device solely for my pokemon 3DS games as I am trying to create a living dex for HOME and wish to transfer shiny pokemons that can gigantimax in Sword and Shield, which aren't that many- but regardless I did not want to invest a lot time in shiny hunting or capturing every pokemon I need as I'm currently pursuing two degrees at the same time in college and thus found powersaves to be the quickest method possible for this (I got too lazy to use homebrew and didn't like how it relied on such long and complex tutorials). But once I saw the reviews for this device I started getting worried about losing the unique license key as quite a few have reported with damaged shipments. Some have even left reviews on the code not working and so I doubted this product for a while but then said whatever and bought it two days ago. Arrived yesterday and everything worked perfectly despite the many terrible reviews this product may have. Just wanted to leave this review as both a thanks and sign of hope that the product may arrive in pristine working condition for you as well."
5,Good cheap charger,Bought Black Friday deal. Was cheep and even though it barely gets used. I almost like it better then the energizer brand one I use daily. The controllers sit nice and snug while charging and has a nice low profile. The only downside it charges by usb and I would like to not have extra power drain going through my Xbox. Otherwise I would swap it out for the energizer one which charges with a normal outlet plug.
1,DOA Unit - sounds like I'm not the only one!,"Another DOA unit.  Boots up long enough to get started then shuts down.  Really, really disappointed!  I took off work early to get home after getting the UPS notification that it was delivered - should have stayed at work...."
5,Great,Good so far fast shipping good for gamers
1,WRONG REGION,UK version downloadable characters unavailable via provided code. Not mentioned im description.
1,the game is gross bandicoots is vermin,ain't it disgustin it just ripsoff Sarnic a Hejhog and aslo r ain't it disgustin it just ripsoff a Yoda fron the prequels.  Rupsoff Yoda in prequels because because Yoda is always flips around and do spins and summer salts in the game and bandicoot does sane thing.  ALSO ripsoff off Donkey Krong bcause just look at side graphics phics just like Diddy Kong.  AND alsi teh game.  Bandicoot is just pest in Austria and dad sade they perleememomorph and just pets in real life.  Why a pest being hero that's just gross.  The game is gross and aint it disusting.  I hade some shrimp and real spicy broth this dinner it was god.  But I didnt want to play gross game but dad and sis hoggin the PS4 so I throwing popcorn at mom while she tries to watch a the movies on cowch.  Alsop can here gane in other roo; and it loud and the sounds is bad.  Ok gotta go but thaks for reviewq
5,Surprisingly Good!,"To be completely transparent, I do not own the game, but played my friends version for quite some time.  He is a serious tennis fan and is very skeptical of these games (he loves it). Usually tennis games are very floaty and or robotic, they get very repetitive and I usually tune out.  There is a lot of motion animations for the players.  A TON of options to design your own character.  The only annoying thing is before you can do anything, you have to create an avatar.  There is no jump in and play option.  I really enjoyed playing this game, I couldn't wait for the Switch to come out with a real tennis game.  I bought Mario Tennis, which is good, but it has so many ""Arcadey"" options with lots of over the top graphics and ""power trick shots"".  If you want a realistic tennis experience on the Switch, then this is the game to get.  The crowd reactions are great too.  Really happy with it."
5,Fast and works wonderfully for my emulators,"Delivery was fast and the controller works wonderfully for my emulators. It does all systems perfect. It's the only controller that can meet all retro system controller needs. Two analog sticks (this IS in fact analog, some controllers are six point), six buttons and four bumpers. Covers the N64, PS1,SNES, NES Genesis etc. I love it"
1,Scam,Costs just as much as a whole new headset. Scam
4,A Nice Surprise,"I was surprised by this game. When I bought it, I was desperate for a new adventure game so I decided to give this one a try. I lucked out. This game was actually clever and interesting and had several different endings depending on certain choices you make near the latter part of the game (If you buy it, make several distinct saves during the last quarter of the game.). The main activities in the game are exploring DaVinci's villa and making his devices work in order to progress through the game. Don't be put off though, the puzzles aren't too difficult and most of the time you know what you should be doing. This game has a sound storyline and the puzzles fit nicely into the story. There are no mazes or slider puzzles and you don't have to incinerate any zombies."
4,Surprisingly great,"Who says that the PS2's dwindling release of titles aren't any good these days?  Grim Grimoire marks yet another surprisingly great, late in life game for the PS2 that is definitely worth picking up.  Combining real time strategy and small RPG elements that make for a unique and fun gaming experience, Grim Grimoire is a blast.  You take on missions via maps and unlock pages from the Grimoire (spell books).  It sounds complicated, and it is to a point, but once you get the hang of it, Grim Grimoire offers plenty of deep and rewarding gameplay that RTS buffs will not only appreciate, but greatly enjoy as well.  The game looks as great as a mostly 2-D rendered game can look, and the colorful characters and quirky moments are more than enough for one to enjoy too.  The few flaws of Grim Grimoire is that the story isn't as clever, or nearly as original, as it thinks it is; and many of the maps look too similar to one another, but these are minor gripes at best.  The biggest problem with Grim Grimoire is that if you're not into real time strategies, you'll encounter a few problems getting into the game and it's intricate design, but newcomers can get the hang of it in time.  That being said, Grim Grimoire is a surprisingly great game that re-affirms the fact that the PS2 is far from dead."
5,Works great with my IPhone 6!!,"I got this control for my iPhone 6 to play GTA SA, it paired with without a problem. Feels the same size as the Xbox controller."
5,Good game,Old classic done a new way. Great game overall. Very fun and after all these years still looks good as far as graphics and gameplay is smooth and easy
5,well thought out controls for the first PSP FPS,"i had my doubts about how the developers were going to setup the controls with only one jowstick, but they managed to do it just fine. it almost makes me with that fireteam bravo does the same thing. you get used to it pretty fast. with the awesome graphics and wide selection of weapons, this is a great game."
5,Solid Entry Level Sim Rig,"After many weeks of combing the internet and researching different sim chassis I settled on this one. It was very well packaged and protected, the instructions are above average, and the build quality is excellent for this price point. Assembly took about two hours (not including adjustments) and I was up and racing shortly after. No noticeable flex or noises using the Thrustmaster TX and TM Pro Pedals and everything was predrilled for my set up."
5,Op,"Gonna keep it short and simple, if you're getting this for rainbow six, using them feels like a hack. They are absurdly over power and making aiming and recoil control ridiculously easy."
1,Crap dont waste your money,This is a third party memory card. It was blocked by my Ps2 after i had saved a few games on it. Rpg games i had already spent a few days on each. Needless to say I wasn't happy. Don't wast your money. Buy a real Sony Made card dont be fooled by the promise of extra memory because you wont be able to use it any way. if i could have picked a no star rating i would have.
1,Outrageous,Even my dogs offended
1,Uses a slow emulation layer,This game runs horrible on Mac due to the Transgaming emulation layer. Dragon Age II is not a native Mac app. This is the Windows version running on top of special emulation software. It absolutely kills the performance. Unless you have an incredibly high-end Mac the performance will be terrible.
1,I bought this game for the online features like Matchmaking and to try the Halo 5 Beta,"I bought this game for the online features like Matchmaking and to try the Halo 5 Beta. It's launch day and it looks like no one can access any of it. Great job MS and 343 for screwing this launch up. One of the most anticipated releases of the year and you guys manage to make people regret pre-ordering. What a joke. If I knew day one would go down like this, I wouldn't have rushed to pre-ordered my copy when it was first available."
5,Greatness,Fallout 4 is as great as you'd expect it to be times 10. The story is masterfully written and the graphics are beautiful. There are a few bugs but they're only as annoying as a fly. This game is beyond worth buying. Be prepared to say goodbye to your old life and begin an adventure in the Boston Wasteland.
5,Best game ever made,"Halo is one of the best games on the xbox 360, if you get this game then you wouldn't be disapointed for getting this game. As a bonus you will get some map packs and some avatar items such as master chiefs avatar cloak which might appear on your avatar inventory. However if you don't have enough money I recommend getting the Halo 4 standard edition for a better price, also it will be 4.0 GB to install Halo 4 on your Xbox 360 so if you don't have enough memory like the 4GB xbox 360, I suggest you get a USB flash drive with either 8gb or 16gb. Amazon has great deals for USB flash drives, if you have a 250 GB xbox 360 then you are good enough to install halo 4 on it. Master Chief again returns to to save the world again from the enemys attacking the world, enemys might be difficult again like Halo 3. (Also i'm not really good at writing reviews so I did my best to write this review.)"
1,"Great game, not so great shipping","Nice special edition. Very cool, and the game is great. However my order arrived with damage to both the plastic and box itself. Not cool."
4,Light up keyboard,A cool keyboard. Love it.
1,Huge disappointment,"I'm not going to be long winded.  I have been a Civ fan as long as there has been a Civ.  I have owned and played all of them.  Civ 5 is a huge disappointment.  Basically imagine Civ 4 stripped down as if they were trying to make it compatible for console gaming.  Then they stripped it down further to make it appeal to the Halo frat boy crowd.  Now you have Civ 5.  Just keep playing 4, people."
1,Does not deserve a star. Did not work at ...,Does not deserve a star. Did not work at all! Tried to return and get a refund but seller gave me the run around. Save your money and don't purchase.
1,Broken item,This item was a gift that was opened yesterday and came like this. Broken.
5,Working As Intended,"There is nothing wrong with the season pass, regardless of what several people have said. There was no DLC at that time to download, so, duh, they couldn't download anything. As far as I am aware, the first DLC coming is Dec 29 (2015), and it is a new Endurance Mode. Then I think in January (2016) or early in 2016, there is a new mission, the trailer was just released recently, and it looks really interesting. So NOW is the time to get your season pass if you haven't yet and are interested in more RotTR."
5,Works as intended. Ended up not needing it after ...,"Works as intended. Ended up not needing it after figuring out that my Steam Link has a receiver built-in. Oh well, the price I pay for stupidity."
5,Best money spent,How do you keep your teenager away from your long changer. Buy him this charger for his oclus now he has no reason to to take my 6 foot charger
5,Very impressive wireless mouse,"Awesome mouse! But the battery don't last 36 hours, more like a solid 21 hours of battery life. Great mouse either way. Unique design, super light with out the charger attached. Great response time, no lag, and totally customizable. I am very happy with it so far. Even though the price is above my average spending limit for a wireless mouse."
1,Oh the horror,"This game is terrible. The controls are like wrestling with an alligator, the graphics look like something on the PS1, the story is beyond laughable, and the sound will blow out your speakers (and not in a good way). I wouldn't wish this game on my worst enemy. I just wish I could give it 0 stars. The best thing you can say for this game is that the disc might make a good frisbee. The cover art is the best part of the experience."
2,"Great Sound, poor structure and life span","Wonderful headset, while it lasts. Great sound and mic. However Like many have posted, after about a year of normal use(I have not dropped or damaged these in any way) the point where the headphones meet the head band stresses and then breaks.  photos included."
1,Disapointed,"Years ago I had a Hoyle bridge game that was well done.  This edition offers no real challenges, does not have a feature that allows you to claim all tricks, does not have a feature that automatically plays a card if it is the only card in that suit that could be played; all in all, it is a cumbersome product.  I have a free version that is much more challenging.  I am most disappointed with this product."
4,Wireless Gaming Mouse,"This was given as a Christmas gift, seems to be working ok, no issues so far.  The price wasn't bad and shipping didn't take too long."
1,adware,was going to buy it until i heard it was linked with adware. a game with adware should be much cheaper or FREE!!
5,Works as expected for a good price,"I was a little tentative when I got this, but the price was right. Basically, wanted to use it to hook my Wii up to a wired network. Plugged it in and it worked. Good price, and for once no configuration mess or any problems. If you're wavering on this or the official twice-the-price connector, I'd highly recommend this."
1,Very disappointed.,"I've been looking for storage for our Infinity characters and thought this would be perfect. We've got quite a few, so I grabbed two. First off, the MSRP is way too high for what you get. It's just cheap plastic. My biggest issue though is that, if you choose not to use the Infinity base as the top, there's no other piece and you're left with a storage unit that looks like pieces are missing. The only alternative for me is to stack four of them, but then I either have to put it on the floor where it will get knocked over and no one can see what's in the bottom area or else it's stacked so high the kids can't reach the Infinity base to play. How hard would it be to include a simple piece of plastic to fill this slot?  I've got two that are going back."
1,An unfinished game,I bought this game yesterday and wish i hadn't. The game is a total unfinished product. A rip off. Barely no story mode. No arcade mode. The shop isn't open yet so you can't buy new characters or costumes. The online mode doesn't work properly. The game seems more like its still in Beta than an actual complete game. People work hard for their money and then they have to be subjugated to this pile of garbage. An unfinished game.
5,Great product!,"Bought this as a gift for my boyfriend, who's a gamer. He loves it, and there have been no problems with it! He was especially pleased that the ear pieces were extremely comfortable to wear and didn't make his ears sore when he used them for long periods of time. The mic works great and the sound quality it picks up is sharp and clean."
5,An obession in a box,"World of Warcraft is designed to be playable by the once a week player or the die hard gamer. However, once you've hit those first levels, once you beat your first boss, I don't know how once a week will be enough! There is simply so much to explore and do, that getting to the limit cap will seem like a whirlwind. Don't be afraid to try everything, mix it up, classes, races, professions, they all benefit you and they all make it fun. Good Hunting!"
1,Don't waste your time,"I've been a long time fan of Final Fantasy and I was utterly disappointed by this installment of the franchise.  Beneath a glossy package of superb graphics and good voice acting is a very linear, tedious game.  The story is mediocre and it's often lost by the grinding you're inevitably going to have to do in this game.  It's certainly not an easy game to master.  I was also extremely disappointed by the score for the game.  The music is not up to par with previous installments of the franchise and is instead too pop.  While this game shows promise in a few places, the cons are far too rotten for me to say this was a mediocre game.  It was a waste of my money and I don't recommend it to anyone."
5,"... for the nintendo switch and this one is the best, it has air vents where the fans are ...","Tried a few of stands for the nintendo switch and this one is the best, it has air vents where the fans are and its tall enough for the USB C cable to plug into."
2,... was so excited to get to sign up andwatch season 10 on UP,I was so excited to get to sign up and watch season 10 on UP! But VERY disappointed to find out I could only get 3 episodes! I read other reviews and have to agree - it is misleading and false advertising!
1,Awful game. NOT THE SAME as the PS3 or Xbox.,"What a disappointment. Watching the game trailer on Amazon led me to believe that the graphics were going to be great, realistic and fluid. What you get with the Wii is a clunky, jerky, watered down, hard to maneuver headache. Plus there are more cut scenes than I have ever seen and they just seem to randomly pop up interfering with game play. I would seriously not recommend this game to anyone."
4,Almost perfectly captures the feel of the comic,"While not perfect by any means, this GBA adaption of the The Incredible Hulk sucessfully captures the feel of the comic, and is better than it's home console bretheren.  Played on an isometric point of view, you control The Hulk through 33 huge levels while walloping on the military and an array of tanks, missles, and other baddies.  As you progress, you gain new abilities and attack combinations; meaning that you must play through the game aggressively to succeed.  Also, many puzzle elements are involved, and while some are typical (a la flip to switch to keep going), it adds a more intelligent depth to the game instead of just bashing everything in sight.  Boss battles are difficult as well, requiring you to strategize your attacks; all of this makes The Hulk much better than expected.  Although the fighting elements can wear thin, there is still a bit of replay value to be had here with link cable abilities that add to the fun.  The graphics are nicely rendered (and are almost reminiscent of the Hulk game released for 16 bit systems years ago), but don't push the system to it's limits.  All in all, The Hulk is one of the better comic licensed games to be released for the GBA, which, along with the earlier released Iron Man, is better than Daredevil and X-Men: Reign of Apocalypse.  Also recommended is Activision's Spider-Man games for the GBA which are nothing short of great."
5,No More Headaches!,"I purchased the Oculus Elite head strap by Meta and it was okay for about 15-20 minutes but I noticed I would get a terrible headache.  I searched for a new headset to try to solve this problem and found it in this Kiwi!  It was super easy to install and even more comfortable on my head than I had hoped.  My headaches are gone and I'm able to play for much longer periods of time!  It is a bit bulky in the back so if you are sitting to play, don't expect to be able to rest your head on the back of your chair comfortably! That is just due to the extra padding and support in the back though so it's worth the sacrifice!  I've also noticed that my neck doesn't hurt near as much from the weight of the Oculus itself.  I feel like it's distributed more evenly now.  I'm so happy I bought this and intend on getting one for my husband as well."
1,A boring walk in the country,"Several hours in and I'm still waiting for something to happen that isn't in a cutscene. Basically, BORING. If anything ever happens, I'll add a star, but I'm not holding my breath until then. If you have been looking for a game that is just walking from place to place, then you're in luck."
5,Great Sturdy Product,"My 12 year old son LOVES this mouse. It actually came a day earlier than predicted, which made bim ecstatic! Thank You!"
5,Works great,Very good.
5,Si te gustan los juegos de guerra acción tácticos. Esta buenísimo.,Se ve increíble y se juega aún mejor. Imprescindible en mi colección de Switch. Por favor apoyen a Rebellion quien es un Third Party de Nintendo y encargado de llevar este maravilloso port a Switch.
5,Great value for the price! Gorgeous arcade cabinet and a must for any Pac-Man lover.,"I purchased this for my finance's birthday and she loves it! The instructions were clear and easy to follow. The DIY portion reminds me of putting together IKEA furniture, nonetheless, the quality and gameplay experience was definitely worth it. We live in a 600ft apartment and the cabinet fits perfectly in the corner of our room without taking too much space. We haven't ran to any issues with the system yet. If you're looking for a classic arcade that doesn't take too much space, affordable, and has the look and feel - this is the machine for you."
5,It is pretty cool.,My son just received this so we cannot speak to the battery life.  My son LOVES FORTNITE. He cut grass and saved is money to buy this himself.  He loves it and uses it with Xbox one.
5,Phenominal game within a game within a game.,"Joy ride to Vegas and play one of five casino games, Slots, Blackjack, Roulette, Poker and Craps. That is the tip of the iceberg though. When you are earning money from these games, random yahoos come up to you asking you for advice, wanting you to invest, on a date, or just trying to mug you. That adds to the gambling! Very nice game, gamble til you go broke pretty much."
5,Glad I chose this product,"I went through so much trying to find a headset to work from home. I  finally settled on this. The sound quality is amazing and the mic is great as well. The caller can hear me loud and clear. The earphones do not feel like it's squeezing my head together even though they are not adjustable. I'm so glad that Amazon came through because Walmart did not. After I've used it a month, I'll update this review."
4,much better than expected,"I got this game earlier in the week and have been pleasantly surprised.  I have about every WII exercise game and this one gives a good workout.  My only complaint is between sequences you get to see Mel B laughing over and over again.  It gets old really quick.  The exercises though have a good variety, you can select which area of the body to tone, work out, etc.  I agree with a previous reviewer that the recipes are not much use unless you want to write them down and then go to the kitchen to make them.  Overall, it gives a good workout."
5,Just what you need,Very duable
4,4 stars,"I have been using this product for a few days now and overall it is a great controller. The button response time is quick, the joysticks have a nice textured grip to keep my movements precise, and overall it feels very ergonomic. It did take me a little bit to get used to how small it is but once I did it was very comfortable for long gaming periods. I would recommend this controller to anyone looking for a wireless game pad. It even has a turbo mode which is fun to mess around with."
5,BUY THE RIGHT ONES!,"It's a great product, I messed up and got these instead of the Xbox 1 headset, but they still work great for PC, and work ok with the Xbox and PS4 as well. The only huge issue with using them on the gaming consoles is that they turn off every once in a while on their own and don't wireless sync to the consoles, but still work nonetheless. Just know that for them to be amazing you have to buy the ones made for the consoles..."
2,Two Stars,shipped like crap.  i have pics. little bits of the broken corner were floating around
1,Do not buy,Probably worst Starwars game ever. Boring and OVERPRICED a lot
5,"Cool, slow, game; exploration, not fighting...","I'm a very casual gamer; but after dying fairly quickly into the game because of environmental reasons, I figured out that I needed to gather elements, assemble stuff, and fix other stuff. It's a slow game, but I'm enjoying the exploration and trying to interact with the critters I stumble upon. Luckily, nothing has tried to eat me yet. It is a truly beautiful game and the controls are quickly learned after moving through the documentation screens. BTW, I didn't read anything about gameplay before installing and then firing it up."
5,You'll need this,The Xbox 360 charger only comes with 1 battery.  If you play alot you're going to need an extra.  There's nothing worse than being in the middle of a great game and your juice runs out.  Get this extra battery!!
4,Inexpensive Option to the Sony Branded Version,"Works just as it should, it's an inexpensive option to the Sony branded items. The one quip I have is that the charger is slightly difficult to fit into the vita charging port. You have to force it all the way in there, which might make one feel uncomfortable(it's a really tight fit). You can switch the wire with a Sony official wire if you are uncomfortable and it still works fine with this adapter. The adapter itself is really light, almost feels like there's nothing in it. My Sony wire started to come apart exposing wires , which is why I purchased this. Otherwise it works and is great value for the price. I'm definitely pleased."
1,"Pretty little system, but not real sturdy","I bought my first DS Lite two months ago. Within three weeks, the top right hinge, which houses the metal mechanism that allows the top section to lock into position while open, broke. I took the unit back to Walmart, and they gave me another one no questions asked. I've had this one six weeks. And tonight the top right hinge broke again.In the exact same place. It's too late to take it back to Wally world, and I'm stuck with sending it back to Nintendo for repairs. I've opted to do my own with Crazy Glue, which for the time being (I hope ) holds it together until I can repurchase the old model again. The Lite is a pretty little thing, but I have serious concerns that the top right hinge is an engineering problem. Please keep in mind that I open and shut mine several times a day, but still, I think the hinge structure is just too flimsy."
1,What the heck,Maybe I didn't read it correctly but what happened to everything from FS19?  Way too much money for a stripped down version.  If you're looking for it to be FS19 but a bit more since it's FS20 don't buy it.
5,I love this game - well worth the money.,"Arrived in 2 days, was very easy to assemble (I actually enjoyed the process) and Golden Tee is still golden after all these years.  4 editions of Golden Tee, each has 3 courses to play.  It's pretty much what you remember from the pubs and bars in the 90s.  LLGT!"
5,Excelent!,I live in Guatemala and bought this on Black Friday.  The price was great and the games included are fun.  Getting the PS3 for half the price you can buy it in my country was the best part.
5,Very addictive and fun,"I love this game and it is the best computer game out right now.  Amusement park junkies will love this.  I learned the hard way about how roller coasters work in this game, so here is a tip: if the coaster is going more than 10 mph, then bank the turn.  Doing this allows for a less extreme ride that gets more riders.  Anyway, the whole thing is great.  The scenarios all get more challenging as you go up, but the hardest one of them all in the original pack is Rainbow Valley, because landscaping is not allowed.  The expansion packs have a lot of good stuff in them, too, but you should start working on the original game scenarios first to get the hang of the game.  Once you know how to build roller coasters the right way, it is lots of fun to start experimenting with bizarre twists, like sending the track through a loop (which requires careful positioning).  The game altogether (with expansions) has about 25 different kinds of coasters, some varying from a simple straight line, like the Reverse Whoa Belly Roller Coaster design to long, fast, twisted track layouts, like the Steel Twister Roller Coaster.  The gentle rides and thrill rides also rake in profits.  Overall, this is a great game, recommended to gamers of all ages."
5,Perfect,Perfect replacement for Xbox 360. Highly recommended. No problems at all
4,I recommend this for Clone Hero.,Works good for Clone Hero.
5,the best game ever!!,"Star craft brood war is a great game. I have been playing it for about 5 years. In star craft, you choose from the races: protoss, terran, or zerg. You choose your race, and then you start the game. In the game you build your own civilization and create units, then you go kill the other players. All the races have their own advantages and disadvantages against each other, which is one of the things that make this game great. The protoss are more advanced and are powerfull, but they are much more expensive, and they build slower. The terran race consists of humans. They are not as expensive as the protoss, but i find them a little more challenging to play with. Then there is the zerg, my favorite. I like the zerg because they build fast, and they are not so expensive. The main advantage of the zerg against both races, is that if you attack someone and all of your units die, you can very quickly build them back up again, and repeat your attack untill you kill that enemy (but i would always keep a few extra units at your base, just incase you get countered by your victims allies.) In Star craft brood war, there are also new units. The new units for the protoss are the Dark archons, which can do mind controll and a few other tricks, and corsairs, wich attack enemy air units. The new units for terran are the valkarie air frigit, and the medic. the valkarie is great against enemy air untis; it shoots rapid missiles at them. The medic is probably the best new unit. With a medic you can rapidly heal your marines and other ground units, and when you are on the net, you can heal your allies units as well. The zerg also have 2 new units: The devourer and the lurker. The devourer by far has the best air attack, but on the other hand, it cant attack ground units. The lurker is another superior unit, (especially if your enemy doesnt have any detectors.) A luker buries itself, and when enemy units walk by, they are torn apart by the lurkers spikes. Then again, lukers and devourers have a shared disadvantage; they both build slow.  In conclusion, I highly recomend Star craft Brood War."
1,Trash bag,This game pretty broken! Very buggy and it suffer bad from an audio glitch!
1,Production doesn't match cost of product. Be wary,"Controller arrived early and damaged. Chips through the ""custom"" job and what looks like a cigarette burn on the front of the controller. Boy was way too expensive to be sent out like that... Only to be given excuses as to why it is the way it is. Process to get a replacement is longer than what it took to get the first controller sent out. Ridiculous. Production needs work. Maybe not rush the job and blame delivery process."
1,Going left.  Going left.  GOING LEFT.,"These controllers aren't very good.  Both controllers drift left ALMOST CONSTANTLY.  Short of opening them up and messing with them, there doesn't seem like there's anything to do to fix that.  Very annoying, makes them hard to use.  If you need PS3 controllers and want to go cheap like I did, try a different listing."
1,Built to last? Nope.,"NOT QUALITY BUILT. It can't even handle bumper jumper controls, my LB button is already broken after only a few months of light usage. Microsoft will not repair it for free. Just get the Lunar controller, that is still working fine for me."
1,Harry Potter and the Instant Trade-In....,"I was enjoying the game until it became obvious I could not move on until I won the ridiculously spastic and insanely programmed Quidditch match using Ron.  Good luck with that. Thirty seconds of uncontrollable flight simulation to catch blips on the screen. Exactly how is anyone going to catch three balls, from three different directions at one time? I got so frustrated, I performed the only successful spell that worked with this game, a wingardium leviosa via flinging the cartridge across the living room."
5,This is a tough one!,"The second in the series, Magician's Handbook II proves to offer a significant challenge to hidden object lovers.  The objects are tough to find- this is a game that takes some time and some skill.  Hidden object lovers who find other games too easy will likely not be disappointed by this one- those who find other games too difficult will likely want to choose something else.  This game offers amazing artwork, very detailed scenes, lots of gameplay and lots of challenge.  Well worth it."
2,What a FAKE!!!,"I am a total fan of the Sims, after my sister introduced me to the Sims 2, I set off to buy all the expansion packs i could find and have tons and tons of fun with....The Sims 2. When i heard that the Sims 3 was coming out i was stoked, i just had to have it. So the weekend of its release i went and bought it(even though it was 50 bucks and my sister advised me not to). With the game in my hands i excitedly left the store, back to my house, and straight to the computer to install it. Turns out i didn't have enough RAM so the next day i went to go buy some and spent another 40 bucks(for 2 sticks). OK, i finally get it installed only to find that the graphics suck, the game crashes at random points, people disappear, the screen goes fuzzy, and basically the game has tons and tons of glitches!! I was so disappointed that EA would just put out a game that was completely not ready to be played. Heartbroken,i was forced to uninstall it and switch back to good old Sims 2, even though it has a long loading wait, it still is A WHOLE LOT better than the sims 3! Do not buy the Sims 3! Wait until EA owns up to its mistake and fixes all the problems that the game has.Trust me, the game has so many problems that you don't even get to enjoy all the new features because you're too busy trying to restart your computer."
1,Just plain can't get it to run,"I want to say up front that the seller met, actually exceeded my expectations. The disk came in the mail quicker than advertised and was complete and free of any kind of damage. I popped the disk into my Windows 7 machine then the error messages started. I attempted to auto run in just about every compatability mode offered. After a couple of hours, I've given up. I just don't think you should have to be a software engineer to get a disk to run."
1,Very disappointed,Keep getting error message stating system is unable to read card.
5,Perfect,"good quality for a good price, same good quality as the pdp kinect stands that are offered for twice the price, packaging could have been better but product was in good shape, at first i couldn't figure out how to open it without feeling like it was going to break but that was because the stand clicks into place so its more sturdy"
5,Five Stars,Performs perfectly
1,Really disappointed,"I have to say, I was really excited for this game (I worked for Sony when the original came out), and after 2 attempts at the very first boss, I was DONE. After discovering how the Battle System really worked, I just completely lost all interest. SO disappointed. It's hack n slash fighting that involves every button on the remote, and switching back and forth between characters, and CONSTANT pausing of the action to use items or special moves. I considered returning it but my 18 year old son thought it was ""neat"" so I guess I won't. Unfortunately though, as an older guy who doesn't game much anymore, it was overly difficult and the tedious process of the fights completely ruined for me. Not fun. I guess I was expecting an actual remake but better. You'll recognize the characters and that's about it."
1,Dont buy,Terrible story. Depressing and slow. Actions have little impact on how Daniel uses his abilities.
5,Very Entertaining!,"My nine year old daughter loves this game!  She has been asking for it since her older sisters received a similar game for their Nintendo DS systems.  Though it's not as graphic and detailed as the DS game, she is very happy with it and has no problem moving though the game.  She plays it often and is always full of smiles and giggles as she plays!"
1,Basically a Hunting Game,"This game is basically the same thing as Deer Avenger or Big Game Hunter, with the main difference being that you are hunting women.  You can only move left or right as if you were standing in one place and turning 360  degrees.  You then throw out bait to slow down the women, so you can hit  them with goop, which you also throw(shoot) at them.  The goop dissolves  their clothes down to their underwear, and you take a picture.  You have 5  min or so to take 3 pictures before aliens blow up the planet.  The aliens  ran out of victoria secret catalogues or something apparantly.  That is  basically the entire game.  Shoot goop, take picture, etc.  If you like  hunting games, this might be fun for you, if not STAY AWAY."
5,Five Stars,"Very good,"
1,"I order a game from Amazon, but cant play it cause I dont have steam","I hate this.  I have a game I want to play, but cannot.  Steam has ruined it.  I WILL NOT install that program on my system, sorry.  I will not tolerate having to seek permission to play something I just bought from amazon.  Please masters, may I play my own property?  NO.  So, yea, this game may be great, but it cannot even be played without becoming a slave.  I wish I could give it a -50 stars."
5,11 year old son loves this head set!!!,"My son (11) loves this set!! First headset that has lasted longer then 2 days. Feels sturdy, and feels good on my sons ears.  Very happy with this unit!!!"
5,Amazing,"Not a fan of the game, but the PS5 delivered fast, in good condition, and everything was included."
5,Excellent Minecraft Detail,This Xbox bundle is Amazing. The game was included as a digital download code. The system itself is awesome! The detail for the Minecraft design is spot on. Including the Redstone dust on the bottom of the console as if it was truly powered by Redstone dust. The musical Minecraft sounds at start up and shut down are cute. I only bought it because I wanted 1 Tb of memory and you can only get 1 Tb in bundles. Worth every dollar.
1,Bnet worse than in beta,"Between random disconnects, no cross region play, no chat rooms, no clans, no lan, bnet brings the game down from a 5 to a 1.  It is that bad.  What is the point of trying to innovate sc2 as a social scene if I can't even play with my european friends?"
5,Would highly recommend!!!,"I'm in love with the digital only Xbox great value for console the 3 games included and a month worth of  Xbox gold best purchase ever made,would highly recommend."
1,Lite Gamer Portable,"Extremely disappointed which this product. I bought this product in hopes of having excellent game play footage recorded from my Wii U and PC. The description clearly shows Wii U as one of the listed consoles that this product should work with, yet I've yet to record a single second of game play with it. The preview windows are always Black no matter what I'm trying to record, be it PC or Console and both were hooked up correctly. When set up with OBS, the preview window is always Red, and yes the properties were set to LGP Lite Streaming Engine so I know it was correct. I've watched multiple videos trying to get this product to work but with no avail, even reinstalling drivers and the applications multiple times after full uninstallations. Even on Oracle, a virtual machine, it doesn't show up and gives the same problems. I'm a Computer Technology and Automotive Technology major, I'm the go to person when other's have electrical and computer problems. I can only conclude that my device is defective, but this shouldn't be the case if Quality Assurance had actually taken place. The 1 star rating is not only because of the device being inoperable but also because they allowed a defective device to be shipped which is worrisome and disappointing after hearing so much praise for this product. Received today. Returned Tomorrow."
1,"Great mouse, but scroll wheel broke","This is probably one of my favorite performing mice I have owned for gaming.  Movement and feel both are great.  Less than two months after purchasing however, I had an issue with the scroll wheel.  When you do things like scroll down, it will cycle a few screens down and then go up one for some reason.  Researching this appears to be a common issue others have experienced.  Contacted their customer service for a possible RMA and have not had a reply yet."
2,Looks goofy on me and is not comfortable..,"As you can see in the attached image, the elastic band rests on your head while the big plastic piece is like 2.5 inches above my head. It just looks weird to me like I'm wearing headphones that are far too big for my head. Also, the elastic that rests on your head has no grip to it and is very slick so the headset actually slides back OFF my head and I have to keep adjusting it while gaming - not comfortable. The sound and microphone is mediocre at best and a cheaper Turtle Beach Headset sounds 10x better. I am disappointed because these were so expensive and I have head great things about Steel Series. I guess the headset search continues."
5,This adapter will allow you to connect an Xbox One Kinect to an Xbox One X,The adapter was able to successfully connect an Xbox One Kinect to my Xbox One X. It functions as it should and I have not had any issues after weeks of use.
1,won't work,Be careful about this product. It must have the same number as your guitar in order for it to work
5,Very nice screen protector,Easy to install and gets the job done.
2,Won't charge with Energizer Charging Station!!!,"The product comes just as it appears in the picture. I thought I was just buying the battery pack, but the cover for the back of the remote comes attached to the battery. It isn't compatible to charge with the Energizer Charging Station for Wii. The charge plate that needs to rest upon the station to charge isn't located in the same place as the Energizer batteries. Example: When you put Energizer's batteries for Wii remotes in the remote and cover it, the charging piece is located towards the top of the remote back cover and then the remote rests up against the charging station to charge. However, the product that is pictured, the charging plate is located at the bottom of the remote back cover."
5,One of the best games for the Dreamcast!!,"I've been a fan of the Ultimate Fighting Championship since UFC III. Now,  Years later and a short time to go until UFC XXVII, a UFC game finally  comes out!! I've been dreaming of one for years, and now it's actually  here. UFC is without a doubt one of the best games to ever come out on the  Dreamcast system. The game is exciting, fun, fast paced, and the graphics  are phenominal! It's a great game if your tired of the average fighting  games like I am. The game is like a combination of a fighting game, a  sports game like Knockout Kings and a wrestling game like Wrestlemania  2000. The great thing about the game is that you actually have to use some  strategy in fighting. The game has a good amount of actual UFC veterans;  such as, Maurice Smith, Frank Shamrock, Mark Coleman and others. The one  thing I was disappointed on was that it didn't have the vintage fighters;  such as, Ken Shamrock, Tank Abbott, Don Frye, Dan Severn, Joyce Gracie,  Oleg Takatarov and so on. The game also has a create a player mode. The one  thing I didn't like about the mode is that when you pic a specific persons  style, you have their face on your player. I didn't care for that at all.  The game has several modes, including a UFC mode where the fighters square  off in a bracket tournament (classic UFC, the way it should be!!!). After  purchasing a disappointing game like World Series 2K1, this game made me  excited about the Dreamcast again!!"
5,I bought this on a whim and am very pleased with the purchase,I bought this on a whim and am very pleased with the purchase! You can think of it like a Harvest Moon action rpg if that makes sense.
1,Waste of Money,"I bought the mega Mahjongg and hoped that encore had fixed the problem with the game not working on Windows 7. Considering that all PCs now come with Windows 7 you would think they would.  No such luck.  The program works until it trys to access any information on the CD disk, then it freezes up and doesn't even want to close.  It is a waste of money to buy the program."
4,"Well built, good battery life,","Works really well.  Feels good in the hand, solid, enough weight. The d-pad is a bit inaccurate, registering some 'up' inputs on left and right inputs,  and the rumble feature feels a bit unpleasant relative to 1st party controller, too fast, loud and weak. But for the price you're getting good battery life, good thumbsticks, USB C charging,  and an overall well built device."
4,Worth it with one drawback,"First,this makes an absolute difference in the flying experience and is worth the buy. The biggest gripe I have about it definitely takes it down a peg because the R3 button is an extreme inconvenience since it makes it completely impossible to hold the joystick in the natural position for which it was designed. When you hold the stick this way you constantly press this button in any kind of light turn. For Ace Combat 7 this is designated as the weapon select button which makes employment very difficult unless you get used to holding the joystick very awkwardly. Like I said, still worth the buy, just be prepared to adjust your idea of how to hold this stick in a way that won't affect whatever game you use it with. To no fault to this product at all, Ace Combat 7 will not allow you to reassign the function of the flight stick's buttons which means there's no other way besides working around it to have smooth game play."
1,"IS A WASTE OF YOUR MONEY, DON'T BUY IT!","Majesco claims 250 plus games work with their wireless link, but they have not posted the list on there web site. Not one of my games work with their wireless link. I emailed Majesco and asked them to send me the list of the Gameboy Advanced games that do work with their product as none of my games have worked. Of course they have not responded to me.IT IS A WASTE OF YOUR MONEY, DON'T BUY IT!"
1,Missing game,Order and only received the ring and arm strap no game with it
1,Be careful!,Very disappointing!  If you buy this game make sure you read other reviews and go to the official website first!  No where on the box description of requirements does it state that you need one of two specific video cards in your computer!  It does say you need a 3D card with 32 MB - But it should also say on the box that you need one of two specific chipsets for your video card!  It did not say that on the box I bought!  Now I have a game that I cannot play! Trust me if you do not have a NVIDIA GeForce2 GTS or greater or ATI Radeon 7500 or greater chipset - it will not play!  I have tried everything!  In Amazon's requirements it does mention it but I did not come here first!  I will next time!
5,Don't miss this game!,"I have read a few reviews about Dracula: Origin on other sites that simply don't do this game justice.  From beautifully constructed and colored screens to good voice acting to haunting original music - this adventure gives everything to you and more.  The adventure game genre seems to have taken a back seat lately to first person combat shooters and hack and slash bloodfests, but I really think Frogwares (the creators of the recent Sherlock Holmes series including The Silver Earring, The Awakened, and Nemesis) is making a valliant effort toward rejuvinating this part of the industry.  Do yourself a favor and don't miss this game!"
5,An excellent replacement controller for the Wii.,"After several years, one of my two original  Wii controllers died.  I looked for fixes on the web, but found nothing that helped.  I chose this controller partly because it was an ""Amazon's Choice', but not before checking out the reviews.  As is often the case, several of the one star reviews seemed unjustified for various reasons.  I was further gratified to see a note from the seller inviting any dissatisfied buyer to contact them.  The controller comes with a silicone case and handle; all these parts are of good quality and well made.  The controller itself appears to be a good copy of the original, and it performed as well as the original on all the tests I could think to perform.  I'm very satisfied with the purchase."
1,Wait for a few patches...,"I picked up Civ IV the day it hit the shelves. Needless to say, I was extremely disappointed when I installed it and found I couldn't run it. The game is slow, the graphics are choppy and full of glitches, and the in-game cutscenes for the wonders cause frequent crashes. I shouldn't have any problems running this program; my system specs more than exceed the recommended system specs. Just another example of a game that was rushed into production without proper testing under real-world circumstances. What makes this game so frustratingly disappointing is the reputation Firaxis has built with its past games. Give this game a pass until Firaxis releases a patch or two."
5,Love the turtles!,I love this game and think that it is the best of the three games because you move through 3d space and all 4 turtles are with you at the same time. A lot of people have specific types of games that they favor and this is a review coming from someone who loves all kinds of games. I've beaten this game before and bought it again more than five years later because I had a hankering for a fun and long turtle game. I completely disagree with any of the negative reviews.
1,Forever load,"Why make a campaign game that you first buy disc, then spend 24 hours loading? For those that say "" Then don't buy online games"" I didn't. I purchased an overrated game to play a campaign. Steer clear."
5,Ive had this for a month and it works perfectly would not recommend going to gamestop and paying 70 dollars when this ...,"Was having an issue of my Xbox One not powering on. When I hit the power button it would chime and then turn off. I would have to unplug all the power cables and reset the power brick anywhere from 20-50 times to get the power brick light to turn white and then turn on my xbox. I youtubed countless videos, and none of them worked. I tried taking the power brick apart cleaning it, using a different cable, sticking in the cable to the back of the power brick halfway and wiggling it to try and discharge the static, none of that worked only hoping that after enough times of resetting the brick it would turn on. Ive had this for a month and it works perfectly would not recommend going to gamestop and paying 70 dollars when this is a perfect replacement."
5,The PSN codes are active finally .,Amazon sold download code for PSN that is inactive. Hope I can download it after release who knows. Vary unhappy right now. UPDATE  Finally was able to redeem code at 9:00pm EST.
5,Great for the price,"This is a great little keyboard for the price.  I was looking for a backlit TKL USB keyboard as a portable 2nd keyboard, and this has been great.  Great amount of light and easy to see in daylight. Good brightness adjustment and easy mode selection.  It's very clicky and feels well built."
4,Great sound but mic is flawed,Fantastic sound but the mic picks up the audio somehow which makes it frustrating for anyone else on comms. I can turn down my sensitivity but then I have to speak quite loud to activate the mic. There's no good middle ground and we've resorted to my buddies accepting a bit of background noise.
5,Works just like the original,"This cable works great, I lost my original cable and needed a replacement so I decided to get a longer cable while im at it.  Cable is nice sleek black and works great.  We will see how it holds up!"
5,Fantastic fun.,"I'm not a gamer. I barely play anything more than 10-15 minutes. This game kept my attention for 4 straight hours outta the box. Great layouts, great fun. The only minor annoyance is the dialogue during the cut scenes. Overall, I'd recommend to anyone that enjoys any of the Cabela's games."
1,Horrible game. Just like 15 you can't see any ...,What a joke! Horrible game. Just like 15 you can't see any attributes in free agency. Makes franchise mode unplayable
5,Good Game for Casual Gamer,"I have always enjoyed MMORPG's.  I like the community (usually) and i like the teamwork that is involved.  Unfortunately most of the MMORPG's I have played haved been strictly group oriented.  Meaning that you have to find a good group to do anything worthwhile.  Seeing as I was a casual gamer who would sometimes not play for stretches at a time i usually did not join a guild.  And in most other MMORPG's soloing after a certain level is not an option.  I think World of Warcraft is great.  I love the game and will be preordering it.  The quests are simple and straightforward.  All you have to be able to do is read the quest log it almost always gives you directions.  The game also flows easily and leveling is not too easy but at the same time it is not that difficult.  Which is great, meaning i dont have to spend every waking moment playing the game.  This is a game for casual gamers, Blizzard has stated this was their target demographic.  For all the hardcore MMORPG players there is always EQ2.  I personally will have my time split from school, halo 2, and WOW."
4,Great for early childhood,"My son is 5. He loves this game, but I can see him growing out of it quickly. It's a nice game to start out with for a child 5 or under. I like how Grover, Elmo, and the fairy (forgot her name) engage my children. ( I also have a 2 year old. She loves the game also.)"
1,NOT compatible with ALL games and the manual shift does not work unlsess game specific,Its cool but its over calibrated this making turning on even agter adjusting the settings on the controller and the game and the manual shift is practically useless unless the game u have is compatible
5,Compact controller,"Connects quickly via Bluetooth on my IPhone 6s Plus. I played dead trigger 2, minecraft, gta sa, mc5, pac-man256, mc5, dh4, without any issues. One thing to remember is when connecting to Bluetooth don't mess with the joysticks or buttons when it connects because it calibrates when connecting, if you accidentally pushed the joystick controls things will be all messed up. Reset the connection will fix that issue quickly. The controller feels good in the hand sturdy and of good quality. Its small but not to small your thumbs kind of touch when using the dual joysticks. After playing with the controller for about 2 weeks I can say it really changes iOS game in a good way. The cons are the controller has no clamp to hold a phone and it's a small controller, people with big hands will have trouble. All in all its a good buy."
1,waste of money,Never stays loaded online and EA site seems to always be down.  I got it 5 days ago and haven't been able to play once!  Worthless.
1,Great Case with a Fatal Design Flaw,"I really loved this case until I realized that it had a really big design flaw. There is no space allowance for the power button, so every time you put it in the case, or even move the case, it presses the power button and turns the unit on. The unit will eventually go to sleep, but in the meantime it drains the battery, and causes the Quest to get warm. I am sending this back for a refund, but I will purchase again if they fix this flaw. Until they do, it is pretty useless! Another small gripe is that the storage area for the charger and cord does not hold those items very well. A zippered pouch would have been better."
5,Exactly As Expected,"Long battery life with short charge times, Great game, and Fun."
4,Challenging,"At 1st, I got my but kicked. They take some getting used to. But if you can survive the learning curve, they really do help. Not for everybody, but those who get it, will benefit."
1,Worst out of box experience ever,"Very disappointed with this thing.  Essentially no games come with the device.  Immediately said my firmware was out of date and hour later it had charged the batteries, and hour after that it had downloaded new firmware.  Then logged into store and spent 90 min downloading Grand Turisimo which then took another 30 minutes to install.  Not compatible with any cable or charger from other PSPs.  Charger is huge and cumbersome and proprietary.  No USB cables.  Purchase an older PSP, you can still download things if you want and will have access to your UMD games and a used game market.  Except for being slightly smaller there is zero advantage to buying this over the other models of PSP which have more feature and more compatibility.  This thing was a mistake."
1,Horrible Horrible version. Borderline fraud.,This version is horrible. They did not provide any of the new content that was put on the Xbox one.
4,Teen fave!,"My teen son loves his new wireless headset.  He can now get in on all the gaming fun with a great earpiece that doesn't hurt his ear within the first 10 minutes.  Great reception, great battery charge life, great price.  He didn't love the color I picked for him, lol, he would have wanted blue or brown.  But he loves that he can find it easy on the couch, etc., because of the flame colors.  Good purchase."
5,Very happy with my purchase!,"The 360 came quickly. I was able to download Skyrim with no issues. The system works Great! I have yet to try the Forza Motorsport 4, as I was more interested in Skyrim. I used to have a 360, but gave it to my sister, and then I bought this one for myself. I would highly recommend this bundle to anyone who is looking to buy the 360. While someone did state you get one month of xbox live with this bundle, you actually get 2 months. You get one code for a free 1 month gold membership and then you will find a 2nd code that will give you a month of free gold membership, so you do get a total of 2 months worth of gold through this bundle. Though I do recommend to just go ahead and get the code for the 12 month of xbox live and while use the 2 free months and then after you are done with the 2 free months, use the 12 month code."
5,Finally A 500GB Is Here!!!,After putting in this HDD you'll come out to have 461GB left over out of the 500GB. Having just upgraded from a full 320GB (294GB) I must say that this HDD does the job if you have a huge digital library with a lot of DLC and want to play original Xbox games as well.
5,This game has it all!,"I have played many baseball games over the years...Hardball...the Triple Play series; High Heat 2001 is by far the best in it's field (so to speak).  After the initial frustration of learning to time the pitcher and actually  hit the baseball I have learned to love this game.  Instead of hitting 25  home runs a game as in Triple Play, you have to actually develop the skill  of trying to out guess the pitcher and of being patient at the plate just  like the Major Leagues. The graphics and playability are awesome, from pass  balls to bad throws, errors, hitting the cuttoff man, placing the  bunt...and so on, this is real baseball. The general manager options of  developing a farm team and making roster moves makes this game a total  baseball experience. So, if your team is struggling, just edit a few of  your hitter's abilities and averages and the next thing you know you will  be fighting for a pennant.  Baseball simulation lovers don't miss this one,  get it today!"
2,Properly disappointed for the 1st time,Was thinking of buying changed my mind after renting from local movie store it not as great as other years (song wise) and the formatting this year is very confusing. Gave it 2 stars for the effort of trying to make it work as to the songs would have liked a bit more variety.
1,Junk,"If I could give it 1 star, I would.  Tension doesn't work; knob just spins.  Can't take it apart to repack it."
1,misleading description,"based off the description i thought i was receiving a playstation 4, not just the game! the wording of the product is very misleading and apparently im not the only one who fell for it"
1,A huge step backwards for Bioware,"I'll keep this short. DA1 was merely ok for me, but DA2 is pretty awful. Take Dragon Age 1, take out all the RPG elements and free roaming (replace with linear path of point A to B), add generic dungeons and a lame story and you are left with DA2."
4,Better if you've played Rhythm Boxing,"The tutorial in the beginning was basic and sort of showed how you would play the game (but there's lots of other moves). I play Rhythm Boxing on the switch pretty regularly and feel it definitely helped me understand better what was going on. You can see the moves for practice and that helped but if I had zero experience with boxing prior, I may have felt a bit overwhelmed. That being said, I got this because of the kick boxing aspect and I definitely felt like I got a better ab workout. It took a lot more coordination on my end. Rhythm Boxing has a nice setup for right and lefts. This game puts everything in a row in colored circles (blue for one side and pink for the other) - but I found myself constantly switching them up. However a few practices and I started to get better. As far as tracking goes, it really only tracks arm movements, legs are just given even if you don't do it. So you COULD cheat, but what's the point. People watch workout videos with ZERO tracking, so to me, this isn't a big deal. You get out of it what you put into it. I do wish I could do more than one daily workout (like in Rhythm Boxing). Sometimes I like to do  two shorter morning and evening workouts. Instead you have to do a bunch of mini sets in the 3-min workout section if you want more. Again, not a big deal, but I like not having to choose my whole workout. Just hit the daily option and the game can pick it for me. I'll update my review after a few more workouts, but so far I think it has potential."
5,Orange is the new black,"I am an avid FPS (Battlefield 1, SW Battlefront) gamer and was ready to try something new to up my game. I had gotten FPS freeks for the Xbox 360 many years ago and didn't realize that they really do make a difference. I love that I can make even the most minute adjustments in my aim. For you FPS gamers I feel that most games clicking on the left stick is how you sprint, and your thumb starts to slip or gets tired? Well these fix that problem. They are super comfy. Don't be deterred by the funky look because they are well worth it! If your first few games aren't what you'd like just give it time because they do work. I hope you get these and see you on the battlefield. Please take note if this review was helpful to you."
5,THIS IS THE SWITCH DOCK TO HAVE!!!,"This switch cooling stand is exactly as pictured. The fan doesn't run unless the switch or TV is running, depending on choice of setup. I have run my switch on this for several hours upon receiving it and then picking it up for some bedtime mobile play and the switch is as cooler than the ambient room temperature. I feel like this product is better than the cooling system that attaches to the original switch dock because the cooling gan on this is RIGHT against the back of the switch, versus the dock attachable cooler, which essentially cools the back of the dock, not the back of the system itself. This particular dock also has a small angled cutout that matches the one on the back of the switch which helps the switch not wobble while docked, and it feels VERY locked in. This is the dock to have if you are a TV screen player for sure."
1,Disappointed,"If you loved the first DS Lego Harry Potter game (as I did), prepare to be disappointed with this one.  I just got this game today and have just started, so perhaps I should give it more time, but thought I would give my first impressions.  This game seems inferior in every way to Harry Potter Years 1-4.  It is hard to believe that it is put out by the same company.  The graphics aren't as clear and the controls are horrible.  What I thought was fun with the first game was being able to do spells with the stylus. In fact, being able to use the stylus for everything.  With this game, for example, you have to hold the Y button to ""charge"" your spell, then the A button to use it.  You move the characters around with the control pad, not the stylus.  The whole reason I use the DS gaming system is because I like using the stylus, it is what makes the games unique, in my opinion.  I remember I heard about the first game, and it seemed like it took forever to come out, but it was worth it when you played it.  This game seems rushed, like they wanted to get it out by Christmas or something, so they just threw it together for the DS without using any of the components unique to the DS.  It might be a great game for Playstation.  Again, I have just started playing this so maybe it will get better, but I wish I had read a review or two before getting it.  I would have gotten it used instead of buying it new."
4,"Not the best, probably not the worst",One of the fans has a slight flicker. Other than that they installed fine and the remote provides lots of options for motherboards that don't support led control.
4,Great game without the cheats,"The sounds, music, and minigolf physics are great.  I could never complain about that. The only problem is the cheats.  I played against people online, and they were acing even 7 out of 9 holes!  Where's the fun in that?  I did learn one cheat, but the game is so boring when you play with it.  Plus, that hole is pretty much ruined for me, since I now always get a guaranteed hole-in-one on it. It doesn't take too long to get used to the game (only fifteen minutes of putting around, and then you get the general idea of how hard to swing, etc.)  Some of the holes, especially in the deluxe course, take a long time to load (I had it on a 100 mhz computer), unless you either have a better computer, or do the full install (I recommend both.)  If you do the full install, you can play without the CD. Don't learn the cheats; they ruin the game.  Plus, if you play online, the scores of the people you play against DO get posted on your computer's high score list, so think twice about playing against cheaters. The race mode is cool (get the ball in the hole as fast as you can) while the hole-by-hole mode is pretty dumb (it gives you a point if you win against someone else; gives them a point if they lose.)  The normal mode is cool. Three nine-hole courses, three modes.  What more could you want?"
5,Amazing headset,Got this for Christmas and so far it has been working wonders. I can hear everything perfectly and the mic works.
1,Left Joy-Con slot stopped charging...,"After five months of owning this dock, I'm experiencing a similar problem as noted in other reviews: the left joy-con slot blinks red and no longer provides a charge to that controller. I tested the controller by charging it off the Switch itself, and it worked fine. This is a good looking product, but it seems like inferior quality control..."
1,SLOW GAMES,"MAJOR ISSUE IS THAT IT THE GAME IS AWSOME, EXCEPT THAT IT DOESNT RUN WELL ON A COMPUTER. I DONT KNOW WHAT THEY DID WRONG, BUT I HEARD THAT NVIDIA IS WORKING ON A SOLUTION FOR THE GRAPHIC ISSUES PEOPLE SEEM TO HAVE, ALONG WITH SLOW PERFORMANCE. I HAVE 4 GIGS of ram, windows vista 64-bit, 512MB graphics, and core 2 duo with 2.7ghz, and 250gigs of ram, and it doesnt run well even if I reduce all the graphic settings in the game. i can play; Crisis, GTA San Andreas, and Call of Duty 4, just fine with no problems at all. I recomend that people wait to buy this game for PC, unless they are sure it will work well on their system."
5,Cute case for the NEW Nintendo 3DS XL,Let me start with THIS CASE IS ADORABLE! I was looking for a case for my New Nintendo 3DS XL and came across these Nyan Cyber cases. This case fits perfectly on my 3DS XL and I couldn't be any happier. I would recommend this case for anyone looking for a case for their NEW Nintendo 3DS XL or LL (Japan model). The cutouts on this case will not work for the former 3DS XL model.
1,Holds only the switch and no accessories,We purchased this because the picture showed it holding two extra joy-cons and a cable. Obviously they never tried to close the case. The first thing is there is nothing to hold the switch into the case. Ours can fall out if opened incorrectly. 2nd we had 2 extra joy-cons and 4 safety strap pieces in the case (as pictured) and could not close it withou putting more pressure than I was comfortable on the switch and joy-cons. Really disappointed with this purchase and would not recommend it.
5,Very cool Botw Amiibo!,"I love the Amiibo so much the design of Revali and his kin are so well done and to have him as a Amiibo is awesome. The package came a little later than expected and was marked as prime, but came in almost a week after. Other than the shipping process I would reccomend this Amiibo to any collectors out there or if you simply want the in game items this guy gives you in Zelda Botw. I attached a image to display the helmet you get in game."
1,The product arrived intact in its packaging but it is ...,"The product arrived intact in its packaging but it is poorly made; it's not even close to feeling as dense as the original Xbox controller. Everytime I try to play a game, midway it tells me to reconnect it and press start, this happened several times and I haven't had it longer than 48 hours. I had to jiggle the cord for it to work for another ten minutes before it would cut out again. My original Xbox controller that is15 years old lasted longer."
4,"Save the batteries, save the wallet","For any Wii gamers out there, a charging station is a necessity since lets face it, AAs become expensive after a while. While this charger is fast, the power cells aren't as long lasting as the manual claims. However, it is still a life saver for Wii gamers and a good addition to the set up."
5,This controller is a better value for the money than the Microsoft controller.,The controller is a great value for the money. I bought it for my husband during prime days. He is incredibly pleased with it. He uses it on his Xbox One and he uses it a lot. He did mention that the stick is more sensitive than the official Xbox controller he replaced.
1,NOT EVEN WORTH THE CHEAP PRICE!!,"In all honesty, this has got to be one of the worst games I have played in some time. At its' best, the game can be fun for a few minutes when your blasting the Akrid to pieces but at its' worst, this game is clumsy, glitchy, slow and your character always feels encumbered while moving. I got this game because I was interested in completing the lost planet trilogy but boy did I waste 8 hours of my life beating this game! I think the only plausible excuse for this game would be that it is so dated; even still, there are games that came out around this time with much better mechanics and graphics. Oh, and for those achievement hunters out there; DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME, IT WILL ONLY NET YOU 5 gamerscore for beating the game. Would not recommend to anyone!"
5,Great cord.,This works great and came quickly..
5,Good case. Solid construction. Smells fine??,"Not sure why the top review is complaining about the smell. Smells like nothing unless you stick your nose in it, in which case it smells like new rubber."
5,this game was one of the best,this game was on of the best nancy drew video games for nintendo ds.  it really kept you thinking and i found it to be fun to play!  if you really like games that make you think and keep you interested this is a good one to try. the only downfall was i finished it in a day and a half!
5,Phineas and Ferb Fantastic,Since this was opened we have to order it being turned off for meals and homework. It has been on every car ride and entertained on every off moment. A successful purchase for an 8 year old.
5,made of metal so cool!,bought for my wife for mothers day. Originally went looking for a good mouse but found this combo for the same price as most mice in the same grade. The metal construction really blew me away!
5,Silver Edition,"This Silver Box Edition includes the entire gameplay on one disc, instead of 2 like the normal enhanced edition. There is also a bonus disc that has no material relevant to actual gameplay."
5,I recommend it,"It makes my 2DS feels more comfortable, the quality not the best but I love having it on because just few mins without it, my hands starts to hurt and I got big hands but the grip makes for good gaming session"
5,So happy this came out for the switch lite!,For the price this case is amazing. It comes in a snorlax box I couldn't throw away! It holds the games tightly which prevents them from slipping out and has room for my switch with a case on it.
5,awesome,"works perfectly for for emulators, just plug it in and it works great"
5,Great quality!,Love it! Bought my son something similar to this when I first purchased his switch. It was hard and plastic piece kept coming off so I ordered this one. I love the material and it still fits his switch perfectly even with his skin on it.
1,Need a lawsuit,I think its time for class action suit against Bethesda's . This has been reviewed as game of the year.Sure its paid advertisement. Companies like these should be made to pay back customers all of the money by having them send a prepaid return for the games and with a few million dollar law suit so that they don't drive customers for a ride.
5,A Must-have for WFH.,"Works perfectly as expected. However, it's not a hidden device as it's easy to tell that you are using a Mouse jiggler when you check it under Windows Device Manager."
1,Are you serious???,"This game is ridiculous!  In the bathroom of the players apartment, they put the toilet paper roll on backwards!!!  WHO WOULD DO THIS????  This is so saddistic and pure evil to put the Toilet paper roll on backwards!!!!  Do not buy this game!"
1,NOT WOrtH IT!,DOESN'T WORK! DO NOT DOWNLOAD! NO RETURNS EITHER!
5,Kids are happy,Kids are happy
1,"Pretty little system, but not real sturdy","I bought my first DS Lite two months ago. Within three weeks, the top right hinge, which houses the metal mechanism that allows the top section to lock into position while open, broke. I took the unit back to Walmart, and they gave me another one no questions asked. I've had this one six weeks. And tonight the top right hinge broke again.In the exact same place. It's too late to take it back to Wally world, and I'm stuck with sending it back to Nintendo for repairs. I've opted to do my own with Crazy Glue, which for the time being (I hope ) holds it together until I can repurchase the old model again. The Lite is a pretty little thing, but I have serious concerns that the top right hinge is an engineering problem. Please keep in mind that I open and shut mine several times a day, but still, I think the hinge structure is just too flimsy."
5,Fun Game,Very good game it your child likes lego and Dinosaurs. Our 8 year old enjoyed the game a lot. Only downfall might be that it's to short and he seemed to complete the game quickly. I would highly recommend Lego World and the sandbox mode if your child likes lego's and building.
5,"Massive Indie Game, Not a AAA Game","Personally, I love this game.  There is plenty to do if you are willing to do it yourself.  There is very little direction in this game.  Until recently, you had to find most everything on your own.  Since the two major updates base building is probably your best bet to start the game.  It gives you much-needed blueprints and the ability to explore further with the ability to get the resources needed to do so.  I would like to emphasise that THIS IS NOT A AAA GAME.  This is an indie game.  This game can be a lot of fun so long as you are okay with creating your own fun.  Unlike most games where there is a lot of hand holding the feeding you loads of story this game does almost none of that.  There is lore a depth on planets about the different sentient alien species and robotic sentinels, but  they more mostly individual pieces and not a large interwoven mystery like most AAA games.  The game's art takes a lot from 70s Sci-Fi books and their covers.  This means a lot of very colorful planets, ships, and creatures.  Since the game is procedurally generated you will see some of the most bizarre and illogical creature designs but that, in my opinion, is part of the charm.  This game has the potential to keep you entertained for the rest of your life but I doubt it will for most.  It is a fun game to put down and pick back up when you are looking for a fun relaxing time and not sure what game to play.  I prefer to send down with a beer and let my mind disappear into No Man's Sky."
5,Very good but delicate.,"Excellent product.  Easy to install and works well.  I do wish it had something stabilizing the side opposite the plug because the controllers stick into the slots very well, and you could break the unit while removing them.  Handle it carefully and it will serve you well.  Good luck getting your children to do so, though. Perhaps some velcro or double sided tape would work."
4,Amazing and I love them,"The range on these headphones is unbeilvable, I can be pooping from many feet away and still talk to all my friends in skype. Amazing and I love them."
5,Good controller,"It has a very slick design, and works very well with Elite: Dangerous. The joystick has an adjustable tension knob on the bottom, and it comes with an allen wrench to make it one piece, or two separate ones. It is a good product"
5,Essential Part For Fight Sticks!,"The Sanwa octagonal gate is a must-have part in fighting games. While the 4-way gate that comes with standard issue joysticks serves it's purpose, the ability to lock-in moves with this 8-way gate makes it an essential purchase. This gate worked perfectly with the Sanwa joystick I purchased, and it's given me the much needed improvement in motion that I was looking for. Don't purchase a Sanwa joystick without getting this essential part too. Two thumbs up!"
1,"Characters are terrible, story is intellectually lacking","Characters are terrible, story is intellectually lacking, combat system is more akin to Skyrim, Magic is essentially useless, side quests are boring, voice acting is atrocious. Bottom line is that the game will be fun for anyone not old enough to remember FFXIII or earlier. For those of you who do and are looking for something with a Final Fantasy feel don't but this game."
5,Best video game I've ever played,If you are competitive and willing to invest time this is a no brain buy. I usually get sick of playing a game after a month or two. That includes xbox 360 games and PC games. This is the first that has completely gotten into my head. I love it. Just realize that it takes a while to learn and way longer to get good.
1,Activision Quality Release,Just want to echo what a lot of reviews are already stating. MOP is yet another release that fails to meet the high quality standards of the Blizzard we knew before the merger with Activision.
1,Trash,"What is this world coming to? I can't believe my wife and I waited four years for the next ""real"" Tomb Raider game, only to find that it is so violent that it really should be just burned. We tried to play the ""Drake"" games but quickly tired of those because all they are, are shoot-fests: get to a new location, shoot it out with 50 goons; get to the next location and shoot it out with another 50 goons, etc. etc. Tomb Raider 2013 is just like that, except for an alarming addition: enhanced gore. Blood spatters on the screen constantly. When you're done shooting most of the goons, you're likely to get hacked apart by another goon wielding a machete. Dead, tortured, skinned bodies abound (in just about every scene). You wade through decomposed body filth, with detached arms, legs, and heads everywhere. If you get caught you might get your throat cut, very graphically. If you fall in a river you will get (again, graphically) impaled in the neck by a branch. You might be impaled by a goon wielding a lance and swung about (graphically, until you die....). What kind of supposed human being builds such a game? If you are one of those people, please listen: you need psychiatric help. The same can be said for the game construction management. And, I suppose, the people that actually like this game have issues, too. No wonder there are killings in schools all the time these days! Everybody is going to respond that I should grow up; the game is rated mature; other games are like that, etc. Well, I don't play those ""other"" games because they are so violent; the old Tomb Raider games were not like that; and I believe I had good reason to expect that this Tomb Raider game would be similar to the old ones. Bring back the (probably now-retired) designers of Tomb Raider Legend and Tomb Raider Underworld!"
5,Timeless Chocolates,"In my household, Ferrero Rocher go quickly -- quicker then any other gourmet chocolate. This stuff is good, and for the 18 bucks I bought it for, can't be beat."
4,Great price good product,Good looking stand makes your PS3 standout even more. I have mine hooked up in my home theater room were its pretty dark beause i have a front projector so when I'm watching blu ray movies it really looks cool.I have a PS3 80(gb) and door opens up easily dont know what people are talking about.
5,Definitely a must for your gaming headset. Inexpensive,Excellent silicone face mask cover for gammers. Very soft yet thick and comfortable to wear with your head set. Keeps dust and dirt out and sweat from dripping. Easy to remove for cleaning. Eye covers as well. Very sanitary if more than one person is using your set. Very inexpensive.
5,BUY IT. NO QUESTIONS.,"Ignore the one star ratings... they are just orders gone wrong, the actual game itself is B E A UTIFUL in the words of Ace Venture. This game offers everything you could imagine in a racing game!! Have control over everything! If you enjoyed any of the past Horizons this game is a no brained to buy! And if this is your first racing game then you might need to brace yourself, it's a lot of awesomeness to take in at once! If you enjoy the beauty of cars, the fun of racing and customizing and amazing gameplay this game is for you! Doesn't matter the age! You like old cars? They have them. You like the newer cars? They have those too. If you need more info or details on the game I recommend watching YouTube videos. This game is legit and after reading this review I hope you are convinced to buy it!"
5,For girls around ages 6-8,Very Young girls who read well can enjoy this My Baby switch game
1,No split screen co op.  Ruined halo night.,No split screen co op.  Crushed.  My husband and I were looking forward to a new halo home date night game.  Ruined.
5,Nice deal,It worth the money
5,Grate cost-effective addition to any gaming setup,Product is great brings all the keys to my fingers I don't have to reach for anything
1,I've ordered this item and I didn't open it as ...,"I've ordered this item and I didn't open it as it was a gift for my son and once we opened it, the controller doesn't seem to charge or turn on. Left it overnight as we thought it needed a longer time to charge but to this date, the controller doesn't work. I wish I could return it and get an exchange for this item. I don't want money back, I just want an item that works. Hopefully this happens."
1,Way over priced,Way way way over priced
1,Rip off,This is such a ripoff
5,"Great game, can't wait to play it on the PS8",This is a great game every time I play it.  Can't wait to see how it looks like on the PS8.
1,"Very disappointed, sorry I bought this game.  Really feel ripped off by it.","Not the game I was hoping for, basically an online game only, nothing like before. I really wish I could return it.  It also does not support my wheel that worked great on the previous version. Now I need to drop another 300.00 on a when to platy a game that stinks.  I'll go back to XBOX one and play the new Forza, and buy a wheel for that instead."
5,Love this game!,I bought this game for my teenage son.  He says he just loves it.  It is the most fun game ever. He plays it all the time when he's not in school or doing chores or homework.  He says it is the best game he's played.
5,Five Stars,Worked perfectly with my Xbox one
1,wtf,I just have a few questions....
5,Just what I wanted but NOT MECHANICAL,"This is exactly what I wanted. The keyboard is nice and quite with expected but decent rgb leds for the price. I want to stress that the keyboard is not actually mechanical, but mechanical feeling. Keys are nice and tactile but I will say that you do have to get a decent amount of travel sometimes for the keyboard to register. Great for the price though. I'll update if anything changes."
5,Hard. But worth it.,"First off, ignore the little 12 year old cry babies who are hating on it. ITS A ROGUE LIKE GAME. For all you console plebs who dont pc game, it is MEANT to be HARD. It is MEANT to RESET your progress. This is the GENRE. Return your game and go back to fortnite, youre not wanted in this community you babies."
5,"This game does not deserve to be ""Flushed Away""!","This game is great fun to play and is like jumping right into the movie! Good for all ages and skill levels it provides for hours of fun! If you liked the movie, you'll love the game. If you didn't see the movie, you will still like this game!"
5,Wonderful purchase.,I cannot begin to say how much I love this case. Well designed. Does not affect game play at all. And by my picture provided you can see that it dock comfortably. This is a must buy if you want to add some protection to your switch. Thank you to the seller. This is a wonderful product.
5,Best purchase I have ever made!!!,This has got to be one of the best items I have ever bought!!! The Xbox Series X fits perfectly and the cooling fan works amazing!!! Also the duel charging dock for the controllers works amazing. It has light indicators to tell you when your battery is full. You also get 2 rechargable battery packs!!! Last but not least it hold 10 games and has a headphone stand!!! This is a must have if you have the series x!!! I highly recommend!!!
5,Great system if you can get past the price.,"Got this after upgrading to a 4k UHD TV it is way better than what I had ( Original Xbone with old style controller). Games look great in 4k, and everything seems smoother than my old system. It even seems like online functionality is better."
5,Would recommend!,"Love it! Have used it for a week with no issues, let my friend borrow it now he is considering buying one for himself. Good battery life, feels just like the name brand controllers."
2,Absolutely no reason to remove Franchise mode and things attached,"That wasn't what was broke in the game.  No import draft class, no fantasy draft.  Clock continues to run when there are possession changes.  Buggy, and horrible.  Just no reason for this to happen.  NONE!  We want our normal Franchise back EA."
5,Five Stars,Awesome!
5,"Comfortable, Great Sound","I'm not a kid, I have an Adult-size head and this fits great, they stay put and you can move them easily in adjusting to your ear. They rest half inch from my neck without touching or hindering my comfort. You can slide them down and they rest around your neck like a half horseshoe (I use them with my ipod and my DS too) I HATE EARBUDS, they hurt my ears... this item is great for anyone that hates earbuds like me.... I listen to full movies on PSP with these and the sound is clear and rich."
1,Just there to take your money.,"I was very excited when I first heard about this game.  I'll start off by saying I have been a long time Sims fan.  I especially love Sims 3 and still play to this day.  That being said this game is absolutely a waste of your money.  If you  are a fan of the complex way that the Sims 3 plays and the many different aspects of life you can control, you will not be satisfied with this game.  Everything is done for you.  You can't select where you want to build your buildings, and all quests you do are completely railed onto a track that is completely pointed out for you.  This game could possibly be fun for a younger child who would enjoy the questing and customizing.  However, the customization level is much smaller than the normal Sims games and the quests are boring as possibly can be.  Don't waste your money like I did.  Quests literally point out every single step you must take, and the castle customization options are weak and obsolete."
2,If you like jumping puzzles,"Donkey Kong with a gun. If you like jumping puzzles, this is your game."
1,Poor quality,"Their transfers from VHS tape to DVD were very poorly done.  I've used Roxio software to do it myself and it turned out much much better.  The Legacybox DVDs appeared to have interference or poor cable connections as the light and colors in the scenes flashed continuously when played.  Also, I wanted the option of getting the transfers on a flash drive and that option was never given to me.  When I emailed them they said it was too late."
5,The stickers are for dust removal,"Great product for a great price. It's a bit bulkier than the first one I had purchased, but it's hardly noticeable visibility wise and the touch sensitivity isn't effected at all by it. If anything, it's just more protection. The dust removal stickers are extremely adhesive, make sure they go directly in the trash or on a scrap piece of paper when you are finished with them. I ripped the paint off my wall being negligent with them."
1,Online or off line still disapointing,"I waited until the day this game came out to buy it.I was hoping for this game to be really fun like RE1,2,3 and code veronica but when I put it in I was Uterly disapointed,the game play was very bad with very bad controls,The other Resident Evil games had better controls.The other thing is that this game had no story line, you just start off in a bar and run from zombies.Do not get this game just wait for RE4."
5,Good Game,Good game
5,Half vs Full Body cover... this is full body.,"This is probably something you don't think about, we certainly didn't... We just searched for Nintendo Switch Lite cases and picked one out. Initially, we got one of those soft TPU ones, but then we realized the top is exposed. So we continued searching and we found this listing. If you want FULL body protection, these 2 piece hard shell cases are what you want. However, you should consider this ""con"" before making your decision... You see the Switch buttons and directional pad protrude above the surface only by a little, so by placing a case layer on top, it makes the buttons almost feel flush to the surface. It's not completely flush, they are still raised above the case, but barely. You will need to feel for yourself and decide if this is right for you. I still give the case 5 stars because it does the job, and includes 2 glass screen protectors and cute thumb grips. A lot of bang for your buck!"
5,A Great Game,"I'm sure no one will read this review as my sister and I were probably the only kids that grew up playing Whacked. But for those crazy enough to know about it and consider buying it, please do. It is a fantastic game. There is lots of violence, but it is cute and fun violence! The weapons are rubber duck bombs and staple guns. The only downside is that one of the characters is a scandalously dressed woman that is a little degrading. Being a female, I am slightly angered for all female-kind by this character, but I still give the game 5 stars. Everything else outweighs the one character."
5,It really works!,Works fine
5,For All Soccer Fans,"My 9-year old son is an avid soccer player. After the World Cup he really became interested in its history and teams. We bought the game for a fraction of price and since then it became his favorite game topping the new Mario Bros. It gives a sense of participating in real games. As an additional bonus, he likes to locate the countries he is playing with on the map and find facts about them. Money well spent."
5,You get access to currently over 170 games and all future Microsoft first party exclusives like sea of Thieves and the new state of decay,This is not a gold subscription. Do not listen to Jason's review. He obviously has no idea what he is talking about. Game pass only comes in 1 month for 9.99 cards a 6 months for 60. You get access to currently over 170 games and all future Microsoft first party exclusives like sea of Thieves and the new state of decay.
4,This is a great controller with only one exception.,"I love this controller, it's awesome.  The only thing is that the left and right buttons above the triggers wear out too fast, about six months they last.  Now to be fair I use those buttons about 5 times as much as any of the other buttons, or triggers.  So being fair and impartial, the controller is great and will last the average user ( I'll say the average user, puts 6 hours a week on the device, I put like 25 hours, kids for one reason ) long enough that is way worth it's value."
1,Fell apart within a couple weeks,"The plastic cracked,  exposing the wiring inside,  within 2 weeks of getting the cable.  Spend a few bucks more and get something that won't immediately break"
1,Looks good but didn't work.,"When I got mine, it looked in good condition. Not a scratch on it. Charged it,  then started putting in games to make sure they loaded. Everything looked good till I then tried to play a game. The screen would not react to touch by finger or stylus pen. Sent back for refund."
5,Soo much fun,"I only bought the Wii now, even though it has been out for years. I really wish I had bought one sooner. It is cheaper than PS3 (the console I would normally buy if I had to get just 1), but I don't like the collection of games PS3 has right now. They definitely have more, but I feel like the games are mostly geared towards guys, and they're missing the cute games like Mario that I grew up on. This bundle comes with Wii Sports and Sports Resort, which are incredibly fun. If you're not one to go out and play sports, this is the next best thing. Nintendo Wii is affordable for most people too unlike the PS3. Definitely recommended for adults and kids alike."
4,An Almost perfect game.,"I have now completed two of the Layton games completely.  I will say that I enjoyed the majority of both as they give a fun story to read and partly watch while going along.  In this game, I was happy that there were far more videos that the previous one that I played (I believe it is called the Curious Village).  In this game, you continue to get more of the same puzzles.  There are some repeats with a slight difference.  An example of this is one where you transport a group across water with certain conditions.  In the previous game, it was wolves and chicks, and it was now parents and children in this game.  There are plenty of extras, however, in this game that make the game more enjoyable and a bit different from the previous ones.  One complaint that I have with the game, however, is that sometimes the wording of the puzzles is a bit misleading or they are trying to trick you.  Instead of straight puzzles, they might give you one, but you were supposed to realize that they wanted you to flip the screen upside down for a totally different answer.  In other words, it's not that flipping the screen is the only answer, there was another that you thought was right.  You then get the answer wrong, watch the screen crumble or the character hide their head in shame, and waste hint coins being told that you were supposed to have turned the screen upside down.  This does not ruin the game, but just be prepared for some misguiding puzzles here and there that make you say ""oh come on.""  Overall, it gets a 4 due to some repeated puzzles as well as a few misguided or misleading ones."
5,Awesome!,Feels nice and sleek. Good packaging and came with batteries! (:
5,Great charger,Great charger. Comes with 2 batteries for the xbox one that charge fast and last for hours. Great charger for the money would buy again.
5,The best of games in every aspect.,"I don't want to sound like an extrimist, but this is literally the best game I've ever played. The story is extremely engaging, as I constantly found myself anxios to see what happens next.  The graphics are superb,  and the game engine is perfect! You can pan around in 360 degress. And as  you turn, the sounds around you rotate accordingly. The worlds you travel  to are brilliantly designed, each putting you in a different mood, somehow  drawing you into the game (I know I sound looney when I say this, but this  is true).  You can also have conversations with characters, even assume  their forms to get more info out of them. And there are more items to pick  up then ever! In short, this is one game that you won't want to miss."
4,A good budget headset,"I feel this headset is a good purchase for the cost point. If you want to play while your spouse or kids are asleep, or have children who are rough on electronics, this is the turtle beach headset you'd want to buy. It runs off the battery life in your controller, no need to charge it, no need for batteries of its own. The mic is detachable, and can be removed for those of you who aren't feeling social. It has a volume control on the wire, but admittedly, I don't use it as I control it through my Xbox. That's where most of the good qualities of this particular headset end. Sound quality won't wow you, the set itself feels to be made of cheap plastic and pleather. It's one of those headsets you buy when it's for a younger child or a casual gamer who just needs to be able to hear the game without the added surround sound and directional sound typically associated with a higher end headset. This headset will play sound, but won't quite give you the competitive edge that a lot of gamers today are looking for."
5,It works just fine and does everything it's supposed to,"It works just fine and does everything it's supposed to. Works just like an Xbox controller, and Steam finds function out of the central button (which I kind of thought was just for show, at first). Great buy if you're just looking for a cheap and functional controller, especially just to try out PC controllers for the first time. This was my first one, and so far I love it. I've mostly played Final Fantasy and a little bit of Shadow of Mordor, and both are great."
5,GREAT AND LOADS OF FUN STAR WARS GAME...,I can't Believe some of these sour reviews. This Is A FUN GREAT Game. You play as if your In the Clone Wars animated series on Cartoon Network. Except Way Better. You get to play as all the main characters through the game. Playing as Many different Jedi's and as a Clone soldier. The Graphics are The Best on the Xbox 360. There's alot of playing variety and entertaining. The voices sound like the actors in the series. Great. It is Loads of Fun start to finish. Look how low you can buy it for now.  What a Deal.  You Won't be sorry. The Force is with this game And Fun...
2,Sad outcome...,"I bought this game for my 8 year old.  She was having so much fun raising her new kitten and then it grew up. After the pet grew up it had to be taken to the pet store! She was SO sad.  So now she knows every animal she gets will have to go away.  So if you are prepared to let your pet go then this game is fine, but if you think you are going to raise your pet and play with it, skip this game!"
5,Best type of Joycons that work better than the Official Nintendo Joycons.,"This is my 3rd set of these types of Joycons. They work much better than the official Nintendo Joycons too. I got my 1st 2 sets from Wish, and ordered this new set here on Amazon, which is the grey ones with red and blue buttons looking similar to the Pokemon themed limited edition Switch Lite, which is why I got them. There is no drift whatsoever and they actually set up easily unlike what happened a year ago with official Neon Pink and Green Nintendo Joycons with the left joycon not registering as part of handheld mode. I get these kinds now because I know they work well. I'm glad I have no trouble with these curved joycons and love them alot! These may not be the official Joycons, but from experience, they're the best to have and are even less expensive than the official ones!"
5,good,was easy to use all worked great
4,Fun and challenging for ALL ages!,"I hope that Amazon uses this review. I won't go into the games and how they work. This was the first PC game of this sort that I've ever tried. I liked the HP movies and books, so I thought I'd give it a try! WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T LOSE THE ID CODE!!!! I cannot stress that strongly enough. If you lose the seeming unimportant scrap of paper found in the jewel box (which is totally empty except for the play disks and this little piece of paper), you're screwed. You need this ID code to install ALL the game disks. I didn't realize the importance of this little piece of paper, and I lost it after I moved my computer desk and all its contents. I had installed the SS and, when I tried to play the Chamber of Secrets, I couldn't believe I had to use the number code to install that game too. I haven't had any luck finding an alternative to entering the code into the other games. This is a great product, you'll enjoy the graphics JUST DON'T LOSE THE ID CODE!!!!"
5,works like a charm on wii once you get settings right,"I bought this to connect my Nintendo Wii to a projector through the VGA port.  It does just that, though it may not be obvious that, to get it to work, you have to first connect the Wii to a regular television (with this cable) and set your screen resolution (in the settings menu) from ""standard tv (480i)"" to ""EDTV or HDTV (480p)."" Once you've done that, you can connect it to whatever VGA input device you'd like and it works like a charm.  I just hooked it up today and haven't noticed any problems so far."
5,If I ever needed another one of these I would order it again from the same place.,"I got the product I ordered, It is in great condition and it works perfectly."
1,Trash,This game is so horrendous  because of the controls. Why the heck does Nintendo always do stuff like this. They ruined the last 2 Zelda games with forced crap motion controls and now they release this game which would be great if you could use the cpp to aim instead of the stylus.  All these fools on here giving the game 5 stars are lying to themselves. This game is the pits no pun intended.
1,DO NOT BUY,"This did not run and I tried several times. You see I didn't listen to the comment before me.....I got the same thing, nothing.....Please do not buy and make the same mistake I did. I hope to get my money back, I hope they fix the problem which is on there end...."
5,Five Stars,It's Doom. No review is needed
2,this is the one I am most disappointed in. I was really hoping that this would ...,"Out of all the sims packs at this point, this is the one I am most disappointed in. I was really hoping that this would be the game pack that would get me back into the sims but nope, instead it broke my heart. I was hoping that in Dine out you could really own your own restaurant, like really own it. Like be the cook and have your children be the wait staff. But no, all you can do is own it and welcome guest. Can't take orders or cook food. You can't even live on the lot with the restaurant. And with the loading times being a problem, it makes the feature of owing a restaurant feel useless. It was more of a chore than a feature. They really let the ball go on this one, I hope feature packs won't be this bad."
5,It's a very good mouse. I used almost the buttons on the ...,It's a very good mouse. I used almost the buttons on the mouse for cs:go. Very great for claw grip types :)
5,Bit Overkill,"Sound is good, lights are fun, but you could get everything out of a single USB cable. You don't need 3 cables for the light, microphone, and headphone all in one."
5,MAKES ASSASSINS CREED LOOK LIKE A CHILDS GAME,"WHATS MORE TO SAY THEN I JUST LOVE THIS GAME? TONS OF VIOLENCE, SPECTACULAR STORYLINE, GOOD GAMEPLAY IN GENERAL. THEY DID AN AWESOME JOB CREATING THIS GAME."
5,Aeon Flux the series on umd,"This is not a game, but a movie series. It is an excellent product, although many extras are cut off due to the format. If you are looking for a travel animated movie set for your psp this is a good one. If looking for the extras buy the dvd."
5,"It's cheap, It works.","I had second thoughts about buying this hard drive for my xbox 360 slim after reading some bad reviews, I ordered it. The day I recived my hard drive it was brand spanking new didnt look any different from microsofts hard drive. Popped it in my xbox and it recognized it , It WORKED! I would highly reccomend this hard drive to anybody. Only downfall is if you like old xbox games you wouldnt be able to play them. But all I play Is 360 so I can careless."
1,One Star,"Immediately as I purchased the digital product, the game crashed."
5,Five Stars,"Works great, exactly like the original sony controller for ps4."
5,Great HOG games relaxed mode,"I have enjoyed all the Samantha Swift games. Everyone can play. The graphics are crisp and colorful not like so many games are. Hidden items are not overly hard to find making the games enjoyable to play over and over again. Yet I still have trouble finding items, lighting bolts, and Swift symbols. I am a senior player with decreasing vision and games which are dark and cluttered are not fun or enteraining to play. Relaxed mode. In The Golden Touch there was a feature that would identify where the item highlighted was. You could choose not to use it but it was there so you did not have to become overly frustrated. I was really sorry they did not continue offering that feature."
5,Funnest Parts Expansion Pack I've Had,"Sim 3 High End Loft and High Tech Stuff is a great parts expansion pack which contains many items for your Sims to interact with, unlike the World Adventures. So far, it is bug-free and easy to install and use. Recommended for Sims 3 players."
1,Horrible Game Period - Do not waste your money - Deserves 0 stars,"I give this game 0 stars - its a piece of garbage and if the game developer had any moral character left they would refund the 70 dollars I wasted on the game. Save your money and do NOT buy this game, I was a Fallout fan before this game. The other thing that really ticks me off is having to sign-up, because I use PS4 for a PS4 Plus account before I can actually use the game. I like to play solo and do not want to be part of the MPG world so why should I be forced into paying additional money before I can play the game that I payed 70 dollars for. Time to break-out Fallout 4 and play what use to be an awesome game...."
1,Unfair,These prices are super redick. No one should give any of these third party people money. That's just unfair
1,One Star,Generic outlast ripoff first person horror game.
1,DON'T BE FOOLED 3RD PARTY REMOTE!!!,This is a complete scam. I bought this controller assuming it was an actual Sony ps3 controller and not some 3rd party crappy one. I paid over 35 for it only to find out that it is in fact a crappy 3rd party remote that barely works at best. From the moment I took it out of the packaging I knew right away it wasn't a Sony  product because the center round button was just black as opposed to the Sony ps3 logo that comes with the real deal. This is false advertising at its best. I've bought the 3rd party remotes for less than half what I paid for this and they've all worked better than this one has. It will only work when it's plugged in and even then more often than not doesn't work all  the time. While connected to the charger it will randomly disconnect itself mid game which is really awesome if you're in the middle of an intense scene. That's if  your lucky enough for it to even turn on at all. If your looking to not spend full price for a Sony  remote I strongly urge you to buy the ones that cost between 10-15 because while they to have their issues it's a much easier pill to swallow if it doesn't work out vs spending what I did to get this garbage. I can't understand how amazon backs a seller like this not to mention it took 3 weeks to get delivered! This is the first review I've ever written and it's only because I'm so incredibly infuriated about this purchase that I'm warning anyone else to stay away from this.
4,Very good product,"Quality seems good so far. Sound is not top notch but you gwt what you pay for. Definitely stylish and entertaining. Cool lighting. Sound quality isn't deminished, but it isn't bose, sony, or beats so..."
5,Updated Design Is Mint,"Wow. So I ordered some expensive, classy Waterfield leather cases but forgot to cancel this order. Showed up on my doorstep the other day. Was planning to return it but after trying it? Oh my goodness this case is mint! Perfect fit, tab to lift out, Velcro holds it in, tons of game slots, and enough room to house portable battery, USB C charger and cable, phone charger and cable for hotspot online, Bose earbuds, tripod for charging in tabletop mode... and the case is actually SMALLER than the Sheika case from the Zelda BotW LE. I love how the middle pads ensure no pressure is applied against the Joycon analogs, even when chock full of accessories. It's black, looks nice, no one knows what's inside. Classy and practical. Well done Butterfox. Well done."
4,Well...It charges things,"Works like it is supposed to.  Had I realized that the switch just needs a general USB type C charger same as a phone charger, I don't think I would have bought this model.  A general-purpose high output USB type C charger works fine and could give more flexibility with additional charging ports as well.  This works fine and as advertised, there are just more versatile options for your money."
1,Is this the best,Sony can come up with. This game is bad looking long winded and boring. Graphics are sub-par and the game lags really bad in areas. Thought my ps4 was supposed to have more power. 1 star out of 5
1,Avoid like a plague,"terrible update. Only play when connected online. No agricultural zones, no subways, only tiny towns possible, terrible transportation choices, cities can't be saved to you're own hard drive. No Macintosh version which was promised. AVOID like the plague.  It's not SimCity anymore."
1,Micro transactions,Stop it stop it. You're ruining a potential classic!
5,"Budget mechanical sound and feel,  great colors!!","Awesome keyboard,  I'm an IT guy by profession and of course having a mechanical keyboard is a must in that envrioment.  The keys sound and feel great,  I'm on 3 months of daily use,  this has made my typing even faster the colors are nice and I've received a lot of compliments on it.  Totally worth it for the price,  only complaint was the enter key placement took a minute to get used to but not a huge deal.  Looking to get another one soon for my personal machine.  Thanks Rii!!"
5,Works great with Duelshock 4 controllers!,"This adapter seems to work great, I can't notice any type of input delay! I tested the adapter with a Dualshock 4 controller by playing Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Enter the Gungeon. Needless to say it worked just like an official Nintendo controller would. I had quite the struggle figuring out how to use the adapter though. Most of the problems were my fault but I was unaware that you must enable wired controller connection in controller settings in order to use this adapter. 8Bitdo mention this on their website but not on the box. No matter how hard I tried though I just can't seem to get my Xbox One controller to work with it. I went on the 8Bitdo website and downloaded the latest firmware and that still didn't solve my problem. I know some of the older Xbox One controllers do not have bluetooth capability in them but mine does, that was the sole purpose I bought the controller (I wanted to controller to use on my PC). It's probably something I'm doing wrong but at least it works with my DualShock 4 controller. I recommend this product!"
2,With the budget Activision has you would expect more,"Unfortunately another miss.  I think Battlefield 1 has ruined me from COD.  Not as horrible as the last two but not great, MP is mediocre with unimaginative maps.  Launch day a joke, nothing but server errors.  Guess back to Battlefield 1, a real quality FPS with depth.  I was hoping for the best but probably won't play this much as Bf1 expansions have been so good."
2,worst mario party game ever,"i am a huge fan of all mario party games for any platform, whether ds, wii, or game cube. i had high hopes for this game since it is for the new 3DS and i thought that it would blow all the other mario party games away. It did not. In fact, it fell behind as one of the worst mario party games i have ever played. The normal DS game for Mario Party is 10X better than this one. The only thing good about it is the 3D modes. You can not play all of the game boards, namely the last one where you need to have 3-4 actual players and not COMs. The boardgames last no more than 30-40 minutes and go by faster than a mario kart race on rainbow road. Most of the games are the same as past generation minigames, but with a litle twist, but too little to actually enjoy. Some minigames require the movement of the DS itself, and that is where the annoyance kicks in. The balance usually always go off and you end up turning your whole body in circles to move your screen to the right direction. there are less character choices in this game than the last, and there is no plot. You have to deal with tutorials all through out the game, and the minigames are short as well. I am very sad about this game and disappointed in the makings of it. i hope this helps you decide whether or not you buy this or not. My advice, if you want a better mario party, choose mario party DS for regular DS."
5,Please with the headphones,I originally had give this headphone an ok review because of how uncomfortable it was for my son.  Shortly after almost a year after I purchased the headset they replaced the headphones and we are very pleased with the replacement.  Thank you so much for caring so much on how your customers feel about your products.
1,"Keyboard forgets profile, goes back to default","Will not remember light sync settings, software shows correct profile and keyboard is recognized, but reverts to rainbow with cycling animation. Not worth 250.00 dollars when it can't control the RGB when wireless."
5,Amazing.,"I am so happy Persona is on switch now!! This game is so far really good, and the quality of the game is so much better than I expected. I look forward to completing the game! I love that it came with a code for bonus content, really nice to have."
1,scalpers taking advantage of the pandemic,This form of scalping should not be allowed during a pandemic.
5,Arrived on time and my grandson is happy he can now charge and play without the docking ...,Arrived on time and my grandson is happy he can now charge and play without the docking station. Great seller and will buy from again!
2,A Little Disappointed,"I was looking forward to this expansion pack, but was disappointed.  Like the previous reviews have said you can't go into town like you could with the Sims 2.  I do not like the apartments or town home.  Once your Sims become famous, don't even think about them moving into a mansion, no lot large enough in Bridgeport. I edit the town that I have been playing and added a couple of the hang out places so my Sims will have a place to go without me starting over.  It is sad that Sims 2, which is an older game is a lot more fun playing than Sims 3.  EA, ""this is for you"", give us some of the expansion pack like the Sims 2."
1,A disaster for local multi-player,No guidance that the second player can do nothing if the first player does but push the game forward.
5,Works great with Note 4!,I was able to fit my Note 4 snugly with the S case on the phone.  Works perfectly and positions just fine. Not wobbly but I would be gentle because it is plastic. Now I can stream my PS4 thru wifi and 4G and with the PS4 controller!
1,Wait two months and the price will be correct,Dont buy this game now even if its a great game the cost is a reach for the industry. If we let them get away with charging this much the rest of the developers will follow and pc gaming will trully die. Wait two months and the lack of sales will cause a price adjustment and you will beable to purchase it on amazon for 39.00. Better yet wait a year and you will beable to buy the full game with all three campaigns.
2,False Advertisement,"When I ordered this, I was told by the description of the product that it worked with many different games in the Rock Band and Guitar Hero series. However, upon testing it myself, I turns out I got a drum set that only works on Rock Band: Beetles and any other game that came after. Meaning, not only was I misinformed, but now I was extremely limited to what games I could actually use it on."
1,Was working,Well got it on launch day. Suffered a few random turn offs. Ended up putting 30 hours into ac valhalla and then boom. The series x shut down and won't turn back on. Looks like this is an issue with quite a few of them.
2,It's all Bad...,"Bad graphics, Bad textures, Bad costumes, Bad online play, Bad animations, Bad use of the Unreal 4 engine, Bad story mode, even worse side story mode."
5,Great,Works perfect for me!
5,One of my favorite games of all time!,"I can't say enough good things about Ghost of Tsushima. The combat is fun, the world is gorgeous, the story goes in places you won't see coming. It's one of my favorite games of all time!"
1,G920 IS NOT FOR PC!!!,"I can't believe Logitech STILL has not come up with proper PC drivers for this wheel!  They are quick to blame game companies for not supporting this wheel, but they wouldn't have to if Logitech would follow some sort of, I don't know, CONVENTION??? Come on, Logitech... how many years will it be before you discover game consoles and Windows personal computers are two different things?  I should have read the one star reviews more carefully, as this is a KNOWN ISSUE.  Pedal assignments are wrong and button assignments are backwards in NFS 2016.  For F1 2017, the wheel is only recognized part of the time.  I only bought this thing because the clamps on my Logitech G25 wheel finally gave out after 10 years or so.  This G920 is going back. I will do more research before buying another game console device ""that also works on PC"".  Oh, yeah... two other things.  Good luck cranking this wheel more than a half turn; the lower flat spot will make you loose grip.  The other thing, is the stupid, ultra bright, white LED by the X-Box button.  I covered it with three layers of blue painter's tape to be able to see it without blinding me.  Anyway, now I understand why USED G25 and G27 wheels sell for MUCH more than these new pieces of junk.  Logitech just lost my business... permanently.  And Amazon?  You guys should know better, and probably would if you actually read these reviews."
5,Great system...,"Purchased for grandson who plays with it everyday, but only after completing his homework.  He's trying to teach his younger brother how to play."
1,love the game but couldn't get the demo to work.,I couldn't get the demo to work. I played the game on a friends pc and it was so creepy that it was great. I would buy the game on steam those.
5,Quality replacement for your overpriced elite 2 controller,They seem to be the same quality or better than the original buttons that come with the elite 2 controller. Fit perfect and look great! Would order again!
1,Broke after a half hour,"I was very disappointed, I bought this as a Christmas gift for someone and it stopped working after about a half hour of us using it. It smells like something burned inside it. I had high hopes after watching a positive review for it online, I really was hoping this thing would be good."
5,Sims Castaway Taken Away,"I finally broke down and bought the Nintendo DS, even though my husband had no interest in it.  He has a PSP that he really likes and I figured I'd play the DS while he has his PSP. I bought the Sims Castaway for the DS because I'm a huge fan of the Sims and the Sims 2.  I started playing it and I couldn't even really get started without my husband looking over my shoulder, wanting to play it.  I finally turned around and let him play...BIG MISTAKE...He had my DS for over 4 hours, playing the Sims Castaway.  Luckily for me, he works today so I can have the game to myself for a couple hours.  Based upon my initial playing, and how my hubby couldn't put it down...I rated this game very well.  It deems very addictive!  They really should start a Sims addiction hotline!!!"
5,A Grand Hack-n-Slash Adventure,"I love this game for what it does well.  It is a wonderful single-player hack-n-slash adventure set in a creative and vibrant world with mythical overtones.  However, I must caution you.  This is not Diablo III.  This game is not really meant to be a multiplayer game.  It is a single-player game with the multiplayer option.  It handles multiplayer much like Sacred did by matchmaking you with those who host a server.  There is no central Battle.net service here, and the multiplayer suffers because of it.  Plus, this is a very linear game.  Also, the game doesn't offer anything new to the genre that hasn't been done previously.  But, it does borrow some of the best elements of gold standards in the industry like Diablo II, Sacred, and Dungeon Siege.  The true strength of the game is the skill and character sets.  There are so many ways you can develop a character and, in turn, so many ways you can choose to approach the gameplay.  Helping our character grow and choosing the path is a lot of fun.  I presently have 4 different characters I'm playing - each with a unique style of play that makes the gaming experience different.  The graphics and sound are wonderful and what you would expect from contemporary games.  In conclusion, if you are looking for a multiplayer experience like you had with Diablo II, this is not the game for you.  If you want a fun and beautiful single-player game along the lines of Sacred and Dungeon Siege, Titan Quest is well worth the money.  I've been unhappy with many of the games I've bought so far this year - I'm not unhappy with this one.  Jump in and have a blast!"
1,READ BEFORE BUYING!!!,"This wrap looks great in the picture and in the package. You should know that its cut from a flat sheet of sticker which does not transfer well to the curves of the controller. I have wrinkles and air bubbles across many curves, especially around the thumbsticks. The measurements are also off by a tiny amount so the skin around the buttons wont fit perfectly leading to the circle button sticking. Do NOT buy this product. I will be attempting a refund if possible"
5,A breath of fresh air,"I got this for my nine year olds birthday. It was a slow start because she tried to  play it without reading the directions and quickly became frustrated. The horse wasn't responding the way that it was supposed to. After scolding her and insisting I wasn't going to help her, it turns out that we didn't have any batteries in the balance board, oops. And the the rechargeables in the remote weren't  charged enough. After she happily figured this out on her own, her momentum increased and she's been playing for about 2 hours now (hey it's a Friday). She takes riding lessons and isn't at galloping yet so this is a creative outlet for her. I asked her what she liked best about the game and she said the races and how the graphics were good. And what she liked least, and she said having to read the directions.lol. I'm sure this game has a lot more stimulating capabilities but it should last her a good while having to figure them all out. I consider this game a breath of fresh air because horse games in the States are crap. She's been through all of the girlie ""Barbie"" type horse games a couple of times. She'll play them, trade them in, miss them and have to re-buy them from GameStop. I know, waste of money(hers) but better to let her learn this now then when she's thirty. And I've only let her do that twice. Europe has awesome horse games based on what we've seen on You Tube. I wish we has access to those."
5,Beware of fake reviews. Look for verified purchases only.,Awesome console. Has some quirks but I'm sure MS will iron those out in good time. Fun games and cutting edge UI features put this miles ahead of the competitor.
5,PLAY THE GAME FIRST THEN WRITE A REVIEW,I have no idea where the reviews are coming from. The game wont be out for another month yet people are giving it two stars??? Madden is yet to make a bad game. SO GIVE IT A CHANCE!!!!
1,is a good game but you'are wasting money treasure trove has the ...,"is a good game but you'are wasting money treasure trove has the full game, including this one so if you want to have all the games of the siries don't buy this one buy directly treasure trove  or you would have to pay twice for this game."
5,Highly recommend and not hard to install at all,This was a great value and very easy to install I did watch a couple YouTube videos before attempting to switch them out but ended up taking less than 20 mins to fix both controls on our sons switch. Would recommend and great value. Plus was awesome to have the extra parts if needed and tools to be able to do the job!
5,Great game,"I think I like this game better than the regular wii game. Really. It is so fun and there are many different editions, I love the chipmunk suit the best....or is it a flying squirrel...anyway its fun."
5,Hell'a fun!,"The most satanic fun you can have without a Ouija board and a basement of virgins! Plus it is a lot less messy. Great for the whole family, Manson or otherwise."
5,Works with DDR2,"This is the exact same mat that ships with DDR2.  We haven't tried any 3rd party mats, so I can't comment on that.  This one worked fine right out of the box and has had no problems.  If you are considering another mat, definitely go for it.  It brings a whole new level of fun to the game!"
5,Blows 2K out the water,Blows 2K out of the water. I used to be a 2K guy but 2K18 feels the same and this is a step up. Check it out!
5,I'm having fun lots of it,The animations are a little wonky at times but I like the story so far the game play is on point and I'm having lots of fun... I'm having more fun with this than I am with horizon zero dawn
5,Great value for the price,I got this for my grandson when he got a Nintendo Switch.  He loved it.  The case has everything you need to get started.
5,"Inexpensive, does the job","I couldn't find my regular camera protectors available from the manufacturer yet, so I bought these.  They apply like they should, and seem to do the job without negatively affecting the photo quality on my iPhone 13 Pro. A package of three for the price they're offering is a bargain."
5,Buy this Great product fron Nintendo!,"This is  the BEST Nintendo product I have every had or owned!! I mean every! Out of all their systems! Great value,customer service and total relyablity! And product service and its total all over functions! It's great and I total recommend it to get from Amazon!! You will very much love its uses! And all over fun!"
1,SWEET!,"Good console, I'm gonna give it a one start though because why not?"
5,Looks good and installs in minutes.,Highly recommend. It went up easy and keeps my PS4 out of reach from my 1 year old and looks good.
1,Buyer beware.  Product uses a foreign plug,Buyer beware!  This item was for a foreign country.  They plug is not made for USA.  Very disappointed to find this out on Christmas morning when trying to use
1,Don't reward scalping,Don't reward scalping
1,No online co op with friends play,They forgot to leave out this detail conveniently
1,Buyer beware!!! Not fortnite compatible.,Does not work with an iPhone. Does not work with Android. The app you must have to use this controller no longer exsists. This will not work with Fortnite mobile. The product requires and app that no longer exists (as of 8-10-2018). Is not compatible with any device.
4,Just received and the 8 yr old likes it.,Just received and  the 8 yr old likes it.
1,Multiplayer only title.,The game feels like a modded version of Call of Duty - fun for awhile but ultimately it just feels like more of something that went stale for me a long time ago. The lack of a single player campaign hurts the value. This should be sold for 30 bucks as it isn't worth paying full price for.
2,Why did they have to add occult garbage?,"I just got this game for Christmas and I really enjoy the doctor role-play.  The surgeries and healing the patients are a lot of fun.  But my biggest complaint is why did they have to add ""The Healing Touch""?  Dr. Vaughn is asked within the first couple of surgeries if he's still doing his ""witch-craft"" and meditating.  The fourth tutorial you are taught to draw a pentagram as the ""healing touch"".  I haven't had to use it, but occasionally the pentagram flashes as ""the healing touch"" and allows you to have extra time to perform your surgery.  I am quite offended that the makers of this game think medicine can't be performed successfully without witch-craft involved.  Make a medicine game without the pentagrams and I'll give it 5 stars."
1,DLC code doesn't work U.S,"This isn't the US version so if you're buying from America don't waste your money. The DLC code doesn't work here, the game I received was a U.K. region version."
5,Great board,I love everything about this board. Super clicky.
4,Better Than The Original ARMY OF TWO,"Although, I haven't had this very long but, from what I've played is extremely satisfying this game rocks.  I love the weaponry and cutscenes and dialogue already in this game.  The storymode so far in this is interesting, that gives it great single and co-op play, the AGGRO system in here very sharp and pleasing, you should love faking surrenders and faking death in a hard place,the graphicss are good but not as good as MW2.  This game does however bring back something I love which is BDA (bullet damage action) if you're using the right weapon and give someone a headshot you blow their head off, which really makes a shooter worthy of M ratings. I played all of the online multiplayer modes and they're all great, they strongly enforce teamwork which is what this type of game is all about.  Oh yeah cannot forget about the weapon and mask and armor customization I designed my mask and armor and they're just what I expected them to be you should be pleased too. Now for my ratings STORYMODE 5stars, GAMEPLAY 4stars, GRAPHICS 4STARS, MULTIPLAYER 3stars and CO-OP 5stars. This one kick-ass game you won't regret.  ARMY OF TWO: THE 40th DAY 4stars"
1,play if u wanna break your controller,Very difficult game . If you are glutton for punishment play at your own risk minus 5 stars
5,Does as it claims.,"I was in the market for a dock that would allow me to charge my PlayStation Move controller(s) without needing to use a USB cable. The main reason for this is that I'm not a big fan of leaving my PlayStation 3 on or charging this via a laptop or cable box. After checking out several docks, I decided to go with the one created by Sony. I realize other docks charge more controllers at once, but in my opinion, nothing beats out a first party accessory. This item doesn't overcharge the controllers at all and allows me to use my Move controllers whenever I want without worrying about the battery. I would recommend this to anyone whom is considering a dock for their Move controllers."
1,Disappointed,"I was super excited to buy this, and I was very pleased that it came early. The product description says that I get the console, the stylus, six AR cards, etc. The only things that came within the package were the console and the adapter. Not only that, but I learned that the console froze up the minute I opened it. I turned it off and on again, made sure it was charged, and it still won't let me get past the first screen. Very unhappy for buying a ""very good"" used 3DS that doesn't work at all. I want my money back."
2,"I bought this game, but after looking at character ...","I bought this game, but after looking at character creation I don't know if I want to play it.  What was Bioware thinking? Is there a producer on this thing?  This looks old to say the least. Outdated... a step backwards!"
5,Sensational,Exceeded my expectations. More relaxed and forgiving than other soulsborne games. If you're not playing this game RIGHT NOW what are you even doing?
5,Microsoft Train Simulator,"This is the best, by far, simulation of train operations.  I am a RR professional, and have to say, the realism here is incredibly solid along with great sound and graphics.  I hope this program will bring on generations of add-ons like FS2000.  If you don't appreciate Railroading, you will still be amazed at the detail and replay value of this program."
5,"Granddaughter loves the headset, say it is perfect.",Great headset
5,Wonderful game!,"First off, this game is amazing. Great setting, story, and characters, and it feels a lot like the older games, especially the Ezio trilogy. There's a few one star reviews on here that are just plain unfair. A few of them obviously didn't even play the game and the rest just seem to be hating on it just to hate. So just ignore them. They're just trolls messing up the rating. Syndicate is a great game and I would definitely recommend it. :)"
5,Item as described!,Great product!
1,Bait and Switch,"I did not receive the pictured item.  I received the game ONLY without case, music, map, etc.  I likely will be returning this item.  BEWARE."
5,Gamer for Life,"Pulled out the PS3 after my PS4 died. Didn't realize the PS4 remote only worked wired for the PS3. Bought this to get back gaming, charged it and went to work! Nothing like getting back in the game!"
5,Great controller.,Excellent controller. My original ps4 controller broke and I didn't want to spend a ton on a new one. I started looking for other options and came across this store. I decided to purchase this controller and I'm glad I did. It works just as good as the original. I also purchased a Nintendo Switch controller and it works great as well.
5,Perfect - enough said,I set this up in another room in the house and it works like it should.  Perfect - enough said.
5,Happy is the player with no internet search history.,"Hello there! What a lovely day it is. Have you heard about the new game We Happy Few? Of course you have! Otherwise you wouldn't be looking this over, right? Well let me parlay the basics. This complete gem of a game will probably be the absolute best thing to happen to you since your spouse, assuming it's a happy marriage. Imagine a survival horror post apocalyptic fever dream clockwork orange Alice in wonderland spectacular Orwellian dystopian utopia! Or whatever else comes to mind when you read those things. That's what this game is. Try to survive in a fantastic futuristic British town, area, place, while trying to discover what happened to your brother. Or don't. Take your joy and forget everything. That's always a valid option too."
1,Way overpriced,Extremely overpriced
1,Servers are a joke,"For a game that costs 60 dollars, you think they would make the servers so you can play online. I bought this specifically to play with my wife online, and I can't even do that because all I get when I go to the Co-op and Multiplayer links is cannot connect to EA server. The beta was more fun. I love the game play but they are so cheap with servers the rest of the nice is pointless. It is like, a girl that is really hot but has AIDS. Great to look at but you can't do anything with it. Thanks for AIDS EA!"
1,Missing preorder bonus,Didn't recieve the pins that were supposed to come with physical day one edition copies.
5,my favorite Mario on the NES,"While many consider this the black sheep of the Super Mario Bros series on the NES, this game is actually my favorite on the bunch.  The world is nothing like the world of the other Mario games, and the enemies and bosses and goal is different.  This is a quest to defeat Boss Wart (instead of Bowser) and you have the options of playing as one of four characters (with the ability to switch every level): Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Toad.  Each of these characters have different play characteristics.  Toad can pick up any object with no difficulty but is the worst jumper.  Princess is the opposite (no strength, but can float).  Luigi has the best jump (no float), but that becomes its own problem.  Mario is perfectly average.  These strengths and weaknesses come into play in choosing who to use for each level and some are clearly better than others on any given level. Even though I found this game to be the easiest of the bunch, for me it was also the most fun.  This is still a side-scrolling game, but some levels scroll up and down on the screen (keeping the side-scrolling viewpoint, though) depending on if you are climbing or dropping down.  There are shortcuts in many levels and different ways to warp, get extra lives (including an odd cheat for extra lives), or to shorten the game.  In the end, there are a couple of difficult levels, but this may be the easiest of the three on the NES.  Even so, this is my favorite of all of the Super Mario games on the NES."
1,"If you already have the game, don't waste your money!!","I love the game in general but the game of the year edition is a waste of money if you already have the game. I ordered it specifically because I don't have an Internet connection for my PS4 to download the DLCs, and can't currently get one where I live, or I would have gotten them before now. That I spent money to basically repurchase the game, as well as express international shipping, and ended up in exactly the same situation I was before, is beyond disappointing to say the least. The least they could have done was put it in the description that the content was not included in the disc and we would only receive a code. That they didn't seems awfully underhanded to me."
1,Poor Quality,"This starter pack is very poor quality and I will be sending it back.  The DSi doesn't really fit well in the case.  The charging stand charged the DSi with about 5 minutes of run-time after being on the stand all night.  Seemed like it was a good value, but not for the quality."
5,Wii game worth the purchase,"You sweat with the game while having tons of fun.  It is about the most active game I have played ever.  My son loves it and he is getting exercise at the same time.  I am not kidding, your muscles will ache.  I thought I was fit completing a half-marathon, but this game brings on sweat and pain within minutes- but it is fun!!!!!!  Every parent should have one.  I am getting another one for my nephews for Christmas."
1,sounds like a robot is eating my disc,"Insert disc and makes a grinding sound, screen displays error on screen for disc failure. Looked forward to proving my older brother wrong about xbox and now I'm the one who, as he says ""listen to your elders"", as he's laughing and enjoying his ps4."
5,The best Wii game!,"I just have to say that I'm so glad I bought this game for my kids (6 and 8, girl and boy). The first day they got it (Saturday) hey danced for 6 hours! They only took breaks when I forced them to eat and drink some water, and then stopped when they finally collapsed from so much exercise. Since then (2 weeks), they have played it regularly for a few hours each day (when allowed). When their friends come it is really fun cause they can play even without the remotes. I love it because it gets them moving and sweating instead of just sitting shooting stuff. The dances are very PG rated.  No weird sexy moves here! The song selections are pretty varied and most are popular, though some are from the eighties, which my husband and I enjoyed.  An awesome game for Wii!"
1,Doesn't work.,The system won't even boot up. Just a pulsing blue light. Amazon is replacing it but its my birthday and I'm SOL for now. Thanks a bunch Sony.
5,Five Stars,"Unlocks all arenas, characters, attires. Before I bought I didn't really trust buying codes online but these really work"
5,"Mojo means magic, and magic is what this game's got....","If you are looking for immersion into a strange and mystical world where the bizarre and the surreal combine with the best elements of gameplay and story-telling, look no further. Bad Mojo does what a good novel or powerful movie does: it sucks you in and holds you there. Graphically it's beautiful. The game play is challenging but not maddening. And there is story here (albeit campy), and character (somewhat cliche). There's no way you have ever played a game like this before. Remember MYST? Well what if MYST was faster paced, less enigmatic and more of a game? Mojo is like MYST except without all the long, dry, boring elements. I can't believe this game was originally released in 1995. It still holds up, and in fact surpasses many 'modern' games. And the bonus features on the DVD are so cool. I am buying several copies for my friends. I never thought I'd like a game in which a cockroach becomes the main character. And I was right, I don't like it. I love it."
5,Perfect case,"You don't need to keep looking. This case has it all: many many slots for physical games, a small pad that keeps the Switch in place AND protects the screen, the zipper does NOT scratch the Switch, everything fits perfectly when you close it and it has a nifty compartment sealed with a zipper that is very useful for keeping stuff like the charger or the joycon grips. It's not a soft case nor is it hard like metal, but it's built so that nothing can smush your gear. I've traveled many times since I purchased it and my Switch is still intact, even though I carry it in the case inside my constantly-moving travel backpack. Can't believe something of this quality is at such a great price."
1,No Digital Copy of Ace Combat 6,The listing on Amazon said this game comes with a digital copy of Ace Combat 6; Mine did not.
1,nope,nope
5,Perfect Timing,"Im happy with this game (got mine on xbox 360). What more could I ask for? Its very strange game (SH3) I never got past the music shop with the door, years ago. So now I finally am progressing, I feel like Im already trapped in Silent Hill and nothing can take me out. The trailer was amazing too. I feel heavy. Its just so real. Definitely use the original voices from 2, they are perfect, regardless of what others say.  Well, I see the graphics look smoother, but, I feel dark all around me in this room, what is going on, well Back to playing Silent Hill. Im ok"
2,Not Compatable with Udraw,"We bought the Drawsome from Amazon and because it said people who buy this item also buy UDraw games...we assumed that these games were compatable...we were wrong.  I also thought that because Drawsome was a Wii Tablet that we would be able to play the Udraw Wii games.  But we got UDraw Pictionary in our machine before we found out that it was not compatable.  I think the 2 games that come with this tablet are the only games that are available for this tablet which was disappointing to my daughter.  On the bright side, we did enjoy the two games that came with this tablet especially Sketch Quest.  I just feel that having two tablets that do not have compatable games is tricky and it was not stated anywhere that these games can not be used with this tablet.  It was even more confusing that amazon recommended the UDraw games to be purchased with this tablet!"
5,Great for weak hands,"Big help for weak hands. Unlike most buyers I have weak and arthritic hands. I found myself quickly irritating my thumbs with a standard controller, having to use too much force, which made accuracy worse.  These Vortex attachments really help.  After some time getting used to them, I can say that I use far less force and can play longer, and my accuracy is much better especially in Destiny 2.  The height increase on the left control is enough to provide increased leverage, so force needed goes down. The tall right controller seemed too much at first but after several hours of gameplay it proves itself an ingenious device. I would never want to go back to standard height controls."
5,Purchase the Wii U version,I played only the Xbox an Wii U versions but out of the two the Wii U version was the best. It has better graphics an the controls felt very smooth. There was an update also on day one to eliminate the frame rate stuttering during cut scenes which I haven't noticed any slowdown yet. No offense to the Wii U I love mine and I have all three consoles but the game selection is pretty bad. If you do have multi consoles though an the Wii U is one of them this is your best bet to purchase it on the Wii and lets hope more great games like this will release on it this year.
1,One Star,Christmas? It's crazy.
5,An outstanding Kinect game with fun controls,This is my fifth Kinect title and is by far the best yet.  The controls are very accurate and game play is lots of fun for my entire family.  The half pipe event and big air events are fun and spur on lots of competition.  Performing different combinations of tricks while in the air and landing them for points is well done.  I'm impressed with the two player split screen options (easy to track where your play space is defined) and the kinect tracking seems to be flawless.  This has been more fun than Kinect Sports for my family.
4,Works Fine,"This drives worked fine.  IT does not allow the unit to play old XBOX games without extra data.  So, if you want to play old xbox games, buy a real Microsoft drive or check out Youtube and find out how to modify this one to do it."
4,Too short and two don't work together,This is the only cable that will work with the XBox 360 S Kinect package. You cannot use any other off-brand USB cable (I've tried).  So if you bought a XBox package with the Kinext sensor included you will need this cable.  The cable works great but it's too short (9ft).  I tried to order two and daisy chain them together but it didn't work.  So unfortunately my Kinect sensor bar has to always be with 16ft of the console. Bad situtation for a home theater.  Thought I would pass along the info so others don't learn the hard way.
1,ONLY FOR WII NOT WII U?!?,"My boss ordered a copy for work and I was so frustrated when using it to realize it was for the Wii not the Wii U. I thought he was trying to save money and immediately got on Amazon and ordered what I thought were 2 copies for the Wii U. One for work and one for home. When I took them out of the package I was so mad to see Wii games. Why in the H E double hockey sticks would Nintendo release a brand new game for only the Switch and the Wii, but not the Wii U?! I could maybe understand if they decided not to make anything but Switch games, but why Wii??? The menu and navigation of the game for the Wii is a pain in the butt and the graphics are terrible! Not even worth it. I returned both copies and I won't be buying more."
5,It's colorful,I like it
1,This launch stinks,"Wow, it is so disheartening to receive a system that doesn't work right out of the box. Seriously, I can't even get the system to display on the screen and the blue light on top of the console keeps flashing. Now my only options are to return it to Sony and have them replace the parts-but to do that I have to sit on their customer service lines for 2 hours and then wait a month to get my console back- OR return it to Amazon without a replacement, only a refund. In either case, what was the point of me preordering the console way back in June. To make it worse, I also bought 6 PS4 games and removed the shrink wrapping without ever even considering this would happen. I had been looking forward to this day for months and the excitement over this week leading up to today was unbelievable, but in the end I was letdown more than I ever have been with something that was not family related."
1,Defective... Twice,This guitar was defective within the first day.  The buttons on the guitar throat became extremely difficult to press.  Got a replacement through Amazon and on the second guitar both the strummer became defective and the same button problem occurred on the second day of use.  This product is defective...
4,"Great game, but no Madden","EA Sports did a good job with this game but it could have been better.  First some positives...the game is very realistic. It has real boxers, cornermen, and referees. The game has fighters in every weight-class including the women.  The punches need to be timed and you just cannot go into the ring versus a good opponent and start pushing buttons.  The crowd looks good and the graphics are terrific.  The movement of the boxers is also realistic.  There are different fighting modes and levels of play.  The easy is way to easy, and the normal gets too easy after you become powerful in the career mode.  The fight commentators are good and they don't repeat themselves like in Madden. Now the negatives...Why does EA allow you to beat this game in the career mode?  I had a record of 23-2 and was able to beat the game.  Like Madden, you should be able to box until you want to retire.  All the great boxers have at least 50 wins and you are forced to retire after 23.  The game should not end so soon.  Also in the career mode, none of the other fighters' record changes but yours.  It seems as though you are the only one fighting.  They should have it so you schedule your fights and the other fighters win and lose as time goes on and everyone gets reranked, so it is harder to climb to the top.  Even after you beat someone the loss does not go on his record.  Also, in the career mode, you become too powerful too quickly.  You are given training points after you train between fights.  The training points determine how good of a fighter you are by determining things such as your speed, quickness, stamina, recovery time, ease to cut, etc.  However, the training points are too easy to get and too many are given out at once.  I had 100 in every category my 2nd to last fight, and I was invincible.  You should have to fight some fighters twice so you can get more victories and you become powerful slowly.  After you move up in ranking, you cannot rechallenge anyone lower than you, even if you had a close fight.  An annoying part of the game is that the announcers and referee mouth does not move as they talk.  Also the ref is not in the ring as you box, you just hear a voice. Also walking out you don't have a robe on and there is no one around you. A huge mistake in the game is the training mode.  Your sparring partner cannot hit you with the hook, so you are unable to block it.  Also it is nearly impossible to throw the cross, low hook combination.  You lose training points because you are unable to do certain things in training mode and the computer doesn't recognize that it is making the mistake.  And the main reason why I give the game 4 stars is lack of button recognition. Sometimes the game does not recognize the buttons you push, especially when you have to push 2 buttons at once.  All in all, I think it is the second best title for PS2, but far behind Madden.  I think it is defintely something you should buy, but EA has to make some improvements.  And for the person who said Ready 2 Rumble 2 is more realistic, are you kidding me?  No one should ever listen to that person's opinions about games.  KO Kings is based on realism.  Ready 2 Rumble is supposed to be fun and comical, not realistic.  And that is what it accomplishes.  Again, I would recommend that you buy the game, it is a good one for a serious gamer who likes realistic sport games.  And for those of you looking for some tips.  The secret to be successful against a good opponent focus on hitting the body.  Use your jabs and crosses in the first few rounds to the body.  You will notice that when you hit him in the stomach during later rounds he stops to cover up.  This is when you let lose to his head by throwing you specialty punch or strong upper combination.  In the 7th and 8th rounds you can hit him in the body and it takes away a lot of power and sets up the knock out. Or if the fighter's cut rating is low, circle and jab and double-jab to the face.  By the 3rd round you should have him opened up and you can focus on landing combinations and jabs to the eye so the doctor stops the fight.  What not to do...don't go in the ring trying to throw a bunch of uppercuts and knockout blows, good fighter will eat you alive.  Set up combinatins with the jab and blocking shots.  The best way to knock someone out is going to the body and when he covers up go the head.  The combinations starting at the body and working up is effective while the boxer is in the corner.  You should always keep the person against the ropes, by standing back and just throwing jabs to the face, and follow up with combinations to the body when he covers. To beat the game you must learn how to defend yourself.  Use L1 and L2 a lot. If you slip by a punch you have time to throw a jab and combination, but watch out for combinations, you don't want to let go of the L buttons too early and get caught with the follow up punch. And d_critique opinion is always reliable."
5,For some reason I bought a console,Works with no problems as of yet after 2 months. The refurb was in excellent quality almost as if it were brand new.
5,It's Awsome!!!!!!!!,"This  is one of my favorite games. You can go in space ships of all kinds. I realy like Darth Vader's tie fighter (I know his ship sucks, but I've always liked ties). You can also unlock new kinds of ships like the X-wing and Slave 1. Besides those two there are many many more. The misson mode is realy fun also. I like the way how you can use the touch screen to do super moves. There are also many force moves you can use. The best part about the single player is slashing your enimies with your lightsaber and then using force moves to finish them off. If you are a nintendo and star wars fan I reccomend you get this game. And one more thing, PSP sucks. The NINTENDO DAUL SCREEN (or DS) rocks dis house. All the people who said this game is a 4 star or higher are very COOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DYLAN"
1,Code didn't work......buyers beware of JFJ,"Sold by JFJ.....didn't work! Buyer beware! I'm attempting a return now, let's see if I get a refund."
1,"The worst game yet for the Wii, avoid","Anubis II has a budget price for a reason.  This is above all the worst game to see the light of day for the Wii yet, thanks to it's unresponsive controls, ugly visuals, boring gameplay, and a grating soundtrack all combine to help Anubis II claim the aforementioned title.  You play as the savior of ancient Egypt, or something, in what would otherwise be called a platformer.  As anyone who has played a video game in their life will know, jumping is key to any platformer, which Anubis II attempts to use with the Wii-mote and nunchuk, and this is where the game fails the most.  Raising up the nunchuk barely works (and in some cases, it just doesn't), while the tedious combat illustrates the game's broken controls and boring gameplay all the more thanks to just plain bad movement.  As far as the game's graphics go, the Wii is far from a technical powerhouse, but Anubis II looks like it was emulated from a first generation PS1 platformer.  In case you haven't gotten the idea yet, Anubis II is by far and large the worst game to hit the Wii yet, and should be avoided at all costs."
5,Worth it so far,"So far, so good. Wanted something to keep my wireless USB headphones safe, this does the trick. USB ports built in are definitely an added bonus. It makes leaving things ready for my laptop, nice and easy. RGB lighting adds a fun touch."
4,Other reviews are out of date,"The biggest complaint from the other reviews is the DRM. The DRM has changed since then. When this game first came out, you can only install this game three times one one machine, and that's it. That's why everyone was upset about it, and they had the right, I was upset as well. But it's changed now. The DRM is still there, but it's not a bother anymore. It restricts you to 3 installs per month. After a month, those 3 installs reset.  Unless you love uninstalling your games every week, I doubt 3 installs per month will be a hassle for you."
5,I Cant Explain It!,"Is there nicotine in video games now? This is the masterpeice of video game making. The game rating from 1-5 is a 10. The realism this game is unexplainable, it steals your weekends, it will become your new best friend. Rome: Total War is the third Total War game in the series after Medieval: Total War, which was good but the graphics were corny, and the fighting was unrealistic. Rome: Total War was a huge step from Medieval: Total War, Rome TW's graphics are outstanding, the cities make you feel as if you are a citizen of them, and the battles are addicting and action packed. If i had to bring two things to a stranded island with me, id bring mty computer and my best friend named RTW."
1,DOA - Defective Console - Blue Light of Death,"My son worked this summer to be able to buy this console and pre-ordered it in August. After a three month wait - the unit he received did not work - at all. The unit would not turn on - only a blue pulsing light - never changed to white - no video. I tried calling Sony - but never got through - both calls being dropped, once after 90 minutes on hold and the other after 36 minutes on hold. Ended up calling Amazon to return for a refund. Very disappointing."
1,Anger and frustration!,"I had a crappy work week. Excited to enjoy weekend with arrival of PS4...instead freakin pissed that it don't want to load up. Stays at the blue pulsating light...I waited since launch announcement for this and finally want to enjoy...instead I have to return to Amazon and basically wait like everyone else for new stock...and even then not sure if the system will work. What is purpose of preorder when u wind up having to go from front of line to the back of the line. Will get my money back and then just sit back and see if Sony can get act together or if Xbox One is the way to go. Either way, stressed, pissed and bored."
5,great game,My son loves this game
5,"Very Nice, All in one controller charger and Nintendo Switch holder.","This is a very nice dock and charger station for the nintendo switch. It even hold a some game cases. The Joy-Cons and pro controllers have a dedicated slot for charging the poke ball controller do not. Overall it's a very nice only thing I wish they would of done is place the power port on the back of the dock instead of the front. It's not that big a deal, but when your trying to hide wires it makes it a little harder."
2,new slim ps2,"I dont see the point in this remake. For one thing the disc drive is now toploading so if people would buy this becuse they dont have much space in their cabinet can forget it. For example if you had slipped it into a small space you would have to remove it when you want to put a game in. Althought this is slim and great looking i dont reccomend it. What has annoyed me about sony is that the more popular the playstation gets the quality gets worse because they think that it is so popular that it wont matter. I own a ps2 (fat) a gamecube and a x-box. out of the 3 the x-box is the best then ps2 then gamecube (purely because of the amount of games) My ps2 was given to me about a year ago and it was one of the first ps2s made because my cousin bought it on the launch date. I havnt had any problems with it at all but most of my friends who own ps2s have had something go wrong with them. I think that the more popular ps2 gets the cheaper sony makes them for so they break more. I reccomend the fat ps2 because it has sliding disc tray and iy is sooooo better. One of my friends has the slim ps2 and it is tiny, About the size of a ps2 game case. But the disc toploader feels flimsy and when you open it it is not a smooth action. If you have buy a ps2 buy a fat one because they are the best in my opinion but buy an x-box because they are the best or just buy an x-box."
5,These do what I need,"I got a NES Classic for my birthday last year and rarely played it as the cords were too short.  I ordered these and my wife and I enjoyed it with enough cord to not have to sit right in front of the tv.  I've only used for about an hour, but so far so good."
5,Better than expected,"I previously bought another power supply. Roughly same price range, and it was horrible. Died on me within a month. Was loud too, even when I turned my xbox off. Got this one, and wasn't expecting too much better, but I was pleasantly surprised. This is very quiet and I've been using it a lot for 1-2 weeks. If it holds up and still performs as good as it has been so far, I'll definitely buy it again when necessary...hopefully no time soon though."
4,INCLUDES BATTERY,"one thing that took me a while to find out, it does include a battery"
1,doesn't play playstation 4 games,"why anybody would get this console is beyond me.  Playstation 4 is ushering the new era of video gaming, all hail SONY"
5,Old English Recipes,"This is a small, beautifully illustrated cookbook, featuring text from the Lark Rise trilogy. I haven't tried any of the recipes yet. My only disappointment is that a number of recipes from the TV series were not featured, such as calves foot jelly and queen cake."
5,Five Stars,excellent
1,Double click - Be warned!,"Loved this mouse for 3 months, absolutely everything. Then one day it started to randomly double click on the right mouse button, but only maybe once per 1,000 clicks, no big deal right? Wrong. This escalates and quickly becomes to 1 in every 10 clicks just a month after you notice the first double click issue starting. Being a ""gaming mouse"", and a reputable company, I expected more. I took the time to write the review now because after 4 months with my right click double clicking every 1 out of 10 clicks the left mouse button has started the 1 out of 1,000. My fear is that in another month I'll have the same issue with the left click. This mouse is already un-usable for gaming as any fps with scopes become unplayable as you cannot reliably ADS or hold scopes in fear that it will double click and make you lose ADS or lose your scope."
5,This is funny!,I bought this game because it's name sounded funny lol But after playing it I'm more that happy with my decision. You need to play this game!
5,Great game. Beautiful and calming to play,Great game. Beautiful graphics and fun to play with my son. Plus having Scandinavian Heritage is a nice connection to the game
5,Five Stars,"Sweet game. Wish there was a coop campaign mode like Halo, but this is a great game."
5,Affordable backlit keyboard.,I like this one. Has good controls for color and brightness. The directions are even printed inside the box and comes on a slip. Directions are practically idiot proof. Not as loud or as noisy as other more expensive gaming keyboards.
1,Not made for Switch Pro Controller,"These grips were not made for this controller. The Nintendo switch pro controller has a clear guideline where the grips COULD have used to align their grips properly, but it seems no thought when into this design. When I put it one the controller, there was a clear overlap in the grips. I tried removing and re-applying many times, but no matter how I put it, there was always a clear overlap. It seems that all they did was get the xbox grip and rename it for the switch."
2,Too short,I enjoyed very much and it was amazing but i was very disappointed on how short it was i mean i beat it in half an hour it was very good storyline though but jeez the it could of been a little longer i do not recommend it for people that want to enjoy a long game
5,"Better than the official case, and I owned both.","This Khanka case is actually better than the official RDS industries one because on this one the controllers lay flat on each other and you can insert the cables all the way in the case. In the official one you had to insert the controller with the cable sticking up, causing the case to put stress on the connection point when you closed it. With the Khanka case the remotes have zero stress on them anywhere, without sacrificing protection. I owned both and returned the official RDS one. Don't be fooled by the cheaper price or funny name, this Khanka case is the superior case for your NES Classic, if you managed to get one."
5,Did not stick properly,"Did not stick properly, I am currently awaiting a replacement or refund."
5,Better than I even expected!,Received quickly for a trip.  Was as described and even better than I expected.  It made playing my switch w my family so much fun in the evenings w nothing else to do in our hotel room!! My parents even had fun with it!!
1,Run Don't walk away from this one -,"First off its cheaply made - Yes I know its supposed to be a knock off but still there are several options out there. This one uses proprietary plastic joysticks, less than a month of EXTREMLY light game-play, The left stick broke. So I didn't panic I ordered a replacement - took the controller apart and found that the parts are not compatible."
1,Missing the game!,This would be fun if the game was in the case.  It was empty!!!!
4,It's important to know this gift card will take hours to receive the code,"For over a year I have been buying my Robux from Amazon, I try to avoid buying on Roblox because the keep making me deal with Xsoalla! what a nightmare that is. It now seems like it's better to just buy a gift card from the store, and avoid purchasing online all together. They make you wait 2-4 hours to process the payment and then you will get your Robux pin."
1,Don't buy not 680 games only 30 none of the good ones.,Only had 30 games and none of the good ones.No Mario ect.
5,"Hypnotic, bet you can't play just once!!","This is not your typical game.  You manipulate the little musical ""beings"" to dance and sing and make lots of noise.  You can even speak to them and they will respond in your voice!About 14 different sounds of your changed voice. Whoever invented this one was a genius.  Lots of fun if you are looking to just kick back and play with this one for hours!! The graphics are mesmerizing, and very cool!"
5,Just plain awesome,"As of this writing, Mario Kart DS is hands down the absolute best game available for the DS.  As one would expect from the long running series, Mario Kart DS allows you to play as Mario and co. in a series of go-kart races.  The gameplay mechanics will feel like putting on an old glove for longtime fans of the series, while newcomers will have no trouble getting into the game.  As you progress through the various circuits, you'll find bonus tracks, karts, and characters to unlock as well, which adds a nice amount of replayability to the single player mode.  Along with the new tracks, there are some retro tracks available as well taken from the past incarnations of the series.  The real main attraction of Mario Kart DS however, is the fantastic Wi-Fi multiplayer mode.  There are only a handful of DS games which support Wi-Fi capability, and none is better at it than Mario Kart.  This is where the real meat and potatoes of the game lies, and you'll have a hard time putting down your DS after getting a taste of it.  The game looks, sounds, and plays phenominally, and all in all, Mario Kart DS is yet another excellent, must own, first party title for the DS, and the Wi-Fi options make it even more of a smash."
4,Good customer service,"Got this refurbished system to use as a way for some older folks to get some activity. After some hiccups, turned out a controller was faulty. The customer service was excellent and they went out of their way to make It right."
5,As good as the wheel that comes with Mario Kart,We have 3 of these wheels and the one that came with Mario Kart.  The only difference is the wii emblem on the back of the original wheel.  Seriously I think there must be a copyright infringement these wheels are so alike.  If you like the wheel that came with Mario Kart these are perfect additions for extra racers.
4,The only drawback is the missing PGA,"Wow.  What a great game on the DS.  This is not the prettiest game, or the most notable.  But it is FUN FUN FUN!  Using the stylus to control the swing works great.  Nintendo continues to innovate and change the way we play games.  There are at least 15 courses.  This is enough to keep anyone entertained for a long long time.  There are no PGA anything in this game.  But for what it lacks in realism it makes up for in fun.  Get this game if you have even a moderate affinity for golf."
5,Can't go wrong,"By far the most comfortable headset I've ever worn! This headset is adjustable to fit any size of head, and when worn the padding around the ears and on top of the head are so comfortable, I tend to forget I'm even wearing them. I have had no issues with the sound quality, and everything seems to sound just fine. One last thing that stands out is the high quality thread that is braided around the cord that give the nice appearance and added durability. Great headset for a great price!"
5,Awesome!!,"This game is awesome! Great songs, fun, addictive and challenging to play. I have not been really into a game in years, that has changed with this one! The cost is well worth it in terms of time spent playing. Excellent game!!"
1,Do Not Buy!!!  3 Month Game Pass Ultimate is Showing as a Trial,"Been trying to redeem my code for a couple hours now and keep getting the pictured error. Tried Xbox support and they said talk to Amazon, chatted with Amazon support and they said call Xbox again. Awaiting my call back from Xbox again. Will update if this gets resolved. Tried entering via xbox app, website, and console all same error."
1,Simcity Online only?!,"So if their servers are down, I'm down too? Not very practical. What if my ISP went Ka-Blooey, then I'm Ka-Blooey too? Not very practical!"
5,Links the ps4 to the gaming chair!,"We bought our kid a gaming chair, not realizing it would not link to the ps4. I don't know exactly what we did; however, after some fiddling and switching the pieces around, got it to work! This little adapter made his new favorite chair even better. We haven't figured out how to get the mic to work, yet. But, at least the ps4 audio is playing out the chair speakers!"
1,This game is dumb,"There's too much to do, the world is too big and i don't understand much of it. I'm gonna go play Super Mario World now."
4,A Hilarious Laugh-a-Minute Game!,"This is a great game! Whenever my friends come over they go straight for this thing! It's hilarious! They make their mom have a mustasche and a pig-snout, they put Mario on their brothers' shoulders, its great fun! Once you save a picture you can do whatever you like to it! You can draw, you can stamp things on it, you can give it a caption and a frame! Great fun!"
1,Make sure you have the right video card before you buy.,There should have been something on the purchase page that warns you about the need for a certain graphics card needed to run the software. I have a 8 month old Dell 17 inspiron 3000 and can't run the basic software. I'm not a big gamer but enjoy flight Sims. Disappointed that the basic version of MS Flight Simulator 2020 won't run for me
1,Love the game hate the BLS mart scam.,"As a true gamer, I wanted the exclusive alt suit. To get that type of game I had to pay a little more for it. The uncage version only cost 12 to 15 dollars. The game I wanted was 25 at the most not include shipping. When I ordered it I expected to get what I paid for. Once the game got here it wasn't what I paid for, and BLS mart knew exactly what they was doing. And they scammed me out. I even complained and emailed them but no respond so I knew clearly I was suckered out. But that fine because I usually don't forget n I will never order from BLS mart. If I was you I check with BLS mart before ordering anything. If anybody looking for me to tell my experience of the alt suit wolverine, I wouldn't know because BLS mart sent the wrong game and I'm complaining because they scammed me out."
1,Huge let down to say the least. Been a ...,Huge let down to say the least. Been a halo fanatic since day one and this just isn't the same. 343 without a doubt ruined yet another game. Why bungie why
1,It lasted almost 4 days and now it won't turn ...,It lasted almost 4 days and now it won't turn on? Just shut down in the middle of a game!
5,Use HDMI input on your TV or Monitor,"This does not make the Wii do HD resolution (no adaptor can). What it does do it allow me to plug into my widescreen HDMI monitor. Or my into my smart TV which has 10 HDMI inputs and a very dumb single style video in and no S-Video. The picture is quality is nerly imperceptibly more sharp, solid, clear, and colorful than S-Video would provide. It also works with my DVI-HDMI adaptors."
2,The OTHER REVIEWS ARE CORRECT,I bought the FS Fighter Pilot while in a computer store a couple of months ago while I was perusing other sim games. It caught my eye and I bought it. What a mistake. The most pathetic of all aircraft in the package is the F-15...especially the cockpit. This teaches me to not buy a product without researching the reviews about it. Lesson learned.
1,"Wow, waste of my time and money... BS FROM BI!","Ok, here's the deal with Bohemia Interactive.  They are shortsighted.  They are lazy.  They expect you to be the beta testers of their product whilst you pay them to do such work.  They did not prepare their game for Windows 7 knowing full and well it was coming.  The game still uses Directx 9 even though we're already onto 11.  They want you to fumble through all the instability and troubleshoot the game to try to find its problems so you can report to them.  I believe more people than not are having trouble with ARMA II.  I did not buy this game to test it, I bought it as a product of entertainment.  I have not been entertained by it.  No amount of, nor particular fixes on the net have amended the random CTD during gameplay.  I'm not about to revert to XP just for this garbage.  They're already planning an expansion pack despite having not fixed all current problems.  Don't waste your time with this company or this game.  You'll be so disappointed to find it's not what you were hoping for.  The idea of this game is great... but a respectable company with integrity needs to execute it."
5,"Decent, inexpensive.","I bought this for working at home during the quarantine. I have a better left handed mouse at work, but this one does the job just fine. I'm right handed, but switch to the left in order to give my right hand a break. I recommend this to anyone that does a lot of mousing in their job. It has definitely saved me from injury. The mouse itself is definitely no frills, very simple and seems to be accurate enough. Being rechargeable is a bonus."
2,Relisted to clear bad reviews? Poor QC?,"I knew this unit was a decent choice but often has lighting issues after extended use. Noticed this looked to be a new listing or model so i took a chance. Out of the box my Multi Function Display on my Throttle does not have backlighting and the Throttle Force Tensioning dial has no discernible effect of the throttle tension, be it at its max or min setting.....  unit are a bit light, it would be nice to have the bases weighted. I will have to DIY some steel plates to the bottom to prevent them from shifting in use."
5,worked better than expensive headphones,worked better than expensive headphones. Save your money and buy these. My son plays online video games with these headphones all the time and never has any issues. He has a PS 4.
2,Save the swordplay for The Legend of Zelda...,"I feel that the fighting in this game takes out the very ""soul"" of this beloved simulation game series.  Harvest Moon is about living the quiet life (befriending the neighbors, marrying, building up your farm, raising your child that actually grows up).  The fact that the original series is relaxing and a break from fighting games in general is what makes it so appealing in the first place. It's uniqueness in lack of violence is what makes it a jewel.  If you have an itch to fight in dungeons, play the Legend of Zelda games! The way the stamina bars are set up makes it very limiting to how much you can do in a day.  I also didn't like the whole catching your monsters (livestock) in the caves.  It just makes it more work than it's worth.  The only good thing about this game really are the graphics, which are indeed eye candy.  For those who find the original Harvest Moon series boring, then maybe this game is your cup-of-tea.  But if you're like me and fighting isn't vital to your gaming, and if you're also a huge fan of the original Harvest Moon series, then I advise against getting this game."
5,Review After 7 Hours Into The Game,"I am already 7 hours into the game since the midnight release. Here are my thoughts so far...get this game..form a posse..and rule the wild west..instead of looking at reviews you should just get up and buy it. Though there are many similarities between the grand theft auto series and red dead redemption, red dead redemption can stand up proudly by itself. The massive sandbox map and the variety of tasks at hand can make this game way too awesome at times. This isn't a bad thing as you will always have something to do but it adds stress to the gamer with so many options. I dont want to ruin anything but I will say that this game is funny, full of action, full of choices, and anything I say won't do this game any justice. Just buy it yourself and you'll see what I mean. Theres just too much to do and I can't fit it all into words."
5,Best alternative for me!,"This Game is absolutely incredible and a fantastic alternative, for me because I have cerebral palsy and cannot use my lower body very well so I always wanted to play games like Dance Dance Revolution and never could, but now I can!! Thank you Disney and to whoever made this game!"
5,Good,"This gaming keyboard not also looking good, and it is also really soft the keys are really feel good. Really love it."
1,Not for me,"I'd heard good things about the Silent Hill games but hadn't played before ordering. I wish I would have because this game is terrible. The story line did not make sense, the directions were unclear and the lighting was so dark that it was hard to make out what was going on. I couldn't get anywhere without an online walkthrough and even still the game was boring and confusing."
5,VR necessity,"Great for the Quest 2, never run out of battery!"
5,Genuine Sanwa Parts,"Many people seem to be thrown off by the 'made in china' stickers when fulfilled by amazon, but the seller's website clarifies that it is a misrepresentation from the import process. Check the QR code that comes with the packaging. The buttons and the lever are a big improvement over the hori parts that came with my RAP. Highly recommend."
1,Improper region code,"I was enr the UK version, and I live in the US..  I cannot trade it in, andit wont play on my machine...  Amzone has provided no was to fix this.  I will sue them, and expose them  for this"
5,"Great Story, Fast Combat","Very fun and addictive action RPG with a great storyline, and amazing fast paced combat. Pretty much everything about this game is amazing. Only complaint I have is the game's performance. It's not exactly as high as it could be performance-wise, as the resolution isn't amazing, and there's ocasional lag. But after playing for an hour or two, it becomes easy to look past it's performance issues and see the game for what it is: a masterfully crafted RPG that anyone can enjoy. Even if you're not into RPGs, you may still find this game enjoyable. It has a wide range of difficulty levels to choose from, and the combat is so fast that it never feels too grindy. And as a bonus, the adventurerers edition comes with some awesome bonuses. I couldn't be happier with this game, and I highly recommend checking it out."
5,A Must for Hardcore DS Players,"Purchased this grip because the size and button layout on the 2DS makes holding the system uncomfortable. This makes holding the controller much more comfortable. System is study and tightly fit in the grip and is easy to take out. The stand in the back is a nice touch. Turning the system on and off is a bit of an issue since the hole in the grip allocated for it is small, but I've just been using the stylus instead."
5,Just as expected,"I love this keyboard! It's functional and beautiful. You cannot program the colors, but I wanted the rainbow, so this is fine for me. The keyboard is lit up as long as it's plugged in, so it does always stay on. If you plan to use this keyboard for work, note that the keys are LOUD. I don't work near other people, so this is fine for me. However, if you're in a cubicle type setting near others it probably would annoy the people around you. But, if you work in a secluded area or use it for gaming, it's perfect! The key clicks sound like a mixture of a typewriter and an old windows computer. It's like a deep click and a lighter click at the same time. Overall, worth the money and it makes emailing at work more fun!"
5,Fantastic DDR System!!!,"I bought this game for my 12 year old, who is a die-hard Mario fan.  I fully anticipated that he would enjoy the game, but never expected that my 8 year daugther would also fall in love with this game.  My children are having an exceptional cardio work out every day and believing that they are just playing a game.  I would recommend this to everyone!!!  The dance pad is included in the system and is holding up very well considering how much use it is getting.  I am very pleased with this purchase."
5,"If you love Mario Kart, get this game","A few years back, I got rid of our Wii. The kids really didn't play it much, and it was just taking up space. After all, we play on our Xbox One for most games and really didn't have much use for most of what Wii had to offer. But what I didn't expect was how much I would find myself wishing I could play Mario Kart again. There just really aren't many other games out there like it -- especially on the Xbox platform. Most car racing games are too complicated, difficult to play and have limited head-to-head racing modes. So I ran across this game and heard it was similar to Mario Kart. I decided to give it a try... and I've got to say, I'm loving it. In addition to the traditional racing modes, circuits and battle racing modes, Cars 3: Driven to Win also introduces stunt driving and a couple of other variations that I honestly like even better than Mario Kart. This is fast becoming one of my family's favorite games, and it's nice to have a game that literally everyone of all ages can enjoy. My only gripe is that there's not more of a better online multiplayer experience. I imagine this is just because the game is getting old at this point and fewer people are playing. Hopefully if and when a new Cars movie comes out, they'll continue the game franchise. If you're a Mario Kart fan and have an Xbox One... I highly recommend this game."
5,One of the best games to hit the Wii yet,"The Metroid Prime series took Nintendo's much loved series to a new level with the first two installments of the series on the Gamecube.  Now, finally, the Prime trilogy is completed with Metroid Prime 3: Corruption, which is undoubtedly the best FPS on the Wii, and one of the best overall game to hit the system yet.  Once again playing as intergalactic space heroine Samus Aran, you should feel right at home here the minute you fire up the game.  Even with a new control scheme that takes advantage of the Wii-mote and nunchuk controls, veterans of the series will have little to no trouble getting into the swing of things.  As you can expect, there are a fair share of inventive puzzles and great levels to explore, and the boss battles are nothing short of spectacularly memorable as well.  If there are any downsides to Metroid Prime 3, it's that the game can be too easy for some, and that as a whole, doesn't really do a whole lot more differently than the previous Metroid Prime games have done.  That aside though, Metroid Prime 3: Corruption is a more than worthy conclusion to the Prime trilogy and has been more than worth the wait as well.  It also goes without saying that this is the best FPS on the system yet, and one of the best games available for the Wii at this time."
1,Another 1 Star Review Because of One Island Per Switch,"While I can see that the decision to allow only 1 island per switch was made in an attempt to foster cooperation between the people who play the game on the same console, not allowing the individual profiles to opt-out and start their own island is a crippling mistake. For anyone who uses their switch by themselves this game is pretty fun, but anyone who shares their switch with another person and wants the ability to play this game on their own, and only occasionally play together, will be sorely disappointed to find that the first island created on a given switch is forced upon every subsequent player who plays the game on that switch. Nintendo, please consider removing this arbitrary and, for many of us game-breaking restriction so those of us who share a switch console with others can enjoy the game how we choose to enjoy it."
1,Wish I hadn't wasted my money,The device just shuts down and resets even when fully charged. There is also no way to save a game.
1,One Star,when i got the package it was already open and there was no game cd inside the case
4,No problems...delivered as described,"Seller delivered as advertised...overpriced but if you want it now, not a terrible option.."
4,Really fun game,"Alrighty so as someone who loves the puzzle solving part of Zelda games but gets frustrated when I'm in the middle of solving a puzzle and gets killed by some stupid thing in the game while I'm in the middle of puzzle solving and then have to do the whole thing all over again, this is great because it's just the fun puzzle solving! No annoying monsters to kill you while you're puzzle solving whatsoever! The music is fantastic, the scenery is great because it's mythical Iceland and Iceland is beautiful and you play as an adorable red fox! What's not to love? My only complaint and the reason why I gave it four stars is because it's a short game w six or seven chapters. I wish it was longer! They should make a sequel w at least 15 to 20 chapters if not more because the game play is fun, relaxing, stimulating and unique."
5,Great Budget Controller,"I snagged this controller to play some PC games with less-than-ideal mouse and keyboard controls, and it works fantastically! You just plug it in and play, and it works just like any Playstation or Xbox controller with no problems whatsoever.  It's lightweight and feels good in your hands, and I'd highly recommend it to anyone in need of a wired USB controller at a budget price!"
5,Comfort and ease,"This takes the Vive from OK to just about perfect as far as ease and comfort goes. It is supper simple to take on and off and feels so much better. I am using mine with the TPCAST wireless adapter and have attached the battery to the strap below the adjustment knob for a truly wireless setup. It is balanced almost perfectly. The headphones are very comfortable and sound good for what they are. This is a no brainer, and should come standard."
5,Amazing product with amazing customer service!,"I bought this for my kids as a gift and they play it everyday all day. Our first one had an internal glitch where it wouldn't power down, every time you plugged it up it turned itself back on. I contacted the Meta customer service and we went through all the steps to reset and factory reset and still it wouldn't power down. Luckily they understood the problem wasn't our doing, they had us send it back and they shipped us another one for free. Easy, friendly, and patient customer service and amazing product that we all love! Highly recommend!!!! Kids are 9 and 11... haven't broken anything or hurt anyone in almost a year. Wish I would have bought 2, maybe for Christmas."
5,several 1 star reviews exposed as fake within hours of launch,"I just turned on my Xbox one an hour ago but I wanted to come review this because while updating I read an article exposing a bunch of amazon reviews on this console that were clearly fake reviews giving the Xbox a 1.  What poor form, sorry guys.  :(. Enjoying Xbox one so far!"
5,Family time!,arived brand new. Great packaging! Very happy!
2,Great book poor Kindle transfer,This review is not about the book which I have read before and really enjoyed. I would give the book 4.5 stars. This is specifically about the Kindle edition. In addition to the typos that have been mentioned before there are sections of the book that are missing. I have spent way too much time trying to figure out if I have somehow jumped around unintentionally. Amazon should really do a better job of reviewing the Kindle editions.
2,whats up with the mics from hyper X...  this and flights...,"first and foremost these are really comfy,  they would be a five out of five starts yet the mic on ps4 only picks up my voice half of the time. even when  raising the mic sensitivity on the system.  therefore if you need this to play with friends its  too much of a hassle and not worth it.., if you do not need the mic they by all means its a great headset  for everything else"
5,Budokai 2 Looking Good,"First of all I would like to point out that the game will NOT be 3-D. It will be cel-shaded because that seems to be what everyone is doing now. But one amazing thing this game will have is a fusion capsule. It will enable you to fuse any two characters in the game!! The game will contain 34 characters in all including the ones from the first Budokai. I'm pretty sure this one will have Majin Buu, Kid Buu, Super Buu, Videl, Dabura,and for some reason Dr. Gero although it would have made more sense for them to put him in the first one. And don't delete your data from Budokai from your memory card because all of your skills will be transferrable to Budokai 2. One thing they decided to change is the Story Mode. Sadly there will not be a Story Mode to Budokai 2. It will be something called Dragon World. You and your party of 3 more people will go around the world and search for Dragonballs but if you meet up with a villain who wants the Dragonball you must fight him. You can let the COM fight him or you can fight him yourself... And you will actually get a reward for finishing the Legend of Hercule. I was never informed on what the reward is though. Nor do I know what you will be doing in the Legend of Hercule mode this time either. But I can tell you from searching for it on the net that your character will move more swift, the blast will be bigger and cause more damage, and the new battle places like Capsule Corp or Orange High School (Where Gohan goes to school), will be MUCH more destructible if you happen to be knocked through a wall..... Or 5 or 6....... If you'd seen the clip that they had up at dragonballz.com then you know what I mean. But no doubt Budokai 2 will be something worth waiting for. Pre-order yours from amazon.com now!!"
4,Four stars for four year olds,"I considered being a bit harsher grading this, but given that my four year old daughter really enjoys this, I figure four stars is fair.  My problem with it is in the Queen Frostine area where the user has to color several pictures to advance.  This is the hardest area and is made even more difficult by the small spaces the user has to point and click into in order to add color.  This isn't a major problem and does get easier as their mouse skills improve, but on first use, I thought it unnecessarily hard.  Otherwise, my kids all love it (ages 10-4) and my youngest, who it belongs to, loves playing it again and again.  It's fun and sweet with songs and silliness a youngster would enjoy."
5,Than you devs for a physical version.,"This game looks shockingly beautiful on a good TV.  Rich colors that pop, the sound is very well done.  This is a game worth owning.  I just wanted to send a thanks to whoever was essential in bringing this out physically for us collectors.  This game is worthy of displaying on your shelf."
1,Waste of money,Awful
5,MAG A different type of shooter,"When you decide to play MAG, you need to clear your mind of all the impressions you have a what an FPS game is. I think one of the biggest reasons for people not enjoying the game is their preconceptions of the FPS genre through games such as COD: Modern Warfare 2 and others. If you are looking for a game where you can reign supreme and claim ""I was in the TOP 3 of all the players"" or want to hear a narrator yelling ""Multikill!"" as you fend off the entire enemy force by jumping erratically and using power-ups, then this is not the game for you. This game is realistic. It shoves up to 256 players onto the same map into brutal combat. You will not be a hero, you will not be ""God-like"", you will be an everyday grunt just trying to push the line forward and claim a small piece of victory. This is the ultimate war game. I don't think you will find a game closer to real war than this. It is the new evolution of FPS games. It is strictly multi-player. There is no single player, there are no bots. Its you vs. a living breathing human every time. This is war. This is what it means to be a soldier. Try it if you dare."
5,My 4 year old loves this!,"We have lots of gamers in our house.  And my 2 ...and 4 year old try and keep up with their older brothers. This 2DS is perfect. It's durable and easy to use for kid and adult size hands.  No folding which means no accidental snapping of hinges.  It's like a Gameboy upgraded.  You can use 3DS games in this 2DS, but it obviously won't display in 3D."
1,Really Horrible,"This was my first Sonic game on the 360 and it is really bad. The graphics are not much. But that's not the worst part. The game really proceeds slowly. I think there are many unnecessary loads. For example, when doing a little mini-game to get something you have to wait for 20 seconds until it loads, then some guy explains what you must do and I usually press A to skip, at once another 20 second load starts. The mini-game takes about a minute and another 20 second load. If you fail, the whole load thing starts again. The controls are messed up too as well a camera angles. Save the money and buy something else. I got so bored with this game that I just quit after couple of levels."
5,Awesome RPG and cool collectibles,Awesome game and although the wayfarer was expensive it was worth it for me. I have it as part of my gaming cave setup
5,Very solid.,"Monster Kingdom: Jewel Summoner is similar to the legendary Pokémon and Final Fantasy Series. If you liked either of those, this is without a doubt the right game for you. It has a simple but entertaining storyline, a solid battle system, and a wonderfully diverse monster system. I found this game to be highly entertaining, and really couldn't find a problem with this game. I recommend it very much, and I think that this game is another solid PSP title."
5,Perfect puzzle-like game,"This game is very cool- I am in my late 20's and I love puzzle games on the DS for traveling. The game gives you the I Spy puzzles where you have to find the hidden objects, and in each puzzle, there is a mini-game, it's a lot of fun and very addictive. I would definitely recommend to all ages."
5,LIked it so much I bought two more as gifts for friends. Seriously.,"I use this at work and get compliments all the time. Other reviewers complain about the texture of the keys. Yeah, they aren't smooth but that doesn't bother me even the slightest. The only con, for me, is that the white keys easily show discoloration from makeup and dirt on my hands. It reminds me to not touch my face so much and use more hand sanitizer. Gross."
5,NES classic must have,A must have if you don't want to play your NES classic with your nose against your flat screen TV. The controller cord is longer than the one that came with the system which is nice. The two extension cords clip in and don't pull out unless the button is push. A good purchase.
4,Do not overlook this game.,"Risen has got to be one of the best rpg's to hit the 360 this year. The graphics are not the best for the 360 and the voice acting isn't much better, but this game is addicting to play. There are plenty of side missions along with the main story line to keep you busy for hours. When killing enemies you can search them to take some of the animal meat and before you can eat it you need a frying pan and a fire to cook it, you can pick plants and mushrooms to combine and mix into stronger potions, you can learn to be a blacksmith so you can make your own equipment, or learn to be a thief and pickpocket people while you talk to them and if you are caught stealing you get beaten buy the gaurds and whoever you stole from and they stay mad at you until you use a joke spell or joke scroll to make them like you again. From what I've played so far it seems like it is a massive openworld adventure with some oblivion elements but not a copycat ripoff. When you level up I think it picks your upgrades automatically unless there is a way to do it manually that I haven't figured out yet. Some downfalls in the game is the controls take alittle time getting used to, when doing missions you actually have to figure out where you got to go since mission markers don't appear on the map which isn't a big deal once you get used to it, that just means more looking around. Besides the fact that you need a frying pan to cook, you can also get a broom so you can sweep floors, you can get a saw so you can cut trees, you can get a pick axe so you can mine for minerals, I'm sure there is more to do I just haven't made it that far yet. In my opinion this game does what the first fable tried to promise, A massive open world adventure where your choices actaully change the outcome of the game, plant's grow back over time. Get this game, you wont regret it."
5,Great Game,"Love the game and the graphics.  In the last few days it has provided hours of fun for the entire family.  From the four year old all the way up to the adults, we all love it."
1,Biggest let down of the year,May as well buy the 100 dollar version because the only way to do anything is buying VC. This is the biggest let down of a video game I've had since No Man's Sky. 2ks greed needs to be exposed to the casual gamer because this game has turned into all micro transactions that you have to pay 60 dollars to get access to. The story is the most cringe terrible thing I've seen with unskippable cutscenes and terrible acting. The story Semmes to be written by an adult that thinks they know what's cool and in these days and it comes across as awkwardly as it sounds. Do yourself a favor and skip this.
2,Really awful. Buggy software,"My girls ages 5 and 7 begged me for this software. I finally gave in even though the whole concept of creating fake finger nails did not appeal to me.  They enjoyed the music selections that play while you create the nails  which is the main reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1.  The program comes  with some sticker sheets which only contain one set of nails each and  wastes tons and tons of printable space.  I found it completely impossible  to line up the paper so that the little squares would print in the correct  spots! Extremely irritating! Once I got them somewhat lined up, the girls  were very disappointed in the final product. It sparkles on the screen, not  on the paper after all! My five year old will on occasion go in and make up  some nails and listen to music, but she will be bored in about 10 minutes  and on to another game."
5,Great Family Friendly Game,"This is a great Family friendly game system.  The Games have a wide age range from  preschoolers(A Bugs Life, Mickey Mouse) to Adult like PerfectDark, Goldeneye. There are sports fantasy games, action, roleplaying etc, something for everyone.Also Nintendo is the only company liscensed to sell Pokemon,if your kids are still into that. You can play up to 4 players on most games.(A few are one person only) The cartridge system is easy for young children to handle with out damaging them unlike the CD's a Playstation uses... No freeze ups, or blips that shut your game down in the middle before you can save it. My son had been asking for a Playstation for almost a year, until he played on one at a friends house, he changed his mind after the games kept freezing up in the middle of a race or action scene or they kept shutting down and makking him restart the game. Also most of the games save within the game cartridge itself, no extra memory cards to buy. If you are interested in blood, guts and gore, then go with Playstation. But if you want a versatile system for the whole family then N64 is the one."
1,Bad buy stay away,This charger broke in both my controllers making them useless. I have been trying for hours to get the pieces out with no luck.  I am out two controllers and can not use my PS
1,junk,"we had this for an hour and a half.  The first hour twenty nine, all good.  the golf club WAS cool cause it extended.  then on a normal drive, the club broke into many pieces hitting the tv, wii console, dvd, etc.  i would never reccomend this!"
1,Very Dissatisfied,Ordered the item pictured in this listing. Received wrong item. Very upset and looking online this seems to have happened to a lot of customers.
5,Review with a Clue,"I was looking for the most secure way of buying Runescape membership and I knew if I had any problems I would be able to contact either amazon or Jagex. I was very happy with my purchase except the fact that as soon as I bought this some of my real life stats began to decrease. I notice that while my agility and combat stats on Runescape increased the agility of my real life character declined, and with that so did my strength, health, and Magic (Yes I'm magical)"
1,Beware:SteamHasTurnedThisGameOff!DO NOT BUY!,"Loved it, been playing for years, since Civ3. However Steam has, over the Thanksgiving weekend, forced an update that renders the game unusable. DO NOT BUY! Steam wants everyone to buy Civ6 instead. Really. One month before Christmas and we are either supposed to buy a new game for ourselves or add to our wish list and do without for a month. Don't believe me? Go to the Steam community. You'll see."
5,Finaly single player experience is included,"I never played the original titanfall because I don't do any online gaming but it seemed like it would be interesting. I was very happy to hear this game would have a single player campaign. I can honestly say it was a blast playing through it. I don't mess with the multiplayer so I can't comment on that aspect, but the single player mode was a lot of fun and had a great story. The graphics are very good for those who dwell on such issues. I prefer to focus on game play itself and this game delivers in that regard. The controls are very fluid and easy to pick up. Their were two or three times where the difficult ramps up significantly for a few moments, but other than that I highly recommend this to first person shooter fans, sci fi shooter fans, or people who like futuristic combat. It's a shame it did not sell that well, but I suspect that was due to being released so closely to Battlefield 1 (also a great game) and Call Of Duty Infinite Warfare (have not played yet, not really interested to be honest). All in all a great game."
5,Great Deal!,"I bought all of these games separately and love them (and I'm an adult--you definitely don't have to be a kid to enjoy these games). This package is a great deal--you get the first five Nancy Drew games for the price of one. This is a good starter pack for a ND newbie before because not only is it very affordable, it includes several of the best games of the series, including my favorite, Treasure in the Royal Tower. Just be sure not to start with Secrets Can Kill (or if you do, don't base your opinion of the series on it). It was the very first one made and the quality is not very good. Happy sleuthing!"
1,Sad!,"Just didn't live up to my expectations. They left to much for the mod community to finish off, especially to have 3 years to work on it."
1,Waiting for warranty response from the seller.,"I purchased this item in September and waited for the Xbox one X to be released so I could buy and use it. Well, less than 2 months after my purchased, when I was finally able to buy the console, the battery pack just won't charge. When I plug the charging cable it lights up in yellow, stays yellow for 10 minutes and then turns white as if it was charged, but doesn't last more than 5 minutes playing. I sent the seller a message with a warranty replacement request and am waiting for a response. I will update this review if he's able to fix things up."
1,Lost Case of Using this on a Mac,"I recently purchased The Lost Cases of Sherlock Holmes and loaded it on my iMac which is running Snow Leopard, the latest Apple operating system.  The application loaded just fine but it will not run.  When I reached out to Legacy Interactive they responded with ""The software is an older title, and is not supported in Snow leopard.""  This is really lame."
5,perfect for the oculus quest,"this fits my oculus quest, controllers, and charger perfectly. its snug but not overly tight, and has room for everything without crowding, including the addition of a 10,000mah battery pack. i looked at a lot of cases before finally settling on this one, and for the price, its definitely a winner. id cheerfully have paid double for it."
5,It's actually pretty kool!!,"I know that everyone believe that a horizontal stand is useless...but if you have an extra 10 bucks then go for it.  Recently I purchased the horizontal stand in addition to the vertical stand.  While I was using the vertical stand, my PS2 scratched my Tekken Tag and now it is defective and cannot be played. I reported the problem to Namco and they informed me that when the PS2 is placed vertically, it has a chance to scratch the game and that the problem should be reported to Sony.  So anyway, now I only put my PS2 horizontally just in case...so I don't have to shell out another 50 bucks...When you put the PS2 horizontally with the stand, it looks pretty dope too. Give it a try!"
1,Unforgivable performance issues,"I am a student at a Maritime Academy, so I should be well within the target market for this game. I have a quad-core i7 processor and 1gb video card that runs Skyrim and Bioshock Infinite flawlessly but ship simulator extremes does not run well enough to play at all on my rig no matter how I tweak the graphical settings. You can't solve the problem with a more beefy system because this game doesn't take advantage of multiple cores. I really really want a descent ship simulator, this game just isn't it."
1,Waste of money,Do not buy this product. I got mine yesterday and the power adapter does not work. The speakers will power up but the PS2 will not! The AV output does not send a clear signal to the tv. Worthless!!!!
5,A lot of fun,"Kids love it - easy to use and was fun to build.  The only issue is that every time you play as a new player, it makes you watch a portion of the video where you build the robot.  Once built you should be able to skip the video and go straight to the game.  Not sure why it's this way.  Overall fun and a great toy."
1,CD's have a glitch,"Bought this game on cd twice, once here and once at best buy. both cds had the same issue, freezing problem. game was unplayable. Buy the online version instead"
5,"Installs in seconds, looks great!",They came quickly and worked great. Study the plates and you can see the little notches at the top of them that the original plates use to slot in. VERY easy to take off and replace with these plates. Highly recommended to make your gaming cabinet match!
4,"Fun for your kid, maybe not for you","I consider myself an experienced gamer, so it's not to be taken lightly when I say that 102 Dalmations is a surprisingly decent game. Sure it's easy, but it's meant for the kiddies, not for the hardcore gamer. The graphics get the job done without too much pop-up (although it's there) and the voice acting is solid. If you need to get a game for a beginning gamer, try this one out."
1,Headset broke after a couple months.,I would have given a decent review but this stupid headset broke after a couple of months.  Very unhappy with that.  Cant return it.
5,Awesome Mouse for gaming,"I bought this mouse to make it easier for me to have the agility I need for the games.  I have to move quickly and I need a mouse that is very sensitive and accurate.  This mouse has been fantastic.  It is super responsive, can handle quick direction changes, all the buttons are easy to press and never get stuck and respond to just the perfect amount of pressure.  The design is super sleek, and I love the colors that helps me use it in the dark when my roomate is sleeping.  I would definitely buy this product again and highly recommend it."
5,Good Hybrid,This game is alot of fun picked it up this morning and played until I had to go to work. Handles like COD4 and reminds me of Diablo II. Will keep you hooked until your console red rings
5,No problems so far,"The only ""problem"" I had was the included ""hinge"" stickers weren't able to really stick to the glass all that well. I would suggest for most users with steady hands to just apply without these stickers. The only suggestion I would have for the manufacturer would be to include a link to a YouTube video to demonstrate, rather than rely exclusively on printed instructions."
1,One Star,dosent work for windows 10
1,Barely lasted 3 months,"They worked fine at first, but after 3 months, I already had to replace it. The prongs on the micro usb side wore down to the point that it was falling out of my controller and not making a connection. And in case its not obvious, this is not from Sony."
1,So far so....meh,"Been playing for a few hours now, have had a few game crashes, graphics of plants and trees go inside buildings and through walls, just seems sloppy, no difficulty settings so its pretty easy sneak, silent kill, sneak push hit in head, repeat, total of about 15 items in the game to scavange for, and only 2 types of food and 2 types of ""throwable distraction"" items, no food or water meter's. Not so much ""survival"" as a test to see how long you can play before you want to quit so if I were gonna rebuy this knowing what i know now...id wait for a sale."
1,Poor quality internal parts,Very poor product. The noise is noticeable and this I can over look. What really bothers me is when you first turn it on the fans scream like the bearings are bad. This tells me why it is so cheap. The fans that are used must be the cheapest around. I have heat sink cooling fans this size on electric cr vehicles that are not this loud. Save your money and avoid this product. The fit and finish is fine but the fans are way below average.
1,2 month wait.,Don't order if youre in the US
4,Haters gonna hate,"It appears as though my enjoyment of this game puts me in the minority.  Oh well  It isn't a common occurrence these days to find a shooter that's built primarily around the single player experience, and despite the inclusion of some coop multi-player, The Darkness 2 is just that.  A single player game, with a well written story, good to excellent voice acting, and an outstanding visual presentation.  The gun play is solid and the darkness powers were a blast front to back.  The story beats include a number of quiet moments and encourages you to spend time talking to the inhabitants of this world.  When was the last time an FPS actually made you give a damn about the peripheral characters?  Regarding length, it took me about seven hours to make it through the campaign, which is about average for most non-RPG's these days.  I understand others are saying five but I suspect those people are just blasting through the game without spending time exploring the world or talking to the NPC's.  That's their choice of course, but playing that way is missing the point entirely.  And the point is this.  The Darkness 2 tells a compelling story, filled with interesting characters.  Also you can tear dudes in half.  So there's that."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,batthery does not fit with the remote and even worse it does not works at all. The worse waste of money of my life. I even try to charge the batteries in the base using tape. DO NOT BUY THIS is a piece of ......
1,Good way to ruin your xbox,"Never worked right out of the box. Concerned that it may have actually damaged the xbox one. Heard a strange noise come from the console the first time I hooked it up. My old power source worked but randomly cut off, now it doesn't work at all."
5,Great price and great screen protector!,Very high quality screen protector. Even for the low price. I would expect to pay around 13 bucks for 3 screen protectors of this quality. Was easy enough to install just like ant other glass screen protector. Im not sure why you would need 3 screen protectors for you switch unless youre really clumsy or numerous people in your family have a switch. Nonetheless great screen protector and i definitely recommend for anyone that own a nintendo switch!
4,Old school gaming,"Great old school gaming system. Only complaint is the wireless controllers that come with the unit are horrible. Got some wired ones off ebay and it now works great. Obviously, the graphics are poor because these are the original games. Not sure why someone would expect more."
1,Don't buy this!!!!,"When I first got myself a PS2 about 2 years ago I made the mistake of not getting a memory card. So I ran back into the store and grabbed the first one I saw. Unfortunately it was this piece of junk. By the time I realized I had to load the software every time I played a game it was too late to take it back to the store. So I just dealt with it until just recently when I bought myself a real PS2 memory card. I also have a pretty good idea that this card and the software caused Jak II to have some glitches including a lockup and a cutscene not playing. So whatever you do don't buy this, just spend the couple extra bucks and buy a regular memory card."
1,Scalping is bad,And so is the selection of N64 games on NSO.
5,Decorative and useful,My husband is a huge Zelda fan and he uses it whenever he plays on his switch. He loves the look of the figurine ad it seems to be well made. It stands up well and doesn't fall over easily. My husband would purchase more of these amiibos if they were available.
1,Scammed by Amazon and nintendo,"Excited for my switch, but I guess nintendo thinks this is a better product."
5,Thanks for the invitation and got mine today.,I got the invite and I just received my ps5 today very happy and glad that you give people the opportunity to get invites for something that is very hard to get.
5,Not bulky,Best charger I've seen and I especially like how it connects to the switch dock. It's not bulky so it really saves on space.
5,Great long cables for long time playing,Works great.  I needed a longer cable for when my controller needed a charge and I didn't want to stop playing.  The short cables that come with the PS4 are useless for anything but charging.
5,This is what's up,"Received mine on March 28, I have to say I'm impressed with the quality and build of this controller. I haven't actually played with it as of yet but I'd expect it to perform as well as it looks. The case is nice even comes with a carry bag and weights you can put inside of the controller which was a great added bonus. Overall very happy with this purchase and with the seller it took approximately 12 business days but he's the real deal"
5,Can't beat the price,"Works great.  Allowed me to connect my Wii to my new Denon receiver through the HDMI port.  Sound and video come through the Surround sound and TV just fine.  I wasn't expecting super fine HD quality from the Wii to begin with, after all it is only a Wii.  But it works for me, the video isn't blurry. I will try switching between the two modes (720 and 1080) and see if there is any noticeable difference."
5,Arrived as expected and works great,Used as a replacement charger for a Nintendo switch... works great!
5,Works great!,Thought I was going to get a cheap piece of plastic stand. I was right but it actually works very well. Fits nice and snug even with the protective case on.
1,poor quality,less than 12 hours after recieving headset the mic is already broken... have now read several reviews now with same problem...seems to be a recurring problem... buy with caution
4,DO NOT INSTALL THE SOFTWARE,good flight stick just do not install the software it will screw with the pinky trigger (On elite dangerous) there are ways around it but so far it has not permanently fixed it.
4,A Must Have For Kinect!,"I just bought this game last night so i havent had extreme amounts of time playing it. But my friend and i played for about 4 hrs last night. I have to say overall this game is very fun. Soccer, volleyball, table tennis seemed to be the most accurate and exciting of the game types. I had trouble with the bowling... mainly getting the sensor had trouble reading exactly where my body was and i also havent figured out how to put any spin on the ball. The only other thing that i would warn against if you buy this game is that if your doing running events like the track stuff in the game, if your floor shakes alot it will throw the sensor off. The vibrations coming through the floor can shake the kinect sensor and give you an error. But other than that this game has been incredibly fun to play. Its really cool to play a game with absolutly no controller!"
5,If you're interested buy it,"Go read a review for undertale. Don't watch a let's play, story is the main draw of this game. If it looks interesting buy it. This port for the switch is excellent, get it and enjoy the weirdness."
5,Great Great seller!,I am a major gamer. i have bought controllers from I'd say 10-15 different modding companies but I keep coming back to geniusmods. They always come through with top quality stuff. My roomates and I have been forming mini modded controller collections and I gotta say I regularly use this one. The gold accents really pop and even though I've had the controller for awhile the buttons and guide have not faded. With other controllers I've gotten the chrome plating rubs off after a few uses but not with this one. On top of that the mods are sick. I dont know if it is actually faster than other modded controllers but I do know that I consistently play better with these guys controllers. My KD is always better and it just feels like the rapid fire is smoother and faster. I've gotten tons of stuff from these guys and I plan on getting some more.
5,Quality collectors edition,"Very nice for Fire Emblem fans. I wish there were a physical cartridge for the game, but I'm okay with having the game digital."
5,Awesome purchase!,Sooooo worth every penny!! Works great!
1,There is a reason they don't make games like this anymore.,"Its not fun. its a hack and slash rpg, without hack and slash or rp. I like to spend what free time I get relaxing and enjoying a good game. I even play most games on difficult the extend the gaming experience, but if you have been gaming the last 15yrs you know what the old Japanese games that only reward you if your cracking out on it 23hrs a day.  If you like fighting your way through a whole level and getting to a boss (with no checkpoint prior i might add. These are required to replenish health and health potions)and having it kill you in one hit, then making you lose all xp and starting you back at the beginning of the level, with all enemies respawned. Oh but they give you the chance to regain your souls(xp) if you can make it back to where you died, without dying again. if you die on your way back you lose it permanently. example: You get mobbed buy 10 plus guys and they relentlessly attack you forcing you to keep up your guard while others throw firebombs at you. your weapons bounce off the wall leaving a lengthy animation while you recover. and making some weapons completely useless in tight spaces. meanwhile your open to attack from all sides, same with your shield getting knocked back.  they have plenty of time to kill you during these unnecessarily long animations.  If you want to spend hours of wanting to throw your controller through your TV, this is your game. it feels like a old school Nintendo game, rigid, unnecessarily difficult, and harsh penalties for the slightest mistake, basically it feels like playing 9hrs of ninja gaiden(the original)and missing a jump and game over. If you want to enjoy the playing experience instead of feeling like your being punished for buying it, Skip it."
1,This software is garbage,"The download service works well enough, but this is supposed to be a LAN game. Enix is forcing you to sign up for an on-line service just to play the freakin' demo! They ruined DSIII as a RPG game, and they have ruined it as a LAN game as well. Further, their internet gaming server software is the most defective garbage I have seen in 20 years. Stay away from this product; it blows!"
2,Cheep is what you get,I recently bought DDR and needed an extra pad so scanning through my options I found this one for around 5 dollars so I thought I would give it a try.  And I got what I paid for.  Half of the time the buttons don't work when you press them so if you are trying to use this mat for points or challenges it isn't worth the time.  The mat slides all over the place while you are using it so you have to stop and adjust it after each song.  But for 5 dollars I shouldn't have expected a great mat.  I don't think I would recommend any one buying this mat since shipping costs more than it does and you are frustrated by the time you finish playing.  I would say just spend a little extra money and get a nicer mat.
5,Best computer golf game out there,"I have been playing the Links LS series for a few years now, and every year the graphics some how get better, as well as the game play. I've played pretty much every other golf game for the PC, and I like this one  the best by far. There are numerous courses you can play, all with amazing  detail and clarity. The players swing motions are just perfect and sharpe.  If you love golf, this is a game should should go out and purchase."
5,Works Great,"I ordered a couple of these and they work perfectly. Good quality. One note: I had tried to pair a controller with the USB plugged in, but it wouldn't pair. It paired as soon as I unplugged it."
1,Poorly Tested Junk,"A factory refurbished product? You'd think they would actually test this before shipping. This controller wouldn't power up and after a closer inspection of the battery enclosure, it's obvious why. There aren't any battery contacts on one side!"
2,Just okay,"Our children love Spongebob, but this game is just okay.  The major drawback on it (and most of the Wii games we've purchased) is that they are advertised as 1-4 player games, when in fact, it's basically a 1 person game with maybe several small games in the main one where you can play more than 1 player.  This is frustrating for a parent that may purchase a Wii game for more than 1 child--and they are expensive!  I wish these manufacturers would start labeling the games more honestly; like ""1 player, with some multi-player options"".  Disappointing."
4,addicted to lego games!,"I love playing lego games.  They are not too complicated - puzzles, lots of smashing and I don't get stuck to the point where I give up on the game.  I wasn't familiar with the legends of Chima storyline which made me think I'd be less interested in playing the game.  But I have to say now that I am on the 4th level, this just may be the best lego game for nintendo ds that I have played (and I've played them all - Harry potter 1 and 2, Pirates, Batman 1 and 2, Lotr, Star wars, clone wars)  It's a little more complicated as it goes along, but that is making it more fun.  So if you like lego games on the DS, you will enjoy this one.  I'm wondering if they didn't put more into this game since they knew people werent just going to buy it for the familiarity of the characters - like the other games."
1,which sucks because you have to let go of the right ...,"It doesn't support IOS except the volume. The controller is similar to a XBox controller, but the quality is much cheaper. If you want to play War Robots on IOS this isn't the controller to buy. However, if you have an Android and want to play War Robots this controller works. The exception is you will have to use the Select and Start buttons if you want to fire your weapons, which sucks because you have to let go of the right joystick to press the Start button to fire on of your weapons. I give it a 1 star because I have nothing but IOS devices."
5,Amazingly powerful and versatile device!,"I'm super happy with this wireless adapter helping to curb my need for different controllers for different platforms. I've tested it with PC, neogeo mini, ps classic, and nintendo switch, all using a ps4 controller flawlessly.  I've also used an arcade fight stick in wired mode with ease as well! I'm definitely a mayflash fan after them providing some solid and well-priced adapters over the years, and they continue to impress after this."
5,Works good!,"Nice, fits joy-cons well.  The only complaint would be the 4 blue lights across the front.  They are way too bright.  They light up my entire living room at night when the lights are out.  In the picture I posted, three lights have a light dimming stricker on them and the first one doesn't."
5,Five star customer service and durable product (works with the note 9 and tab S4 for me),I had a problem connecting the USB-C 4K adapter to my tab S4and use it for my Dex station and hence I had to email the seller of the item within 10 minutes the seller replied and was able to help me out instantly without any problems.I am very very satisfied with this product and also because of the great customer service. FIVE STARS!!!! (You will need a cover for the Tab S4 and if it's the note 9 you'd need to connect your charger... Love this product.)
5,As described.,As described. Thanks.
5,AWESOME!!! these things are the official playstation thumbsticks,"my dog had chewed my thumbstick on my dualshock 3 PS3 controller, and I looked all over the internet for replacement parts and I felt kinda wierd buying them on Ebay since you know they are third party made, so I came onto Amazon hoping I can find them from a trusted seller, and this is what i found, took me 5 minutes to replace them with the new ones, I recommend this to everyone who needs to replace the thumbstick, it's very simple to switch the old for the new.  you get 2 in a pack I got mine all the way from florida in a couple days, I recommend this to everyone looking to save some money, WAY better then buying a whole new controller."
5,i love it family feud,it was great my family is loving it and we are having lots of fun playing together lots and lots
5,Love this game!!!,"I bought this for my grandson and he loves the game.  Very creative and fun to play. The Lego games are well made, very creative, and kids love them.  Hats off to Lego for creating games that are good for younger children.  My grandson is 8 and every Lego game he plays, he loves."
5,Easy to play and TOTALLY addictive,"SIM City 2000 is one of the easiest games on PC to play and it is great fun too.  Build a city from scratch and watch it grow.  With a loan from the bank you can start your own electronic world and you're in charge BIG-TIME.  As your city gets bigger so do the needs of your blossoming population and let me tell you they aren't always to please.  They want schools, hospitals, police and fire departments, libraries and museums and they are also greedy for entertainment such as stadiums, parks and zoos.  To get the money in you have to make the city pay for itself, so taxes are the order of the day, and cutting costs just part of day-to-day living in a SIM world.  You get totally wrapped up in your city, especially as it evolves with time and eventually looks like something out of Star-Trek.  The instructions are easy to follow, and the graphics are chunky and colorful.  The sound effects are pretty neat too, and you get a choice of disasters to inflict on your city if you are feeling especially nasty.  A great game and at a great affordable price too."
1,what a disappointment,"I was bored after 30 minutes of play.  You only get four maps.  No single player space combat.  I really liked the old star wars battle front games, but this is very disappointing.  Graphics are good, but that is all this one has going for it.  If you want more maps and modes to play, you have to buy the expansion pack for 50 bucks."
5,Great quality but package was opened,The cord works perfect for the A40 headset. How the package was already opened apon delivery not torn or by accident it had been cut from one end to the other. Either way at least I got it
2,Crashes Constantly,"Crashes constantly after you've established any type of significant railway network. I can't give this anymore than 2 stars because after a few hours on any map that you play, your game will become bogged down and will not be playable, which ruins the very reason to play the game. Zooming out becomes impossible. Clicking on signals to bring up the signal network results in crashes. Building too much track results in lag and crashes. Highly disappointing."
1,"A big win for ATVI stockholders, not so much for players",A rehash of a 10-year old title with the removal of key features (LAN) and the addition of price gauging.
2,Not worth it.,"Poor construction.  Screen is small. Software is not user friendly.  In order to switch from one game to another, the machine needs to be turned off and back on."
5,Working on Windows 10,"Bought this on a whim to try and get running on my new laptop. Installed quick and the cd key still worked with no problems. Some people elsewhere noted having to download a certain patch to get this to run on Windows 10, I have played several hours with no issues without this patch. We will see how it continues to run, but I am very happy as this may be the best Sims game out there!"
5,Very Nice Looking Keyboard,"I really liked the layout, looks, and design of this keyboard.  The keystrokes were too loud for my taste, so I did not hook it  up.  There are rubber O-rings available to buy online, that dampen the sound.  I received a hassle free refund.  I later learned that ""mechanical keyboards"", are traditionally a bit noisy.  I wish I had plugged it in, so that I could give a better review on its function."
5,Well Worth the Money,"If you have a 4GB XBox 360 Slim, this is a must buy. When playing games from stored memory, the disc drive stays quiet which is really great and theres plenty of memory space for downloaded games and saved games. I wish I had bought it sooner."
4,"Really fun game, perfect for perverts","Really fun game, perfect for perverts. I misread and thought it came with a shinobi STYLUS, but it's actual a syllabus (character bio roster)"
5,Perfect HOTAS for Star Citizen!,"Bought this setup to use in Star Citizen.  Replacing my old Thrustmaster T-Flight Hotas X Flight Stick.  The different is night and day!  For the price, this set is amazing.  Highly recommended!"
1,Try again Lego (well maybe not),"Avoid this game. They did not get it right. First, I could not get it to work on XP. Oh, well. I should have looked more closely at the package. It makes no Windows claims. I did get it to work on Windows 98. But my 9-year old and I had a very slow go at figuring out how to make it work. The graphics are poor. Everything ran slow compared to our other games. (Working with 256MB memory, 32mb video memory, lots of free defragmented disk space.) The help is disfunctional much of the time and extremely slow the rest of the time. Too bad the Harry Potter enterprises did not contract with the Humongous crowd to do this. (Humongous are the makers of Pajama Sam, Freddy Fish, etc.)"
5,Pleasantly surprised!  Works perfect in the US!,"My son wanted this game as a reward for good grades.  I was extremely reluctant to purchase a game at this cost with only foreign reviews.  He said it would work but have Japanese subtitles.  According to my son the game works perfect in the US and he has had no issues with it.  It is the Japanese version so there is no English instructions or English subtitles.  Also the game arrived super fast!  Ordered Friday, received Monday.  Very happy with the purchase."
2,Good for the younger crowd,"For younger kids, this game is probably fun.  It's linear, simplistic, and basic.  I found the dressage controls annoying, as my DS did not seem to understand that an X is an X and an O is an O half the time.  Moving the character around was irritating as well.  She is slow, so it takes forever to walk back and forth between rooms, doing tasks for your friends."
5,BETTER THAN FINAL MOUSE,"This mouse is the one to kill final mouse, with a slightly improved sensor, lighter weight, and affordable cost, it is looking to be there best mouse for even a high tier gamers"
2,Faulty construction,"When my adapter arrived it was actually open - the two pieces don't fit together entirely and there's a corner of it that's always slightly ajar, letting air (or anything else) inside the unit. If I had any faith about the construction of this piece I'd get a replacement, but the whole thing seems so cheaply made that I'd rather just find a different product and throw this one in the garbage. On the plus side...it did actually work for the short time I used it."
5,Cool control,Cool control
1,Dissatisfied,Ordered through All Access. Product showed up defective.
5,This is a game that your kids will play over and over,"You know how you buy games for your kids and after maybe a few weeks they either beat the game or get bored with it? Well, that will not happen with this game. This is a fun never-ending game. Players get to build levels on their own and play online with their friends as well. New levels are built daily. It's muliplayer, so sometimes I join in to play with my children. Up to four people can play. It is fun for all ages. I heard the theme to ""Beverly Hills Cop"" in one of the community made levels, which let me know that I am not the only ""oldie"" around...lol"
5,GOOD MOUSE!,"Overall I really like this mouse. It fits very nicely in my hand and has nice rubber sides that grip well. The mouse lights up and glows different colors, which I really love! I also think that the DPI button is great and I love how when you click it changes the colors of the mouse! The mouse has very nice buttons that all feel good and a scroll wheel that is very nice. One thing that you might want to take in to consideration is that your mouse doesn't really have many other buttons than a normal mouse does, so I don't know if I would call it a gaming mouse. For a hardcore gamer they want a mouse that has fire buttons and other buttons that do other functions that your mouse doesn't have. It says that the buttons are programmable but I was never able to figure out how to do that. Overall great mouse I really loved and have enjoyed it and I think it is very useful. GET THIS MOUSE!"
1,Don't buy from pricks like this.,Scumbag gouging prices to capitalize on a global crisis. I hope no one buys from you and you're sitting on a stockpile of switches you won't know what to do with.
1,"If I buy it, it's Mine; DRM says it's still yours...","... so, no thanks.  It's the principle of the thing.  I'm tired of buying products I don't ""own."""
1,EA screwed me again!,First need for speed was pathetic! This game is AWFUL! No campaign and the gameplay is terrible. So boring.
5,Pro controller? Who the hell would want that?,"Mappable buttons, ability to communicate with friends in games that the idiotic Nintendo switch online app does not support (wish Nintendo would just integrate chat into the system) this controller is a great alternative to that. What's not to like? Ultra comfortable, the blue cammo is a nice touch. Hard wired, don't have to worry about charging or changing out batteries. Wire also has plenty of length. You guys knocked this one out of the park! Hands down greatest switch controller of all time. Illl never use a other as long as this one keeps working."
5,Five Stars,Just as described
1,Junk. Skip this one.,I am sick and tired of having to buy crappy headsets. This thing worked for about 3 months then started making an echo and static issues. It is pretty sad how long this product lasted. Do not buy this unless you want to buy another headset in a few months.
1,NO ONE should buy this.,NO ONE should buy this. The price is so off of what it should actually be. Do the math on the individual items. Do not purchase.
5,Unmatch at this price point. Feels like a 70 dollar controller,"Amazing!! For this price point I was expecting a cheap build, not at all. It has weight to it and feels like a 60 to 70 dollar price range controller. It worked without issue on my AX9 android box (many usb controllers have issues with Chinese android boxes). It worked flawlessly out of the box."
4,Best controller on the planet for the price.,"This is an amazing controller for the price. I am very satisfied with it and for me its exactly what i was wanting, something very similar to the ps3 controller but with a moderate amount of quality. This is not cheap thankfully it feels balanced in between a low cost controller and an actual ps3 controller. The analog sticks are of good quality. It has better response than a sabrent 10 dollar controller and logitech f310 for the same price. Of course its not as accurate as a ps3 but i knew it wouldn't be but was it good enough? Yes for me absolutely i never felt held back by the analog sticks and with other controllers i have noticed huge deadzones. There is a lot more to say about this product it came protected in a nice box and with clear english instructions. It shipped lightning fast and was here in 2 days with free shipping. It does have 2 small flaws that take a star away and make me just like it instead of fully loving it. The l2 and r2 trigger buttons feel a little too big and clunky. They do work fine in general but just feel a bit loose. All the other buttons and very tight and responsive otherwise i probably wouldn't have noticed. Still works fine in game but slightly annoying. The other thing is the led light in the center of the controller is super bright and if you are in the dark its possibly going to annoy you. I put a tiny piece of black tape over it and it doesn't bother me now. Xbox engine also has 2 styles of direct input and instructions explain all of it. What else can i say for me this is the controller i want at the price range i can afford, i would buy again."
5,Shouldn't disappoint,"I played a short demo of this game at E3, and it's a 3-D action-adventure game with its setting in Hogwarts. You enter different classrooms to learn spells, then put those spells to use to solve puzzles. I didn't see what Quidditch looks like, but it'll be in there, too. One of the developers told me the PS version has about 10 times the content of the PC version, since the latter is intended for a younger audience. The Game boy and GBA versions are also completely different games, so that should be interesting."
5,great controller for the price,"This is my 3rd PDP controller.  I'm pretty rough with controllers.  I play racing and fighting games.  What I like about this controller is 1.  The price 2. the software to control the aspects of the controller.  On one of my games, I could not turn off the vibration to the rumblers.  I have issues with my hands where intense vibrations causes my hands to hurt.  Since I couldn't turn off the vibration, ie game settings, I avoided playing the game.  Here comes PDP with their software.  I was able to go into the software settings and turn off the vibration.  No more hurting hands while playing the game. I will continue buying this brand.  If you break one during special ops battling or trying to out run the cops on NFS, these beauties are cheap enough to just buy another one."
5,Great product,Daughter really likes this. Charges joy-con as expected. Not overly bright at night which allows her to sleep.
4,"Recycled Jack, Needs a little work","YDKJOL isn't a bad game. It has more questions then the previous games in the durable PC series, The best host in the game-Cookie-is again at the helm making sure that your quest for game dollars is a sarcastic and smart  allecky one, and those phoney commercials at the end of the game as always  are gold.  So why not 5 stars?  Well this game has got some flaws, but they  all mostly fall in the same catagory.  One is that it takes away from game  4, THE RIDE format, which in my opinion was the best.  THE RIDE helped with  the looping question problem as well as the possiblity that anyone can win  near the end, unlike others where it is sometimes pretty obvious.  But  since this game supposed to be best of the netshow game, it was  unavoidable.  The biggest flaw is the extreme re-use fo older jokes, music  and sound bites from previous games, particularly game 3.  Offline was the  frame to hold the new questions on, for those who do not get the netshow,  but I guess the jokes and sound slipped off the side.  Regardless, Offline  is not a bad game, it is YDKJ, it is still a blast, and if you haven't  played any of the games, it's a good place to start, and veterans will more  then likely want it too.  Those veterans however aren't going to find  anything exciting or new, with the exception of the new Pissed About a  Question feature, a slightly new question type in which angry players who  vented to the company with their frustrations get well, vented back.  Over  all, a good game, but it could have been better."
5,Unreal,This game is absolutely crazy. Love the new animations and feel of the game. Even joker is going to be in it! What else can we ask for
5,Scrabble is now Exciting?,"Scrabble 2 makes the first version look prehistoric in comparison.  The  new version has sound effects, selection of jazz tunes, animated Maven  (computer opponent and Judge), optional board styles, a dictionary and  suggestion lists.  I never wanted to play the original board game but now I  do and its a lot of fun.  Great game for kids and adults.  You will  definitely learn some new words.  Scrabble is finally fun!  Definitely get  this one, dont make the mistake of buying the first version, unless you  still have Windows 95.  It is slow and you must change color displays if  you have 98.  If your into word games, you must own this!"
5,Give it a chance!,I bought this game before there were any reviews. Once I started playing I was like other reviewers and was like WTF it won't go any faster then 6-7mph. But like another reviewer mentioned timing is everything. Now when I bowl I've been scoring anywhere between 140-170. Here is what I have been doing. First make sure the PS3 eye is waist high so not on top of your tv put it below it. Next when I'm ready to bowl I hold the move controller straight up and down so the the glowing ball is on top. Next I hit the trigger button then the bowler starts moving forward. Once the player just about reaches the lane I swing back and forward letting go and adding a carve as needed and I consistently through 17-20.5mph.  Once you get the timing right this game is a lot of fun. I went from throwing a game of 50 to now throwing a 170. So give it a chance and practice.
5,Like it,Just a easy readable accessible way to store unused games. Comes of easy to. I Could see it being a pain if your using just one charge plug but I'm not so I never remove it.
1,Not worth the money,Talks about 1-4 players on the back of the case but when the game is started it only allows multi-player via online. What looked to be a family game is basically a single player game.
1,does not fit dsi-xL,"Does NOT fit DSi-XL, despite the description. Should have looked more closely at the return policy, since the cord is not returnable. What a waste of money. My original cord is the gray one on the right. It is CLEARLY a not the same as the one on the left I received. VERY unhappy!!"
1,Hidden Staircase a Hidden Ripoff!!!,"I purchased this game as a gift; the person I gave it to completed the game in 1.5 hours.  The graphics look great in the game, and appeared to have a lot of potential.  But basically, as Nancy Drew, you spend your time getting lists of missing items from 8 different characters, walk around the mapped estate both indoors and outdoors, find the 5 or 6 items on the list to complete that list.  After doing so, you go to the attic of the mansion where the game proceeds to solve itself for you.  This game was a huge disappointment to my 'giftee'; if you are going to purchase a Nancy Drew game for the DS, I recommend either of the following:  The Deadly Secret of Olde World Park or The Mystery of the Clue Bender Society, which give the player the ability to use deductive reasoning and to solve numerous puzzles throughout."
1,Wasted 50 dollars,Code did not download the game. I cannot get it to download from the MS store either as it says code has already been redeemed. Wasted 50 bucks. Never doing digital download again
2,Not worth it.,Got it today and to be honest it looks and feels very cheap. at the very least it looks like it shouldn't be 10 dollars and more like 4 dollars at the most but I guess what we are paying for is the animal crossing picture and not so much the card folio.
5,By FAR the best game I've ever played!,"This game is so amazingly wonderful!  I totally thought I was going to hate it when I first turned it on.  It looked too complicated and I assumed the learning curve would be high.  However, within minutes I was hooked.  And I played it for several months.  This game is a two disc game and the first disc lasts FOREVER!  The second disc is a bit disappointing, length-wise, but the game overall is phenomenal.  Now I have got to get my hands on the original Super Nintendo game.  The story line in Chrono Cross is so intricate and well thought out, I assume a great deal of it connects to Chrono Trigger as well.  I am so blown away by this game there are not even enough words to describe it.  I am sure every game I play from here on out will pale in comparison.  I wish I could play this game forever!  If you are an RPG lover, you have got to play this game.  It can not be missed!  And you will not be disappointed."
5,Conflict: Desert Storm II,"Desert Storm II is unique due to the fact that you operate a small team of four elite soldiers both in single player mode or in multi-player mode.  One by one, you have to select and move your soldiers into position.  Soldiers have access to a large variety of weapons and can swap items between one another.  What I like most about this game is that the weapons operate as they would in real life.  For example, if you plant a C-4 explosive and then detonate it when you are close, you will kill yourself.  Novices will love the machine gun options.  You can adjust the gun settings for semi-auto, fully auto, and grenade launch (for guns equipped).  Skilled players will love the sniper rifle, which has the capacity to zoom in on an enemy even from great distances.  It seems that anything that is possible in real life, is also possible in this game.  You will never find yourself saying, ""Why can't I...I should be able to..."" Each mission offers a new style of excitement. You will face off against infantry, tanks, helicopters, and you will defuse or blow-up weapons of mass destruction.  This game offers challenge without the frustration. I recommend playing the ""training"" sessions before going into war.  The training sessions will teach you how to operate the weapons and all their advanced features.  I would highly recommend this game for a teenager or more mature player due to the level of strategy and realism.  Adult players will be satisfied.  This game is worth every penny."
1,No original packaging???,Extremely disappointed. This item is intended to be a gift but was not delivered as pictured. No original packaging. It was packed in a white envelope. For all I know it could be a used product. DO NOT BUY!!!!!
5,Hours and hours of entertainment,"You really get your Monet's worth. Lots of exploration and storytelling. Action is just so-so, but it is a beautiful looking game with a nice story that is perfect for people who appreciate exploring more than shooting."
1,The game is an unbearable boring grind unless you pay,Micro transactions kill the game. The game is an unbearable boring grind unless you pay. Do not buy!!
5,The best NES game of all time on the GBA,"Regarded by many as the best game to ever grace the original NES, Super Mario Bros. 3 gets shrunk down for the GBA, and it is all the more glorious all these years later, even on the small screen.  Featuring re-vamped graphics and sound effects with the tried but true side-scrolling Mario fun, Super Mario 3 is every bit as fun as it was years ago.  Fans who remember the classic game will remember the innovative power ups introduced here: the raccoon leaf, the frog suit, and plenty more as you take on Bowser's children and the Hammer Bros. as well as the usual cast of Mario villains.  The level design has yet to be beat, and despite a few frustrations that are common place in the Mario series, the game is still a blast to play.  All in all, Super Mario Bros. 3 is a must own for GBA owners and DS owners alike, and it's still one of the best platformers ever made."
2,Over too fast,Bought this for my 12-year old daughter.  She played it off and on for 2 days and completed it.  Maybe a grand total of 5 hours.  Not worth the money.  An average 5-year old could complete it in less than a week.
1,Hard pass,"Nothing is more frustrating, and boring than having to respawn and start from the beginning everytime you died."
4,We love it... like real bowling alley conditions.,If you really bowl or have ever been in leagues then this is the game for you.  It mimics the oil conditions and the gradual change of the lanes.  So no more throwing the bowling ball the exact way and getting a strike each and every time.  We love it... we still love the one that comes with the Wii... but that is a kiddie version.  This one is for when you grow up LOL.  Again... a great game especially if you catch it on sale the way I did when it was pre-ordered.  If you enjoy bowling then you will enjoy this game.
1,faulty product,it doesn't all work with msfs 2020 even though it all is supposed to work!  don't buy from this vendor!!  too prohibitive to ship back!!  no more asian products for me
5,Good for gaming,Bought for husband. Said quality was good but headband fit weird.
1,This for two right! how much for one?,"the price is ,wow, I can wait"
5,Great service,"This is such a cool affordable, let's call it a toy. I have now been around the world I have been skydiving flying mountain climbing all the things that I cannot do due to physical restrictions and I did it all from the comfort of my living room. Such great graphics and just mind-blowing quality and VR content available. Haven't spent money on games yet but soon to come. I had a problem with the objects being a little blurry and a discoloration on my first set but without question or reservation I made a note of it and I was promptly sent a new Oculus. Can't be happier with the service I received and it's just absolutely mind-blowing fun for a very reasonable price. And the initial intro, they have some silly things to get you acquainted with the controls, I spent almost 5 hours just playing alone in that area."
5,8Bitd makes quality products,"that are on par with the likes of original Nintendo, Xbox, Sega, etc. controllers.  Have bought them before and will most likely buy 8bitdo equipment again.  Can typically survive a rage quit within reason.  Not that I ever do that.  :)"
4,Not much new but a solid improvement over 2001.,"The game is pretty much the same as 2001 except for a few minor changes here and there. The graphics look slightly better, the Ai covers the pass better and is harder to burn, Coaches are now more active in the game and are more individual (Tony Dungy won't be as emotional as other coaches, etc)there's now cheerleaders, The madden card system is a little more advanced with different kinds of packs and new cheats and classic players, you can create teams, etc. About the 3 versions the Gamecube will be inferior due to a smaller memory card (I think I read that in 2003 it will be fixed) while the Xbox and PS2 will be pretty close. Also personally i think madden 2k2 is better then Sega NFL 2k2, but Sega still has that unrealistic arcade feel which some prefer over Madden."
5,Best Basball game of 2005,"This game is very impressive.  The fielding, pitching, baserunning and hitting are all so smooth.  Turning the double play is a thing of beauty and pitchers actually matter.  The graphics are even amazing, every player has his stance and facial look. The stadiums are also incredible.  Don't believe any bad reviews of this game, you must try it out if you care about a realistic game in any way.  I have played MVP and 2k5 and MLB ""06 destroys them in graphics, realism and fun.  This has all the behind the scenes greatness of Madden ""05 but for baseball. This is a must have for any old fashioned baseball purist."
5,Best earbuds around and look very unique,"I have tried the Sony WF-1000XM4, the Momentum TW3, and ended up returning both due to issues I had with sound or microphone quality.  These are great as they have great quality in both, (people both in video games and on the phone remarked on the upgraded sound of my headset after I switched).  These buds really blew the other two out of the water there.  They do need to be aligned correctly in you ear for best results (I know this sounds strange, but true) as they have an oval speaker into your ear, you need to almost ""lock"" them into your ear.  They will most likely be pointing more down than forward, but this provides a great seal and isolates the sound better.  In addition, these have a wonderful soundstage for TWS buds (I honestly do not know what other reviews are comparing these too, they are obviously not going to beat a pair of 2000 dollar wired headphones, and they aren't trying to).  Now for the ASE mode:  ASE lets you reduce lag and increase quality on devices like your PS5, Nintendo switch, or PC.  This also comes with 3 profiles: gaming, movies, and music.  All 3 profiles are pretty solid, and the Sound quality is markedly better IN ASE mode, and lag is not noticeable.  I love these earbuds and will use them both in the office and for gaming."
5,Brain Spa Delivers,"I am an older lady who began having memory problems, but I was determined to keep my mind in shape.  Initially, I wasn't sure Brain Spa was what I wanted.  I couldn't visualize the idea of a town being the basis for brain therapy, but since Brain Spa arrived, I have enjoyed it tremendously.  It does NOT make you feel like a 5th grader.  The games are not hokey.  In fact, each ""business"" is a challenge and I am improving daily.  There are many extras that you earn as you improve.  Scores are kept track of and even plotted on a graph.  Brain Spa is a wonderful therapy tool.  And it works!"
1,Very upset!,"Product came in packaging that looked used - it was taped together and had no back packaging. Also, it didn't have a license key, so I can't use it at all. Do not buy!"
1,Do Not Buy,"Check Obsidian's forums and you will discover that almost everyone, particularly if you have an nvidia graphics card, experiences massive frame rate loss and other bugs with this game. The loss in frame rate during combat makes the game unplayable. It doesn't matter how powerful your system is. It is possible that they will be forced to address this and release a patch, but until then, do not support this defective, untested software. In what industry besides the gaming industry is it acceptable to sell a broken product?"
5,"If you play golf, this is the winter game for you",Great game to replace Rory
1,Only 2 hours of battery life do not buy,I am an avid retro game collector and keeping good batteries for some systems has become very hard. The original Game Boy Advance battery should last 7-10 hours this poor Chinese model lasts 2 hours at most. More intense games about and hour and a half. This is better than the Ebay battery I bought last month but I have yet to find a good replacement battery for the GBA SP but there is no point in wasting your money on this one.
5,Works well for PS4 Remote play,Works well for PS4 remote play.  Also offered vibration function.  Great product.
5,Absolutely love this game and I am glad to have it ...,Absolutely love this game and I am glad to have it now with the Xbox one edition. The steel book case is a nice collector type item and is the same as the special edition including all the expansions for Skyrim but with a fancy case.
5,Fine ending to a series,The end of the game might be a dissapointment. But overall this is one of the best games on the 360 by far.  A fine ending to the best rpg series since Baldurs Gate.
1,"A Bad, Unfinished, Soulless Game","If you are expecting a return to Battlefield roots with this title, you will be disappointed. Most mechanics that have made the series wildly successful have been taken out. The UI has been badly redesigned (again), and the amount of bugs and glitches is truly staggering. You need insane hardware to even run this game and even then your machine will struggle in terms of both CPU and GPU. Technical issues aside, the game is simply not good. I put in about 40 hours this week in the early access and then got a refund. Very sad to see such a good franchise sink so low. EA quite literally ruins everything it touches."
1,One Star,Such an over-hyped and over-priced console.
4,Fun but a Hassle,I enjoy playing Scrabble with my wife or playing against the computer by myself.  What I hate is having to put the disk in every time I want to play.  You have to keep re-registering.
1,unplayable broken mess.,"This game is completely broken on PlayStation 4. You cannot even get into a game. Fix this dice. If you ever do actually get into a game, it is quite fun, but that is a very big if."
5,MS Sidewinder Force Feedback 2 works good with Windows XP,"I have seen some of the negative reviews on how the Force feedback 2 works with Windows XP.  My experience has been just the opposite. The joystick works very well with Windows XP. I followed directions and installed the software first. This took about 15 minutes, if you don't include registration. Then, I plugged the joystick into a USB connection, tested the buttons. They all worked, and then I plugged in the power. I am using it with Microsoft flight Simulator 2002, and it works perfectly every time.  KUDOS TO MICROSOFT."
1,No disk drive!,How am I supposed to play my N64 game without a built in disk reader... worthless
1,3 hours on hold with customer support,I ordered the game from Amazon and downloaded it np. Played for 3 days just fine. It was just starting to get fun. Next thing I know I try to start the game up and it says my activation code has been banned. WTF? I looked on UBISofts forums and there are several people who say that the same thing has happened to them because they downloaded the game from Amazon. They also say that they had to call customer support for UBISoft in order to get it turned back on. I've been on hold for 3 hours when they finally picked up and immediately hung up on me. UBISoft has no regards for their customers especially if they purchased a game from Amazon.
4,Pretty good for the price,"Easy to put on and take off. It doesn't fit into the dock with it on, but the case is easy enough to take off that I don't mind it. I love how the joy-cons can be separated from the console. My left joy-con case came with a little scratch on it, but I'm ok with that. Seems like a decent case so far. I'll update eventually with how it's held up."
1,VERY BAD product for the Wii.  Don't buy it for the gun or wheel.,"The gun from this kit does not work with the Wii.  It's supposed to trigger the ""B"" button on the wiimote, but it doesn't move far enough to trigger the ""B"" button.  I was trying to use it on a few shooting games which fire via the ""B"" button.  It was disappointing.  Also, the steering wheel needs better engineering.  At least the official wheel from Nintendo has a little space for the wrist strap to go through.  This wheel did not and it was hard to shove the wiimote in and out of the steering wheel as the tiny extra space the wrist strap needed kept getting caught.  I would recommend looking for other wii guns or steering wheels, even if you have to pay a little extra."
5,She said she likes it and it works good. No complaints from her,"I got this for my daughter's gaming habit. She said she likes it and it works good. No complaints from her. I will complain that she can't hear me anymore when I call her down to help me with dinner, so I'm assuming it's pretty good sound quality. Either that or selective hearing."
5,Death stranding limited edition console,Console and controller looks amazing!
1,This is against Runescape TOS,This needs to be removed from Amazon....
5,"The audio is great, the software to control the sound is easy ...","This headset is incredible.The audio is great, the software to control the sound is easy to use. I have been using them to play for hours and they are incredibly comfortable and the connection has never dropped once. The microphone sounded really good according to my friends and the fact that you can easily mute yourself with the swivel mic is really nice. I highly recommend this product."
5,Saves money,Great product. We were able to refrain from wasting money on batteries and use the rechargeable station. Easy to use and effective
5,A Good GTA Fix for those with a Switch.,"If you are like me and have a need to play a somewhat similar Grand Theft Auto Game in Handheld mode then this is the game for you. Having spent at least two hours on this game and doing a couple of missions as well as some roaming I have experienced no lag whatsoever, no frame drops and no glitches. Every cutscene plays as if you were playing on the 360 on PS3 as well as the gameplay. If you are on the fence on buying this game I would suggest that you give this game a try because this game truly is good."
5,WII remotes,The customer service with this company is amazing. I needed help setting up my WII remotes and the gentleman that helped me was very very nice I appreciate everything you did for me
5,The best Switch stand available.,"Works exactly as advertised, zero complaints here!"
1,Disappointing,"For a game that took 10 years to make, this is incredibly disappointing. Even on proud mode, the combat is repetitive and easy. The Frozen world is dull and has nothing interesting to see while exploring. The 100 Acre Wood world is completely unfinished and just a few mini-games (Thank you Chinese Government). The Toy Story world feels like it goes on forever. Yes, the graphics and animation is better and they've managed to retain most of the same voice actors (though some of them sound completely uninterested), but the story goes nowhere and it feels like a Disney game that features Kingdom Hearts characters, as opposed to the other way around."
5,A Fantastic Ship Pack Expansion For A Fantastic Game!,"Wow!  This Imperial Class Star Destroyer packs a lot of punch into your Star Wars: Armada game.  First of all, the model is just beautiful, and is quite a big bigger and more powerful than the Victory Class Star Destroyer that comes with the base game.  Like that earlier Star Destroyer, this one is powerful up front but weak in the rear, so watch those Rebel ships that manage to get behind you.  That said, there is a hardly a ship that could withstand the full brunt of its forward batteries at close range, throw into it a concentrated fire command and there is no ship more lethal in the game.  Add on top of that more ship cards and upgrades, which brings even more fun to your tabletop.  If you enjoy playing Star Wars: Armada, this expansion ship pack is a must own!"
5,Love it,I so very very very very love my sky landers figurines and now I got all three of the series this particular this sky lander
5,Works great.,"I needed this to power my Nintendo game boy advance so I could play so,e Metroid.  This worked perfect and I am now playing"
5,It feels good. it's of good quality.,"Very good, playing games with good friends, using the handle to play games is much more comfortable than the computer, the hand feels very good, there is no delay effect, it is very comfortable to play, I also like the color very much and the appearance is particularly beautiful, at all Does not stick to sweat. Recommended"
5,This new Kinect works soooo much better than the one for the Xbox360,This new Kinect works soooo much better than the one for the Xbox360. I was beyond impressed. Biggest change I noticed immediately was that the sensor adapted for a small space much better than the previous version. I have a very small living room and the old sensor needed the user to stand farther back to be able to pick the person up. This one worked in the smaller space and worked perfectly!
1,Horrible Ripoff,"This bundle is severely overpriced, and they don't offer free returns if you realize you paid too much.  Disgusting."
1,Be aware - No tournament mode in the ps4 version,no tournament mode!!!??? wtf you playing at EA?! this game has been ruined without this mode ! waste of money and a downgrade from the ps3 version :( will be selling this on ebay
5,Love the stand,Love the stand. Keeps my PS4 cool. My PS3 died from overheating so I'm a little cautious with my new console. The charging ports are great and keeps everything together. The pads for the controllers are a little difficult to get on at first but protect the pads. Would recommend.
1,WARNING ABOUT THE BLU RAY FEATURES...NO AUDIO COMMENTARY!,"I love this movie but...well in another cash grab Disney released this blue ray and falsely claims it has ""cast and crew commentary"" ...well it doesn't. You can play the movie in an annoying mode where sometimes facts pop up, sometimes sketches are shown, and some people randomly talk IT'S ANNOYING and stupid. I was hoping for some actual interviews with ANYONE from the cast and an actual informative commentary with ANYONE involved but nope. This is the same old release they have had us buy on vhs, dvd, anniversary dvd and now blue ray. UGH. The ""featurette"" is a whopping 4 minutes long. This blu ray doesn't even have the trailer!"
5,"Do Not Buy From Amazon, Buy On NIS Store","NIS America does wonderful collectors editions, but I discovered it was on Amazon and figured I'd get it there while I was already on Amazon, which was a mistake because they don't take the care for packaging them that NIS America does. I would recommend you buy this on the NIS America store instead if you don't want it to be damaged or beat up."
1,Un-Aligned Graphics,"I just bought this and immediately upon starting the game I noticed that the mouse pointer is not lined up with the buttons. You have to be an inch to the left and two inches above the link you want to click on, making it almost impossible to function in the game. I am very disappointed with this purchase and do not recommend anyone else buy it."
1,Defective,"The console was defective. Microsoft's service is below mediocre and they expected me to pay for shipping for a replacement with no reimbursement. Luckily, Amazon is reliable."
4,"Fun, if familiar, puzzle blast","The minute you pop Planet Puzzle League into your DS, you'll automatically feel familiar with the game's overall gameplay aspects.  If you've played games like Columns or even the original Puzzle League, you'll feel right at home here.  Despite it's familiar aspects though, Planet Puzzle League still offers a good amount of fun for your DS.  Using the stylus and touch screen allows you to manuver your blocks around to set up chain reactions, and actually gets old after a while thanks to the fact that there are no real rewards to earn the further you advance in the game.  The real meat of Planet Puzzle League lies in the multiplayer and online options, which are second to none.  Going head to head against another player is oh so much fun, and the Wi-Fi and online capabilities of the DS shines as you play against other players all over the world works surprisingly well, and when using the DS headset, you can even chat with your opponents.  What kills Planet Puzzle League from being something really special is the game's overall gameplay elements, which we've seen before, and seen done better.  That being said though, most of Planet Puzzle League is a great blast to play with the real meat and potatoes being found in the multiplayer options of the game, and for that alone it is worth checking out."
5,Great wireless headset!,"I teach online ESL classes and have been teaching for almost 2 years with a super cheap headset, so I decided it was time for an upgrade. I have been using these for about 2 weeks now and love them. They have great sound quality and they're comfortable through 4 hours of teaching. Battery life is great too! Haven't had any problems so far with the battery dying and I like that you can still use them plugged in if you forget to charge them. The ear covers go completely around my ears without smooshing them. Usually gaming headsets look comically large on my head, so I like the slim profile of these. Definitely recommend so far!"
4,First-rate RPG goodness,"This inexpensive, simple little Diablo clone is a first-rate time-waster RPG for those who want a simple stress-reliver to while away an hour or two.  It is essentially Diablo 1 with a much deeper dungeon and the shift from a class-based RPG to a skill-based one.  It also adds the rather entertaining feature of having a pet that morphs into a killer monster-companion by feeding it select species of fish.  Graphically, Fate is a slight improvement over the Diablo games with full 3-D scrollability and a more cartoonish look.  But at its heart, it is just Diablo 1 with some nice additions.  If you want solo dungeon crawling fun with no danger of multiplayer exploiters ruining your fun, look no further."
5,Enjoyable update to a wonderful classic,"Prince of Persia 3D is a great update of Prince of Persia. It offers state-of-the-art graphics, wonderfully atmospheric music, and extensive gameplay, while maintaining the flavour of the original. The way the prince  moves is a delight. There's loads of flexibility in difficulty levels,  making it playable by inexperienced as well as experienced gamers, and you  can adjust the gore level as well. As one who suffers from dizziness when  playing close-up 3D games (such as the Doom-style shooters), I was  delighted to find that the 3D perspective in Prince is not so close up,  making it very comfortable to play. My one complaint is that the game load  times are very long. Despite that, it's well worth buying."
5,"Love the keyboard, mouse was a pleasant surprise","Love, love LOVE my new clickity clack keyboard. Was not thinking I was in the market for a new mouse (I am a writer, not much of a gamer) but I was happily surprised with the tactile sensation of the heaviness of it. This is my first mechanical keyboard since 'the old days' when they were standard, and after a month of use, I still get a little giddy when I am typing up a frenzy. Love the responsiveness and noise. Husband not terribly impressed with racket it makes, but he didn't like the quieter one either. If you've got a roommate to annoy and you do a lot of typing, this is a gem!"
5,Nice product,My family luvs this. Makes you feel like you are really playing
4,You might have to do some system setting work to get it to work...,"After some work with the settings of my Windows 7 Machine, it started working.  Initially, I couldn't get the video to work when attempting to run."
4,G-PAK - Not too bad; but could be better,"I just received the G-PAK today. After loading my gear into the bag; it just does'nt fit all my gear. It will only hold 2 Nintendo style controllers, other brands were too big to fit. Even the 2 Nintendo controllers were very hard to fit into the tight pocket. So if you have more than two controllers you will need a bigger bag. With the console loaded it will not allow you to change games without undoing the velcro strap that holds it in. This strap is also the only way the console is held into place in the bag. It has room for 16 games without the cases. It stores them in a caselogic style holder built into the bag. Not a bad idea for older kids, but younger kids will get the discs loaded with fingerprints and scratches taking the games in and out of this holder. The flap on bottom that you use to access the hookups is secured by velcro, which will just wear out over time. Overall, it's not a bad bag. But it could have been designed better. I think a bag or case that is bigger with a few more pockets would be a better choice. But for the price it's not a bad buy."
5,AN ABSOLUTE MUST HAVE FOR THE SIMS 3 USER,"Sims 4 is an awesome game and an absolute must-have for Sims 3 users. The performance of The Sims 4 is great and it is almost light-speed faster than Sims 3 and much smoother. Mods will not affect the performance of The Sims 4, so mod it up! The packs you get in Origin are good, so add them to The Sims 4!"
5,"Worked great with Nintendo Switch, easy to connect",I was hesitant to purchase an off brand controller for our nintendo switch but I also didnt want to invest too much (since my kids have a history of being rough on their electronics). I was pleasantly surprised by this controller. Serves it's purpose and I don't have to cringe when I hear it fall off the table by accident!
5,I haven't rage-quite yet!,"A long time ago I played Shiren the Wanderer which was possibly on the DS.  I was thinking maybe the GBA but I don't see it anywhere.  At any rate, I love these types of rogue like dungeon crawlers, fighting through Izuna, the Unemployed Ninja, and cruising through the Pokemon Dungeon games.  However, with Shiren, it was one of the few games I'd rage-quit on.  I vowed never to play it again.  So what happened?  I suddenly find myself with the new Shiren and I'm actually enjoying it alot.  Here's the difference between the two...the old one was so brutal (as I remember it anyway) that I could never even get out of the dungeon with an upgraded weapon.  I felt I made zero progress time after time.  Izuna was hard, but Shiren was harder.  I watched part of the walkthrough on YouTube for the new Shiren and it convinced me to give it another go.  This time there are so many things to help you.  There is a lot of storage, there's the capability of getting items to revive you every time you start over (from the Points Card guy) and there are things to help you acquire items in the extra Dungeon and Puzzle house.  Plus you start from a good place from the Training house with some items.  You can hire help and bank money to give you an upper hand.  So this version is completely different from the last one I played.  I don't feel so hopeless when I die.  Though you have to be kind of a masochist to play these games anyway, and have great patience, as I've aged (56 now) I feel that I don't have infinite time to play one game.. Shiren really makes you feel like you've accomplished something which encourages one to keep going.  I've made it through the first small dungeon and the three (Past, Present and Future) other preliminary dungeons, I feel really good about the game.  In conclusion, it's a great game with lots of goodies to keep you going and has beautiful graphics."
1,"What the heck were u thinking, no packaging","This review is about how the product was shipped.  Unless I made a complete mistake I was buying a used very good condition.  I can live without the original packaging but as u can see from the picture they dumped the equipment loose in a box twice as large as need and put absolutely nothing in to protect it not even a air pillow.  Picture is from the moment I opened the box, the head set seems fine but the infrared modules are very scuffed up.  I'm.going to see if the scuffs effect anything and I need to take a close look at the lenses.  Right tnow I'm very un happy"
5,Good,Just as described
1,SecuROM ? you have to be kidding.,I seriously had this game in my cart and was about to buy it when I found out that it comes with SecuROM. Oh well.
4,Freaky but Fun,"This game was probably one of the scarier Nancy Drew games. The graphics are still amazing and the features are new and improved! In this game, Nancy gets to have a PDA (personal digital assistant) that she takes around with her. It's a phone book and notebook. Nancy jotts down important notes and such in it and this time, you don't have to scroll ALL THE WAY DOWN to look at the new stuff she wrote (unlike the previous Nancy Drew game). It's really scary in the beginning and in other sections too. You have to snoop around at night and go to the graveyard! I'd say it is pretty freaky. But it's loads of fun. I only got stuck really bad ONCE during the entire game. That doesn't mean it's super easy but it just means that it's not extremely hard to the point where you can't figure it out yourself. This one was one of the better Nancy Drew games!"
5,Finally completed my collection,"With this broadband controller, I now own four GameCubes, four copies of Mario Kart Double Dash, four broadband adapters and 16 GameCube controllers. My gaming club will be very excited about this because next week, we're going to be playing LAN with all the above hardware."
2,"This is NOT the ""Complete Invasion Collector's Set""","I would have given this set 5 stars if it had been correctly described. This is not the ""Complete Invasion"" set but is the ""Complete Animated Series"" set, the difference being in the lack of any extra features. At this time the product description and images are NOT what you will get. If you don't mind having the set without special features, this is the only currently produced Zim set available on the market at this time and is of excellent quality. My only other complaint is with the CD cases--they are inadequate for shipping and several of the discs in the set were loose in their cases and had been lightly scratched by the time they were received. Happily, the scratches did not seem to affect the playback of the discs."
1,Overpriced garbage,"Garbage, getting a pc and joining the master race."
1,I got ripped off.,"I believed the hype! Whether you play the campaign solo or coop it is way to difficult (not fun) even on easy. Aiming feels wrong, you can't take cover and unless you are an operative, you can't see mines! I strongly encourage you to stay away from this game. It is the definition of frustration."
2,Received non-functioning unit.,"System turns on, but does not display a video signal. The light bar pulses blue and stays that way. System will not boot into safe mode either. This issue occurs on every HDMI cable, port, and display I have tried."
1,This online game is now shut down.,"The Auto Assault servers shut down as of the end of August 2007. With no single-player capability, this game will no longer function."
5,Awesome,Great product
4,Fix support flaw,"The product is very nice and I like the design of it. The only downfall to the product that stopped it from getting a 5 star rating was the support screw that comes with it, isn't long enough to attach the system to the docking station. So you're not going to get that extra support holding your system upright. Pretty big flaw of you want that extra support, but overall I am very happy with it. I still bought another one for my sons"
2,early reviews,"It annoys me that people continually write reviews for games that they have never even played or seen. Hhow do you know the game is going to be good? Take a look at the reviews below and you'll find text like ""GTA 3 was cool so i ASSUME this will be too. I've never played it or seen any screen shots, but it will be awesome so I am giving it five stars based on nothing other than gta3."" You realize that it affects the overall customer review average, and if the game comes out and isn't that great, the review average will be higher than what it should be because of people writing reviews way too early. Wait until the game comes out and you've played it to give your opinion on it. It makes no sense in wasting people's time and possibly money by doing this. I myself believe this game will be great and i will buy it as soon as it comes out, but i am not going to give it a 5 star rating just because i think that...what's the point?"
1,BEWARE! IT'S NOT THE ITEM PICTURED,"Note what arrive has ""120 games"", but the item pictured clearly reads ""130 games"".  Very Smarmy!  I considered a better valued  product, but thought I might pay a bit more for extra games.  What I got was bate and switch. So why imagine the device  even works at all?  I may give it another star if it actually functions properly for more than a week.  Get it someplace else."
5,"Great game. On time, very fast delivery.",Great graphics like the added extras
4,"Game good, but Amazon shipping sucks","Somehow the cartridge survived but the steel book case is totaly destroyed, it was in one of those flat bubble wrap plastic bag packages and something heavy crushed it hard. The case cannot close at all. Makes me sad"
4,OLE TIMES,The system looks great. It works perfect but a lil on the cheap side when it comes to the feel of the controllers but well worth the price.
5,Great,Better than I imagined. My kids will love it on christmas
5,The shocker!,"These performed beyond my expectations. The simulated 7.1 in the headset worked perfectly with the PC and my PS4 pro. My friends told me i was more clear on this headset then the PS4's gold headset which is what i  normally use on a daily bases. These are more comfortable and the sound quality is phenomenal for the price. I have actually stopped using the sony's headset because this one give me more comfort, sound clarity, and the simulated bass in the headset. The control button is a little larger then what is needed, plus its corded is my only problem but those are personal dislikes. But those are small, compared the amazing aspect of owning this beauty."
1,Nothing but junk.,"When connecting the controller to the base station, there are times where you have to jiggle the controller around in order for the contacts to touch so your controller can charge. The base station feels sturdy but the contact that connects the controllers seems cheap and crappy."
5,Must have for a quest 2,"I wasn't too sure about how the product would be when I bought it. A Youtuber that goes by GetHip had a long list of recommendations for quest 2 accessories with him regarding Kiwi as a very trusted brand. Boy am I glad I listened. The silicone feels very nice to the touch, helps keep the edge of your face (slightly) cooler when playing, and blocks out that annoying light by the edges of the nose. Never realized how much that light bleed ruined my immersion until now. I also bought the controller grips with handsfree straps, and the pop in back-of-the-head piece for the headstrap. I've had no issues so far and I genuinely enjoy every penny I've spent. The lens covers pop in and out very easily and have had no issues with them. I actually just put velcro on them and the top of my headset for safe storage while I'm playing. All in all, 5 stars guys."
1,Input lag,Noticeable input lag on switch. Would not recommend for Smash
1,Not worth the wait or money,"Well after waiting 13 hours in line I finally got the system. First let me say the graphics are no better the the x-box 360, second this box gets hot, I mean fry an egg on it hot. I don't know if there's something wrong with it or this is normal but you can't touch the unit after playing for an hour or so. I'm very disapointed. It doesn't play my playstation 2 games, the graphics still look cartoonish and it does freeze up from time to time. The only plus is the blue ray drive which can play hi-def movies. My take on this is save your money and either go with the XBOX -360 or wait for the prices to come down. It's not worth the money at all."
1,I've played Ultima Online for 4 years...,"Let me make this short and sweet.  I have played UO since it started and have many longtime friends in game.  That being said, we all have UO3D from the beta testing cd and NONE, NO ONE, ZILCH of the people i know use the Third Dawn version for regular gameplay.  Its buggy, laggy, everything moves slow, the 3d graphics are blah for the most part.  Its a joke.  I would uninstall it if not for the fact that the new land mass Ilshenar is only accessible through UO3d. UO Renniasance is the game interface everyone uses to play UO, at least everyone I know and play with.  UO-Third Dawn is a joke."
1,Sad that I had to download the pirate copy to have the game work,"Yes, I bought the game. I also own it on 360. Unfortunately, securom does not see my cd driver (I have a blu-ray burner). Therefore I am unable to play the game. But the pirated copy works just fine. When will companies realize that DRM is obsolete?"
5,Works great and is very responsive,Bought to make my office job more stylish! It really is quiet. It's kind of crazy. No click at all! Works great and is very responsive. The instructions are not written by native English speakers but who cares. Just plop a battery in it and plug it in!
1,i thought it was good????,"I REALLY gave this game a chance, but it failed to live up to all the talk i heard.  I finished it and couldnt help but feel bored.  the ending (is)so bad, from beginning to end, i felt like it was like playing a really boring game.  I like final fantasy 8 and 10 better."
5,Awesome,"this Game is awesome a must have for the vita!!!! best racing game so far and the grapics are stunning, not perfect but defenitely very good! it seems that finally EA did work on this title.... there some minor problems though 1- the lights from the uncoming traffic seems pixalated but nothing that is that bad it doent alter your gaming experience at all and 2- there are some glitches but it seems they fixed them because there is an UPDATE already... other  than that awesome game."
5,I love it!,"Oh this controller is heaven, It looks beautiful and I wasn't expecting the vibration, I absolutely recommend it."
1,no local co-op,"No local co-op for both campaign and matchmaking. This was a killer for me, so I ended up returning the game. Halo has always been a social game for me, and I guess 343 doesn't want to maintain that aspect of the Halo series anymore."
1,YUCK!,"I was really looking forward to buying this game since I love the PC version of Virtual Villagers, however, this version is totally different and really terrible.  The characters struggle when you pick them up (which you HAVE to do in order for the game to proceed) and the graphics are very amateurish.  I really wish I hadn't wasted my money on it.  A big disappointment."
1,Total waste of money. Poor internet servers,This game is an absolute disappointment and disgrace to the call of duty franchise. I would recommend buying Titanfall2 if you like futuristic fast paced shooters and if you're only interested in Modern Warfare remastered save your money and wait till its released as a standalone game.
1,Not worth the money,"It is a wisk brush and a flat rubber tip with a piece of felt glued to it, you are better off using lens cleaner and lens wipes"
5,Attractive light to midrange protection,"Exactly as advertised,  color is very vivid, zipper works well and feels sturdy enough to put in a bag or carry around. Console fits snuggly inside. This would not withstand heavy weight however, dont sit on it or let others :). Not sure it would protect from a high drop either so keep in mind depending on level of protection you need. Has slots for 10 games and zipper pouch large enough for a lot of accessories."
1,it's not what you buy,the ps4 has optical audio the slim does not have it. I buy a 1tbt ps4 with optical audio it is not
5,Perfection,I adore every second of this game. Iga has delivered on his promise and his talent and years in the industry show.  If you love any of the Castlevania games this game is a absolute purchase.
5,Great Game,Great game looks awesome on the PS5
5,AMAZING GAME!!!,"I pre-ordered this and it arrived just a little while ago. I have maybe an hour into game play just to get myself familiar with the battle system and although I found it a bit over whelming at first, I'm getting used to it. I'm a long time Final Fantasy fan and it's pretty much my all time favorite RPG so I was really excited about this game before release date. The graphics are just stunning and the little bit of story line that I got in just the 1 hour of playing, I can see that it's going to be amazing. I've seen the movie: Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV to get the back story and I think that will make the experience of playing this game more enjoyable. I also got the standard edition players guide by Piggyback, I'm not one to rush through a game just to continue on with the story, I like taking my sweet time and getting everything possible. Lol. Square Enix certainly went above and beyond with this game and I think Final Fantasy fans would enjoy it. Happy gaming everyone. :)"
5,It just works!,"Honestly, I can't understand why Nintendo didn't include a charging dock like this in the design of the Switch in the first place! I LOVE this charging dock. Install took seconds, and I love that it attaches directly to the Switch dock. My 4 young kids find it easy to use and I like that at a glance I can see who didn't put their charger away. Takes up very little real estate and no cords to get tangled, ripped out of the console, bent at the charging tip, or any of the other expensive gaming system mishaps I've encountered over the years. Everyone with more than 1 JoyCon should have this!"
4,Hidden object mysteries and more,"I've enjoyed all the Jewel Quest series, and this one is better than most. It has the familiar hidden-mystery screens (always with the ONE item that's hidden in plain sight) and some change-ups from the match-3 jewel boards. I didn't much enjoy the scrolling object-find screens, mostly because the objects were often hidden behind foreground features and were gone before I could click on them. But that may just be my age showing - I'm not as quick on the click as I used to be!"
2,"If you are buying for the color, you will probably be disappointed.","This controller is purple in name alone. I ordered this controller because purple is one of my favorite colors. I was disappointed to see that they chose a color that is so dark that is almost indistinguishable from the black controller. The controller is still great from a quality and performance standpoint, but the color shown in the images is misleading."
1,Not what the picture on the box shows,"I had the same experience as others. The picture showed 2 sets, a set of paddles and a set of joysticks, not the 2 joysticks that I received."
5,Husband love it,Good price
1,Disappointing,The PlayStation plus requirement should be optional not required.  This game is similar to Fallout 4(which I enjoyed).  This turned out to a copy paste money grab.  Very disappointing
1,What a disappointment!!!,I received this game for Christmas--what a waste of money!  I am attempting to run it on Windows 7.  Almost nothing works as it should.  Setting preferences regarding sound etc. seems to be futile as the settings do not hold the next time the program opens.  I have yet to figure out how you can simply stop a game.  No exit is visable.  For about 15 minutes the games could be operated full screen.  After that I was stuck with a small window and a large black surround.  I am throwing this out.  Don't buy this sorry software!
5,Great way to connect the switch to tv without dock,"I travel a lot with my Nintendo switch and I was looking for a way not to lug around the dock.  This device works for exactly that.  You will need usbc charger, this device, and an HDMI cable.  Connect this device to your switch via the USB port, connect the HDMI to this device and the TV, then connect the usbc power source to the port on the device and it will work automatically.  There is a slight delay and you might need to press the power button a few times to turn the screen on the switch on and off, but it's a really quick process and works as described.  I would recommend this product for anyone that wants to play their switch on the TV without the dock."
5,Great compilation of games!,"I think this is one of the best compilation of ""Brain games"" out there for the Nintendo DS. I had briefly played Brain age-II on my friend's DS and I think this game has more variety than Brain age. I was impressed with the graphics and the variety of games in this collection (especially in the logic section). Whether you are thinking about your first game in this genre or thinking about expanding to your brain games library, this is a great pick."
5,A truly unforgettable experience.,"I bought this game because I needed a new game for my DS. And before this, I wasn't a fan of anime, but you can't help yourself but to fall in love with the CITH's plot and characters. I wouldn't hesitate to call it one of the best games on the DS, if not, any Nintendo system. It's sad that there hasn't been an HD remaster confirmed, but I don't doubt it will."
1,Waited 2 years for nothing.,I held off re-playing Fallout 4 because I wanted to own all the dlc for my next game. I waited for the GOTY edition so that I could have this. And now I find that owning the GOTY edition is no different than if I had gone ahead and purchased access to servers that contained the dlc two years ago. I waited all this time for nothing. And so now I guess I am done with the game. Well-played Bethesda.
5,6 year old,"My husband wanted to buy this for our Grandson's birthday. Well, he absolutely loves it! They have not had 1 problem with it. Right now his big thing is BOWLING! Actually bowling and then playing the game when he's at home."
1,Download Version Non-Refundable,"I purchased this after my disc stopped working. It downloaded fine, but installation through Origin doesn't work. Help is just a list of trouble-shooting bullet points. I went through EA.com to try to register the product codes there and realized that they are all bogus (4 characters too long for what is required). Origin also requires only 16 characters and the ones I received are 20. When I asked for a refund, I got an email back saying ""sorry but it's against the terms you agreed to."" No one reads those things, so my loss, but I thought I would warn others about the fake product codes."
5,Addicting Game,"I am a big fan of the Lego games and this one does not disappoint.  The moves are great and this game really brings them to life in the Lego world.  It has all the silliness of a Lego game and even has the real actor's voices doing the lines from the movie.  Having it for the Wii U was definitely a wise decision as I like there is no split screen due to the Wii U gamepad.  My 10 year old loves it just as much as I do and this is a game we both can play without the worry of content she should not be watching.  That is what I love most about the Lego games.  They are very family friendly and very easy for all ages.  It has all the iconic scenes from the movie and many of the characters have specific attributes they use to help you along on your quest.  I had debated on whether to get it for Xbox 360 or Wii U and I am happy with my decision to get it for the Wii U, especially with some of the problems I have been reading about for the 360.  I can't wait to unlock more stuff and get the dinosaurs I have already unlocked.  This game is epic and well worth the money."
1,"Love Civ. IV, hate Civ. V","Aside from the whole Steam issue, this game just isn't fun. When I got Civ. IV it was immediately addicting and I stayed up half the night playing it. Civ. 5 is just boring. You can't micromanage your cities. The graphics are worse than Civ. IV's. All of the useful numerical information that you need to make decisions is now hidden or nonexistent. The game runs slow, even with a computer that meets or exceeds all the requirements. It's buggy. The whole thing feels dumbed down. I never write reviews, but felt like I had to for this because it's just so bad. I'm going back to Civ. IV. Very disappointing."
2,Maybe buy them or maybe don't.,Great headphones with really good sound quality but after a month of simply just using them the plastic part at the top of the headphones broke and has rendered the headset completely useless. I'd say buy them for the good sound quality but would go against it as you'll never know if just setting them down will break the.
1,"This is a digital copy, not the real deal",My son was very disappointed to open this and find a cardboard disc with an online code. The seller does not state clearly that this is a digital copy. Very very disappointing.
1,Be careful check your computer first.,Would not install. Waste of money. Tryed different ways of installing but nothing will work. Check your PC to make sure it will run the game be for buying it.
4,I can honestly say the base game in VI is way better than the either of those games at launch without ...,"I've played Civ IV with its expansions for a long time and Civ V with all of its expansions the last few years.  I can honestly say the base game in VI is way better than the either of those games at launch without their expansions.  I haven't noticed any bugs.  AI is AI.  At least it isn't a surprise why they act the way they do in this version of Civ.  Although the AI can appear to have a split personality due to the dual agendas.  Also, they don't seem to easily forgive transgressions.  I'm not sure I like how religion plays in the game.  Convert a major religion center and you effectively wipe that religion out of the game as they will instead produce religious units of the current religion in the city and it appears no way to get the original religion back unless you had an apostle stashed somewhere (and the AI doesn't appear to be that forward thinking).  My biggest complaint is that the Civilopedia appears to have so much less useful information and the UI doesn't seem to give you all the information you need on the breakdown of tourism, amenities, etc.  Seems it is trying to keep a lot of things hidden behind the scenes.  Maybe that is trying to simplify the game or not overburden players with information, but I find it just leaves me playing while making ill informed decisions.  I really hate the fact that it doesn't show the numbers of religious followers in a foreign city all the time if no religion is dominant in the city.  But that may be a bug.  Either way, I imagine there will be some improvement with patches and some polishing with expansions, but as a base game, I've really enjoyed it and I like the twists with the city unstacking and the new options for declaring war."
1,For Shame Bethesda.,Add my voice to the growing chorus of unhappy purchasers of this package. The DLC and 1.17 patch equal about 15gb. There's no reason these couldn't have been included on the disc. Shame on you Bethesda.
2,Misleading product picture,"This item works well as a remote controller. However, it does not include the silicone skin and strap showing in the second product description image. If you do not include them, why the hell you show them in the picture? Are you providing a true description of this item?"
1,Please don't bend it.,Came in with a big crease and I keep my amiibos in the packaging so I want a replacement without no damage to it at all.
1,The data cable stopped working in less than 2 weeks.,"After using it for less than 2 weeks, my computer could no longer recognize the device, giving usb unrecognized error."
5,Well Designed Headset,"Headset has great sound and microphone quality, which is great for gaming; the noise cancellation is on bar.  I specially like the design and the LED light, which matches very well with my Laptop and Gaming PC."
1,One Star,The plug doesn't even fit in the xbox....
2,Meh...,"This is more of an animated movie than a game. The game play is said to be very fluid and intuitive, but these seem more like code words for haphazard and restricted to quick time event type button pushing. There is a lot more watching the game than playing it. I was very disappointed. I love games that are cinematic, but I want to actually be able to play them, otherwise I'd just rent a movie."
5,Takes Trains Games To An Entirely New Level,"After getting frustrated with the keyboard controls of the new Rail Simulator I broke down and bought this controller.  It makes all the difference in the world in enjoying the game.  Even better, it come pre-programmed for Train Simulator, Trainz, and Rail Simulator (although you will need to download the update for Rail Simulator).  I've been enjoying it so much I've actually gone back an re-purchased MS Train Simulator just to replay some favorite routes with the controller.  I play all types of games but I've never been this excited about a controller - it creates an incredibly rich experience that's just impossible with a keyboard."
5,Cute - Compact - Holds 10 and is portable.,"I bought two of these, and can say these are way cuter in person. They hold 10 which is more than enough, are easy to remove and are held together with a small magnet instead of an infuriating clasp. Not pictured is a little area for a wrist strap, two little holes on the corner, a nice plus. Also the shipping was unbelievably fast got it the next day."
5,NFS,"Very fun game, loved the cars and running from the cops! Glad I bought the game, I encourage everyone to get it. Need for Speed makes the best racing games!"
1,Not a Microsoft FS program.,"Unable to fully install program, kept getting error messages. Using Win10-64 bit, plenty of computing power (Core7 8th gen, 16 gigs of ram, video card with 4 gigs ultra fast memory).Definately NOT Microsoft Flight Simulator."
5,Doing justice to a game long overdue for a release,"I played this on a ROM some time ago when DeJap released their translation patch. I loved it, just thought it needed some polishing. And, honestly, I couldn't be more impressed. I thought the systems in the second Star Ocean were some of the best I've ever seen in an RPG, despite the learning curve, and this game is basically Star Ocean done in the style of the Second Story. I couldn't be happier. The game is beautiful, the environments look fantastic. I always thought the original was a little cramped, and now the areas are much, much larger.  The storyline isn't the most original, by any means, but it's pretty good for standard RPG fare, and the characters and events have a nostalgic charm that really reminds the player of the classic 16 bit RPGs of yore. The item creation and skill systems, as well as Private Actions, have been updated to the depth of the second game and really add that little something that set The Second Story apart from its contemporaries. All I have left to say is I can't wait for the release of Second Evolution."
2,Spongebob:  There are better Wii titles.,"Fortunately, we rented this one before we bought it.  The concept behind the game is fine.  Plenty of non-violent puzzle solving activities, but it did not peg our fun meter.  The Wii interface developed for this game is pretty flawed.  For instance, there is a critical task where you have to activate a wench by twirling the Wii-mote in the air.  Spongebob is told to crank hard and fast, which his animated character does.  However, it only works if the player twirls it very slowly.  Driving games feel pretty awkward too.  Animation and graphics are only so-so. As a whole, the game lacks polish. I think most adults would be bored by the game and it won't maintain the attention of a younger audience for long, it certainly did not capture the interest of my kids who are fans of the cartoon.  I considered giving this three-stars, but for the price, I think we should expect more from the game developers."
5,Does the job,Does exactly what I want it to. You can keep the back light on all the time or to conserve power you can press the SPACE and SHIFT key to turn the light off. Feels comfortable and is a snug fit on my controller. Highly recommend it for games like Ffxiv.
1,Don't like one of the games? Too bad.,"Only five of the games are available right away. You have to play all of, EVEN THE ONES YOU HATE to get enough stars to unlock the next island... Wish I didn't buy this one. Stinks. I like s couple of the mini games."
5,Satisfied,Love the way you get the codes in your email its quick.
1,too many bugs,I had to return this game.. I kept getting an error failed login.. No issues with other games.
1,Did not include Sparrow Gjallawing promo,dont purchase!! it doesnt include the Sparrow Gjallawing promo code. Only received the Gjallahorn code but not the sparrow.
1,Fell Short of Just Dance,"So I am a HUGE fan of the just dance games! In fact, I own the Just Dance 2, Just Dance 3, and Just Dance 4. I love how those games combine new and old songs.I decided to try this, even though some of the songs all a little inappropriate for younger kids. From the videos ads this game looked very challenging. I was really exited. Don't be fooled. This game so was easy it was a joke! Sure the songs had beats that made you want to dance, but the dances were horribly sloth-like. Other reviews said stuff like ""how am I supposed to know what moves to do next just by the little man in the corner!?"" haha please, don't make me laugh. for one thing, all the songs repeat moves, so after a bit , you catch on. after just playing it twice, you get the hang of it. why do people expect it to be so easy on the first try!? Anyway it was a let-down because of how easy it was. Granted, I do get perfect scores on all my other just dance games so i might be a little biased. but most people who are into dancing like a bit of a challenge."
5,Great!,Made a great gift! Looked awesome and he was stoked! Very pleased as it was very affordable!
5,Excelente mi hijo lo va disfrutar muchísimo,Es el regalo de cumpleaños de mi hijo y le va encantar muchísimo muchas gracias
5,Came in great condition!,"I'm proud to say that this is a really excellent figure!! Nothing came in broken at all and the box itself was in amazing condition as well! Miku stands really well on her intended base stand, and the paint on her isn't chipped at all. I'm hopefully looking to order more from Taito in the future!! You guys have very wonderful figures and i'm really happy with my purchase."
4,Give it a chance..the fun ramps up as you play,"Initially I was not really feeling this game at all, the graphics are nice for the Wii and the Wii specific control seems too simple at first, but after some time put in I ilke this NFS best of all.  Terrific and fun car controls are all you need to put this into the realm of an adrenaline rush classic like F-Zero GX.  The controls also probably make this the most accesible NFS title yet once you practice them for a small amount and upgrade your cars HANDLING ability, the interface using the Nunchuck is a little convuluted and confusing, as are the menus but then it wouldn't be an EA game without them would it. Overall worth it if you wanna go FAST on your Wii- think excite truck with more realism and SPEED"
5,Great Fun For Everyone!,"I bought this game for my kids for Christmas, and EVERYONE young and old played!  Worth every penny!  I am buying an extra mat so that more than one person can play at a time!"
5,"Beautiful Game.  Prime example of what story, immersion, fascination, that should be in a game.",This is one of the greatest games I've ever played.  Beautiful artwork and animation. Unbelievably gorgeous music.  Intriguing puzzles and a dynamic that allows the player to be motivated to keep exploring and become part of the adventurous legend and story.  Five Stars ...it deserves nothing less.
1,Tried to return on day 31 and was told no returns!!!,I would never buy from this person again! I bought this for my Disney infinity 3.0 game but it will freeze during use! Causing me to reset the game to try and continue! This is the only piece that does this on my system! Something is wrong with this product! Don't buy!!! I'd be more understanding if I was trying to return it after 3 months or more but I'm trying to fill the return information on day 31!!!! Nuts
5,Love my new controller!,"I bought this controller specifically for my Samsung Tab S7 5G to play Fortnite mobile. This controller does everything it's supposed to. Extremely easy setup and pairing with my tablet. Wired mode is cool when using the phone clip, which I've tested out on my Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra. ALL buttons worked perfectly with Fortnite. Programing the back buttons was a breeze. I own the Xbox One controller and this one is more lightweight. I like it better because it doesn't hurt my inner palms like the heavier XB1 controller does. I added my Kontrol Freeks and precision rings and fit perfectly just as it does for XB1. Though the XB1 controller is awesome I bought the Moga for the back buttons and for Fortnite mobile compatibility. So I've made the switch over. Very happy!!"
1,This Game SUCKS!!,This has to be the most horrible game I've ever played.  I purchased this game for 19 bucks (THANK GOODNESS I didn't drop the original sale price of this turd) from Game Stop with high expectations.  I am a huge fan of the ACE Combat games so I was kind of skeptical about purchasing outside of the Ace games.  First off the graphics suck for a PS3. I think that they look just like the PSP graphics.  The way the plays wobble from side to side while in flight is rediculous and cartoonish.  The missions are dumb too.  Fly around shoot some SAM sight with some cheesey sounding missiles and horrible tracer rounds. If you are thinking of buying this crap DON'T DO IT! Im being serious! The only reason that I'm even writing this is to keep people from waisting their hard earned cash on this turd of a game. Im going back to game stop and trading it in for somthing more worth my money. HORRIBLE PEICE OF POOP GAME!!!!  At least the cover looks cool.
1,terrible,"Terrible,  can't stand EA after this,  no more franchise mode are you kidding me.  Not sure what they were thinking"
2,Done with COD,"Worst COD yet.  Unrealistic and severely uneven weapons damage, players still allowed to hop like bunny rabbits, terrible spawn point algorithm and now a terrible in game pay for challenge system.  I don't think I will by another COD ever again."
1,50 stars? oh please!,"this game is summed up in one word, overhyped, dont go by all the 5 star reviews here, this game is not all that."
1,"I'm sorry, it looks horrible for the wii.",Awaiting this game and I was let down. It looks way better on the xbox 360. the music is fine but its better if you just rent the game first before you decide to purchase it. Not sure why they decided to put horrible looking holograms of themselves on this game for the wii. I didn't like it and would rather sell it and get it for the xbox 360. Hope this helped you out.
5,Great rechargable wireless mouse,Great gaming mouse with rechargable wireless connection - that's why I bought it. Adjustable speed is a great feature and the look is also very cool.
5,A very beautiful game.,"I have nothing but incredibly wonderful things to say about this magical,  beautiful game.  if you are the type of gamer that loves mind twisting puzzles and an incredible storyline than this game is for you. This game will test your cleverness and touch your heart."
5,Elite series 2,Works on a series elite 2.
4,Play it on easy for your sake,"As a fan of the digimon world series since the 1st playstation game I was really excited to see some of the old gameplay features would come back. The game isn't like your traditional turn based rpg, like the recently released cyber sleuth. It feels more like a pet sim like the original playstation game. Unlike the original you are in charge of two digimon this time around. Each digimon has a personality and likes and dislikes, there are in game days and you have to figure out how you spend them. Training your digimon doesn't consist of grinding battles, but taking them into the gym and choosing a stat to raise. The magic of the game is digivolving your digimons, there are multiple digivolution for each digimon to achieve. The challenge is that the required stats for digivolution are hidden. In order to unlock them you have to interact with your digimon when prompted to by the game like after battles or training. This is a the best and worst part of the game, the fact that the stats revealed from the digivolution chart after these interaction are random makes it super tedious on top of the interactions themselves occurring at random intervals after battles and training. It can take a few in game days for the full requirement of a digivolution. This is also another thing that can make the game frustrating seeing as each digimon has a life expectancy of a few days that only increases when you digivolve it. I highly recommend you play the game on easy as it would not change the battle difficulty but the digivolution requirements. Over all the game is great if you're a fan of the series specially an old fan but be warned it can be very frustrating"
1,I am speechless!,"I made the mistake of playing the wii version first and that was so so much fun.  So when this game came out I went and purchased a brand new Xbox 360 along with the Kinect to play this game.  Needless to say, I have kept the Xbox and the Kinect, but this game went right back to the store. The whole time I was playing the game I was waiting for the ""Michael Jackson Experience"" unfortunately I never got it.  The Que cards are to low on the screen and the games doesn't recognize some of your movements. Thriller is boring, Smooth Criminal was just upsetting, BAD was just plain bad and Beat It was the icing on the cake.  If you have a phobia about looking fat, then this is not the game for you.  If you have played the wii version, keep the memory alive and don't buy this game.  If you are expecting to see cool looking dancers in the back ground and not a feminine looking guy doing aerobic exercises and you standing in the middle going what the ""Heck"" then this is definitely not the game for you!! My BAD for not reading the reviews before purchasing the game...sorry MJ"
4,I have thoroughly enjoyed playing these games on the Xbox One console,"I have thoroughly enjoyed playing these games on the Xbox One console. The three installments run slightly better than they did on the older consoles and, though the visuals aren't on par with current gen A.C. games (obviously), this is the best these three games have ever looked. Textures have been improved, colors and lighting have seen slight improvements, resolution is now 1080p, and frame rate issues are generally improved. Overall, this is a good, if not excellent, collection of modestly remastered games. Tangentially, I would very much like to see Ubisoft remaster Assassin's Creed III, as i think it would really shine on the current gen consoles."
5,Bottom Line,"Scalpers are cancer. Capitalist apologists are cancer. Randian society is cancer. The product is fantastic. Don't buy above the MSRP, I don't care if you're a super collector. The longer the scalpers have to hold onto it the lower the prices will go. If Nintendo was done distributing these, it wouldn't still be on their website. I'm getting a new 3ds regardless what it ends up being, I doubt I'll get this, unfortunately, but I could be wrong. Stay strong."
5,I'm exhausted from playing with this all day!,I've had it for a day now and I can honestly say I love it. I'm actually a bit exhausted from wanting to try out so many demos. The core kit only comes with the demo disc which actually works out pretty well as it gives you a good idea of which games are more to your liking.
5,"Oerfect for CEMU, gyro works on CEMU too","For those emulating on PC using CEMU, this works great. Install BetterJoyForCemu (follow instructions) and connect controller to PC using bluetooth to make it work on CEMU. Gyro works on CEMU as well, didnt expect that at all. Dont forget to edit settings file of BetterJoyForCemu to allow third party controller, or else joysticks may not work as expected. Happy emulating WiiU."
5,POUND FOR POUND THE BEST PORTABLE EVER!,"POUND FOR POUND THE BEST PORTABLE EVER!Nintendo doesn't come close. And its silky smooth silver. pretty. This is the kind of machine that all us guys playing Electronic Quarterback back in the early 80's dreamed about. Even with the relatively small screen the graphics are excellent. I found the battery life to be very long for any game I am playing or at least until I get to a place to recharge. This PSP is not just for the kids. I bought the console for my daughter and while she was showing me the WIFI,I noticed it was a full entertainment system with a built in mic and Skype!! So I did what any sensible dad would do...I bought one for myself! This is a very well designed machine, if you have checked the past PSP history they have a very long life. Perfect for both adults and young ones. Worth every penny."
1,bad deal,"steam deck is 400.00 retail, the 1 TB of memory is about 150.00. So you are paying 400 extra for someone to take off 3 or 4 screws and swap out the memory card? that's too much. I could buy a ps5 almost for that much."
1,I'm so so so so tired of poorly made headsets,"I've been through so many headsets in the past two years, I am at the point where I want to make my own company so I can get a product that doesn't break in less than a year.  The piece of the headset that allows the ear peace to move is much too stiff at the joint where it meets the headband, and as such it put way too much force on the joint where the rotator meets the ear peace, and the earpiece snapped off. The simple motion of taking the headset off my head is what caused the device to break. PATHETIC, truly terrible. Honestly though, even though I was trying steel series for the first time I expected this to happen because that's the world we live in. Charge someone almost two hundred dollars for something that doesn't even last a year. So i bought the 4 year protection plan, except I'm realizing the item was 170, the policy maxes out at 175 AND THEY WANT ME TO INCLUDE TAX, so there's a chance it wont even be covered, at which point I'll probably  go on a murderous rampage at steelseries hq over how f'ed this is."
2,Not all that impressed:(,"I was so excited to get this game, but it fell short of my expectations.  It does not work on the skills of a beginning reader.  I was hoping it would work on sight words and helping my child sound out words, but it has an expectation that you already know how to read.  It has very few games and once they complete them, they are done.  My son has almost conquered the entire game and he just got the game yesterday.  I would not recommend this to anyone.  I feel like I wasted my money."
4,Good product for the cost,"It does what it is supposed to very well and less expensive than the other ones.  It comes with like 2000 nuts, bolts, screws, and washers, but you only need a few of them, the rest are for other applications that are not shown in the manual. I did nearly bleed out after bumping my knee on the sharp edges, a little bit of black duct tape took care of that issue but it would be nice if they included 4 plastic or rubber pieces to put on the ends.  The brackets where the clamp is appear to have bent slightly after installing, will have to keep an eye on that in case they need to be reinforced or replaced with some angle iron.  The vertical pieces are very long to accomondate taller desks, I ended up cutting off a few inches with a chop saw to keep them out of the way."
2,Xbox 360 case,"The side walls of this case are week so it will collapse on you if you are not careful. Not enough room in the front pocket and you can't carry everything you will need in this bag you will only get the machine,powercord and maybe hdmi cable to fit. Nice idea but disapointing."
2,An atrocity to my beloved franchise.,"I have been a huge Halo fan boy ever since I saw screens running on Apple Hard ware in the late 90s. When Halo moved on to the XBOX it was the very thing that prompted to me to go out and purchase said console. The game for me was revolutionary, and gave me years of system link fun. Halo 2 however, is a horrid piece of trash. This does not come from someone who hates Xbox, or the Halo series, but from a fateful fan who feels disinfranchised. First off none of the touted story line of an epic battle on earth even appears in the game, with the exception of a haphazardly thrown together joke of a level in the beginning. Secondly the graphics though noticeable better, glitch in and out distracting, and detracting during the horribly scripted cinema sequences. The story line is pure and utter pedestrine bs, that could have come better prepared by a couple of three year old's let loose with felt tip markers and giant poster boards. The campaign mode is boring, and the highly touted AI is downgraded to such a point now, that is possible to jump past entire levels of enemies without once firing your weapon. Not too mention, now  your teams AI is downgraded, their ability or I should say inability to maneauveur vehicles ruins all aspects of using your troops tacticly. While Halo ones levels could be monotonos they did have an epic feel and provoked exploration, this game however is so linear, that it drives you to just run and gun ignoring the small but at time intriquing environments. Now, some are going to hate me for my next comment, but it must be said, the new weapons are a disaster. While I entriely enjoy the new covenant weapons, as well as a few tweeks to the existing ones, the human weapons have either been removed or downgraded. The new assault rifle is not only underpowered, but the lack of ammunition throughout the campaign (and multiplayer for that matter) voids it entirely useless. The downgraded magnum is left in the game but without a scope and is so powerless now that it is nothing more than a slap in the face for those who were skilled enough to own with it in the first game. Finally the rocket launcher has now become a weapon of little to no skill. One of the things I once prided myself during multiplayer Halo one was my ability to gauge where the enemy would be and kill them half way across the map with it. Gone is this skill, and replaced is the overpowerful, and at times absurd lock on rocket. Because of all these changes the only thing that remains remotely fun about the game is multiplayer ctf with vehicles, as myself as well as friends rarely bother with the crappy aresenal. I urge all who were excited about this game and have not yet been duped into buying it to at least rent it, especially if you do not have XBOX live which appears to be its only real saving grace."
2,"Seems like a good buy, not so much.",The first one didn't work after a few days.  Customer service was nice and sent a replacement but now it is broken again.  So we have gone through two of these in less than 6 months. They are expensive but do not seem to be made very well.  Be cautious when buying.
5,Five Stars,i might get this but i dont know i am getting my brother a present for his birthday so
1,for the love of god dont buy!,"Dont buy, doesnt fit. scratched my ps vita pretty bad after trying to get this thing on. Threw this piece of crap in the trash literally 5 minutes after opening package."
1,Item does not match the picture and will not assemble correctly,"Waited a month for this.  Was so excited when it arrived.  The pictures on the item page on Amazon show a long flexible strand coming out the sides of the headset where you attach the pieces too.  Mine only has a short, flimsy plastic piece.  The attachments do not fit and slide off.  There is nothing to adjust to keep it secure like in the videos or pictures.  I don't' know if this  is how they're making it now because I see others complaining about the same thing or I received the wrong one, but this does not work, is not as described or pictured and you cannot use it."
1,Memory card slot broken on arrival.,Won't accept memory card also damaged the memory card in the process.
1,Doesn't charge,"Placing controllers in chargers only could get it to charge once. Very finicky, loose connection. Pay more for the oem. I am sending back was not worth the money or the wait."
4,Updated,While I had issues with the first one I recieved. The company took my first review and contacted me to figure out the issues and tried very hard to correct it asking several questions and sending the reports to their designers. This newer version is a lot better and works well as a full charging station for the Oculus Quest 2. The only issue I have with it is the headset needs to be attached to a cord unlike the magnetic one that Anker sells. The cord does help if using an elite battery pack though so that is a plue for that. I would now recommend this brand and the company to others.
5,overpriced? yeah but expected,"Honestly this is in line if not better priced than how they have priced their hard drives in the past. Do I wish they would support external drives, sure but they could have made this much worse pricewise so no big eal to me."
5,Nostalgia Overload!,"I had this on Gamecube and still love it. I'm able to play with my siblings, just like old times. I highly recommend it, especially during these times."
5,Great deal! Massive Storage and 2 great games,Great deal ! Massive Storage and 2 great games. Upgraded from my 6 year old Elite model and its much more responsive and quieter
1,Not worth the money!,Very displeased. Made my ps4 even hotter. Would like to return it but I don't see an option for that
5,Very Happy,"I have purchased numerous gamepads in the past, and have eventually returned or sold them, as I could never get the buttons programmed to all the key features I needed.  With this pad, I am pleased.  The buttons can be programmed to any keystrike you like, and there is even a shift button, just under the base of the thumb, which essentially doubles all the buttons.  It does take a little while to get the hang of the program software, but once learned, it is seamless.  I have played Half-Life 2:episode one and Darwinia, freed of the key board.  Each game has a different profile which is easily loaded prior to starting the games.  Of note, this keypad only works with the left hand, leaving the right to drive the mouse.  Not a problem for me, but I know some people shop at the Leftorium, and this may not accomodate them.  Also, tho it looks like the distance from the handrest to the keys may be adjusted, they are actually fixed.  The thumb dongle, however, may be tilted and slid in an out.  The silver knob on the side tightens and loosens the bar which lets it slide."
5,Amazing graphics,"I was swept away by the graphics on this. Almost like watching a movie. If you like this sort, this is the best I've ever seen."
5,Know Your Role and buy this game,"I admit, I hated wrestling games at first. They were frustrating because I had to press too many buttons to pull off one simple move, even more for the finisher if I ever got that far. Then along came WWF Smackdown for Playstation, which pretty much took out the difficulty factor concerning controls, making the game much more enjoyable for me, especially when I held four belts with Kane in Season mode. Hearing nothing but good things for Smackdown 2, I just had to buy it and did so. When I popped it into my Playstation, I noticed that the loading times were a lot longer than they were in the first Smackdown. Even though that aspect of the game isn't really easy to overlook, the rest of the game made up for it. When I played the first Smackdown, there were a plethora of matches, and I couldn't think that there were more types. I was wrong. SM2 still has all the types of matches that SM had and then some. Hell in a Cell, IronMan matches (regular and special guest referee), Casket, Table, Ladder, and TLC (regular or title) are among the many types of matches in this game (personally I like Hell in a Cell and the IronMan matches). The season mode is refined and better than in SM. Instead of one match per month, there are five, and you earn some extra things during the season, from parts in Create A Superstar to characters (Stone Cold and Billy Gunn have to be unlocked). The mats even have the Pay-Per-View special logos from No Mercy '99 to Unforgiven 2000 (you can customize the mats in exhibition mode). You can still skip matches including your own, but it takes longer than it did in SM. The storylines are a little better, though still repetitive, but you can interact in some situations, like asking or telling someone to do something. I haven't actually created someone yet but Create A Superstar is much better than it was in SM. There are a lot more options concerning appearance and moves. You can also create things like managers, taunts, teams (known as stables) and PPV specials. The graphics are excellent and add a sense of realism, especially with all 50 or so characters, from the different backstage areas to Undertaker's bike in his entrance. There are many more backstage areas, like a diner, plaza, lobby, locker room, etc. SM2 has an expanded and updated roster of superstars, including the Radicalz, Too Cool and Rikishi, Kurt Angle, Stephanie McMahon, The Kat, and even my man Shawn Michaels. I'd write more but I've written a lot already and it's 2:30 in the morning. All I have to say is Know Your Role and buy this game. By the way, to get out of the Hell in a Cell, bounce off the ropes in the middle of the ring and dive into the panels that are colored lighter than the rest of the cell."
5,5 stars but still returned -Mic communication limitation on Switch,"This product does what it is CAPABLE of doing.  I say that because while the switch is docked the audio worked well with my beats headset.  The MICROPHONE on my headset will not work.  This is not the fault of the Gulikit.  It is the limitation of the Nintendo Switch which makes my blood boil.  Basically there is no way currently that an individual wireless headset with a microphone will work while the switch is docked if you are trying to be able to talk into the microphone on the wireless headset you are using.  So bottom line is if you want to talk on games like Overwatch through you beats headset or apple airpods while the switch is docked you will be disappointed.  The blame is all on Nintendo.  Sadly, Im finding more and more that I should have just purchased an xbox or play station."
1,"Love the Vita, HATE Sony","i love my vita but i freaking hate sony for forcing us to use their proprietary memory card.they are definitely trying to nickel and dime us here. i wish it would just accept standards micro sd. also, the vita is nearly useless without a memory card. once again, i hate you sony!"
5,Complete bundle received.,"I was nervous buying this because this wildcat bundle is VERY popular at this time. It's not even about about switch, everyone just wants the skin. This set can no longer be purchased in stores. Alot of recent reviews were stating the wildcat bundle card was missing from the package. I purchased this brand new with Amazon prime and fortunately everything was in the box as stated in the description. This is the real deal. Just make sure you are buying new and it's fulfilled by Amazon and it should be fine.  I noticed there were alot of different sellers. Fulton Tech was the seller for my order and it was fulfilled by Amazon if that makes any difference."
5,It sure worked!,Perfect amount for my PS2 to actually run.
1,Physical copy came without product key. Required 2 hours ...,Physical copy came without product key. Required 2 hours in chat before I was told I'd have to wait another 24 hours before I even find out whether or not I'll get a key at all.
1,Same junk as always,Same game for years. Different colored menu though
1,NBA 2K19 is horrible,Do not buy this game if you actually like basketball.  I would rather play Double Dribble.  This gets one star because I can't give it zero stars.
5,Good product,Works very well with 4K UHD TV
5,Stop Writing Reviews before the game is out,"Oppinions are great but this is a REVIEW section, not an oppinion of what game will be like section."
1,Avoid this garbage,"There is no question about it.  This is the worst casino video game on the market.  The reason stems from the change in ownership of the Hoyle Franchise from Sierra to Encore.  Anyone who has ever bought an Encore Software casino game can testify to the fact that they are ALWAYS riddled with mathematical errors and unplayable bugs.  This version is no different than anything Encore produced in the past.  It is my understanding that Sierra began development of this game but Encore finished it.  I bought it in the hopes that Sierra had put enough of their programming expertise into the game, but unfortunately, the game is trash.  There are terrible unplayable bugs throughout the game and the game plays out in such poor quality. I tried to remedy the problem with the downloadable patch, but when that didn't work properly I uninstalled the game and threw it in the trash!  Avoid this game and avoid all Encore casino products. Buy the versions of Hoyle under the name ""Sierra""."
1,Save your money!,"There are 3 major problems with this game.  First, when you start a new puzzle, all of the pieces start in the area where you are supposed to assemble the puzzle.  It takes too long to move the pieces so that you have an open area.  Second, once you move the pieces, there is very little room on the outside of the assembly area to let you sort the pieces.  Third, almost all of the pictures are of trees and water, with a floral picture thrown in here and there.  Very little variety as far as the pictures.  So...save your money!"
5,Marvelous,"You put together some original ideas and combine it with dark soul concepts and you get games like bloodborne and nioh. Oh ya, this game is fantastic."
1,Don't get it.,"I haven't bought this game or even have a computer to run it, but I am mad that they don't have a LAN option and only have one campaign. The first game had 3 campaigns!  What I did see from videos on YouTube is that the game play looks solid and the graphics are very nice. I don't like that I would need an internet connection to play the game.If I ever buy a computer I won't be getting this game for sure."
5,Five Stars,I'm in the future.
5,Five Stars,A Cory in every house! A Cory on every table!
5,best console for BF4!,"Sony PS4 is the best console for Battlefield 4. Not only are the graphics better than xbox's but the controller is so good, that I prefer to use PS4 to play Battlefield 4 on it instead of my PC."
1,Faulty system,I have 810 credit score but I was denied for not having enough credit history......yeahhhhhhhhh
1,Hard to setup,Not exactly what we thought it would be. Can definitely tell it's not American made quality. Directions are vague and don't really answer any questions. Had to watch YouTube videos to get most answers. Still have problems with it but was too late to return.  Son played with it a couple of times and never again.
5,Happy Gamer,"My new controller arrived on time and has been gaming hard every since. Seems to be a decent enough controller. The finish isn't as smooth as the older models, but I like the soft texture feeling. Easily sync'd with my Xbone and my chargeable battery pack fit perfectly. It is really nice to have a new controller that doesn't continue to walk when I release the thumb stick. The 3.5 jack works without issue with my regular Xbone headset. If you need a good controller for a decent price, grab this."
5,Destiny never looked better,I'm loving this console and game. I'm a huge destiny fan and my wife purchased this console and a 4K monitor for me as my early birthday presents. Destiny was always a beautiful game but to see its sequel running in 4K is fantastic. The console is running extremely well and I have no complaints. I'm hoping that future Sony exclusives like God of War and the sequel to The Last of Us will take advantage of the 4K power of the PS4 Pro. This will be my console until PS5 comes out in a few years.
1,Did not include everything,When I opened the box there was no headset and the code for the division was missing inside the box
5,Looks as pictured,"Looks exactly as pictured, good quality."
5,Perfect Nostalgia,Item exactly as described. Keep in mind if you run this on Windows 10 you will have to get a patch for it to run. By no means is that the seller's fault. The disks were beautifully unscratched and run wonderfully.
1,Sucks!!,"The visuals are choppy, it glitches a lot. Cant even get passed the initial tutorial with out freezing."
1,Didn't work,"I purchased this item as a gift to my brother who lives overseas. I got the item way before one of the family members went back to my country and when they got the item it didn't work. Since the time frame was very long, I wasn't able to return the item or get refunded. I learned my lesson. If you are sending this overseas, make sure that you open the package and try it out, or you will probably lose your money like I did."
1,It sucks that I had to be the suckered that had ...,False advertising!!! On discription of this item. Recieved it and it was in Japenese and could not be converted to english. Since raising a fuss and returning my item I have noticed they have changed the discription of this item. It sucks that I had to be the suckered that had to deal with the mess.
5,Quick turnaround time.,We are using it for Nintendo switch. We love it because so quickly.
4,Decent for the most part.,I had for about a month everything is the good only thing is sometimes it hard to talk when the mic can be close to you and people can't hear you.
4,Really nice charger station!,"I got this product to charge my new PS5 controllers.  I didn't want something that had the PS5 controllers sitting upside down, it just looked stupid so I chose this one.  This station has small adapters that fit into your controller and then interface with the charging station.  It works well but I did have to knock off a single star for the fit, you do have to pay attention when sitting them down that the charge is hitting (see pics) and don't go to use later and have no charge.  Other than that these have worked great for me and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them for PS5 users.  The lights on the front indicating charging are small but viewable and not intrusive to viewing.  RECOMMENDED PURCHASE!"
4,I made a huge mistake by putting it on my wishlist,I'm 13 and I have to admit i absolutely love polly pocket. I put this game on my christmas wishlist and recieved it. The mini games are cute and fun but i beat the game in 35 minutes. This game is great but definately for a younger age group of 3-7! Don't make the same mistake I did unless ur buying this for a younger girl.
1,Terrible and fraud!!!!,Avoid this game at all costs I purchased two and both deleted everything in seconds it's fraud!!! I really hope amazon gets rid of this seller so not pleased with this it can also damage your console due to freezing gameplay!!
1,DRM messed up my virus scanner,"Since installing this game, Windows Vista keeps telling me I do not have a Virus Scanner installed. I have the latest version of McAfee and Vista correctly identified it until I installed this game. I have read on several blogs that this is a known issue with the software EA uses to protect the game."
4,This is AMAZING,"I love the PSVR. I had the Samsung gear vr, and that hurt your forehead and eyes after 10 minutes of using it. The PSVR is comfy and does not hurt. The graphics were not as good as I hoped. But still better than gear vr. I guess VR is still fairly new so it will get better just like PlayStation and Xbox did. You need to make a motion controller with joysticks. All the games I have use a normal ps controller because you wouldn't be able to move around with a motion controller since it has no joystick. It has a lot of annoying wires, but I guess it has to, so whatever. When your wearing it you can see light coming in from around the edges. It need bigger rubber pieces to block that out. It constantly says I'm out of view if I turn my head to much. That might just be because I'm to far away or because my camera it a little old. But its still amazing and im very happy with it. Im looking forward to new games and hopefully better PSVR models"
5,RGB is everything,there is a lot of rgb on this thing but not a lot of click except for the space bar because of the rubber underneath for water proofing. but it is goooooood for gaming and fortnite
5,Works really well for PS4 and also my 3rd party ...,"Works really well for PS4 and also my 3rd party Android controller by Gamersir. HOWEVER, DO NOT try to rip off original PS4 grips from the joysticks. This thumb grip will not fit a PS4 joystick correctly if the original grip is removed. I made this mistake and the thumb grip slips off of one of my PS4 controllers. My 2nd controller, which still has the remaining original grip, has no issues. I do not put this company at fault, just consider my warning."
1,Steam Suxx,"I have played all of Sid Meier's versions of Civ 1 to 5. I like them, but don't bother with this one.  Just keep playing 4.  STEAM SUXXX!  I just wanna play the game and I can't there from here cause Steam won't let me.  You cannot play the game unless Steam is running.  Steam is inaccessible half the time and takes 5-10 minutes to open.  And their customer support is non-existent."
5,This Charging Cable works for the Corsair Harpoon!,"Lost the charging cable to my corsair harpoon, which happened to have the absolute most obscure MicroUSB port location I have ever seen as well as an appropriately strange charger. This cable fits perfectly and aligns with the guide tracks. If you were in my situation, look no further. it IS a bit expensive for a MicroUSB charging cable though..."
5,I like it,So far so good. It works well with my pc without any signal issues. I wish it could work wirelessly while charging.
5,GOOD AFFORDABLE GAMING MOUSE,My son loves this mouse. It has adjustable dpi up to 7000 dpi so it shouldn't be hard to find a good preference for your needs. He plays alot of pc games and fortnite being a current popular one he is getting better and people are starting to accuse him of using aimbot cheats (he does credits the mouse). He likes the feel of it and gives him good results with his gaming. I would recommend this mouse to gamers on a budget.
5,Xbox,Works great. Built in wifi is a very nice addition. Large hard drive makes game saves and installed games easy and you don't have to worry about filling it up any time soon. Great product
1,DISAPPOINTMENT OVERLOAD,"My daughter opened this box for Christmas and the very expensive box was filled with INDEX CARDS AND AN OPEN PACK OF DIRECTIONS AND A RUBBER BANDED CHARGER! I AM BEYOND FURIOUS AND DISBELIEF!  Because I have to pick a star for a rating I chose one, but that is not accurate as I would not rate this any star"
5,I waited patiently for this release,I've been playing Edge of Eternity since it was on Early Access on Steam and I'm happy to support the developers with a physical copy. The cover art looks gorgeous!
2,Potential for fun but plagued by problems,"Aside from the server problems, the game frequently crashes and is generally unstable.  The customer experience has been terrible in my first week with this product. Several features are disabled as they continue to work on the title.  It feels like amateur hour - I'd avoid this title until all of the customer issues are resolved.  From a design standpoint it seems like it has a lot of potential for fun but the experience is destroyed by terrible execution and an 'always online' requirement.  I feel that EA has damaged the SimCity brand and I will certainly never pre-order an EA title again after this and other (Spore) launch disasters."
2,No adapter for older Xbox360.,"Does not include adapter for older models of Xbox360, had to order one. The cable included is only for the newer models of Xbox360. Noticed some scratches on the unit as well. Once the adapter I ordered comes in I will try to update this review."
5,People need to stop complaining. Also awesome game!,"Wow I don't understand all these one stars for the servers being down. This is a huge release obviously there will be issues and they patched it up really quick. People complaining about this being online only need to relax because it's been this way since it was announced three years ago. Anyway the game is fun and challenging I played the open beta and they made a lot of improvements. It is an rpg so keep I mind that it'll take more than one shot to kill enemies. The graphics are beautiful the gameplay is really fun. Look, I can understand why this game won't appeal to everyone but just because it's not your favorite doesn't mean it's not someone else's. I can see myself logging months into this game trying to get the best loot."
5,Pure fun and online works day one.,"This is great, online works day 1, caters to all skill levels and it is unique. There is NOTHING like this out there"
5,SONIC BOOM!!! SONIC BOOM!!! SONIC BOOOOOOOOOM!!!,"I've been waiting for this game to come out ever since I saw the teaser of the game came out last February, its basically a mix between sonic rush (for the ds) and sonic rivals ( for the psp). The game play is addicting, the characters are great, the task of finding crystals and blue prints is fun and overall a great experience. Sanzaru Games did any amazing job, but know that this is mainly targeted towards kids and new sonic fans, but even if your an old sonic fan like me I would still recommend giving this game a try!"
5,Great Value,"Four different games included in this one package. They are older games but very good variety. Not as fast paced and in depth as newer, but they can still be fun to do."
5,Great for Preschoolers,I bought this for my 3 year old daughter and she absolutely loves it! Needs help initially but overall great learning tool!
5,Perfect,Amazing. Mario kart 8 was already installed and could play it right when i finished the settings. Really recommend this bundle
5,Great Quality,Just got it three days ago and it is very easy to use. I tried it with my Xbox and the control panel is pretty good. I will keep update for battery condition and it looks all good right now. Highly recommend!
1,Civ V: The Deception of Civilization,"I 've been a CIVILIZATION fan for years. I own all the versions. Now I decided to try this one . My mistake: not to read all opinions about this version... Simply:few 'pros' and lots of 'cons'. Same problems as other reviewers plus , that 'business' with Steam finally 'killed' the game. Resume: slow game play, constant 'pop-ups' of orders and advices, not what one expected from a Civilization (new) version game.My advice to 2K and to Mr Sid Meier: Review  and re-do the game or change everything as used to be before for a possible new version: I believe players prefer to pay a little more money for MORE DVDs in order to LOAD the game into the computer's  hard drive, rather than use STEAM or anything similar to play it !."
4,Fun Game,"Elements is an interesting game. It's different than others. It's a puzzle-type game with nice graphics, sound and design. Very much worth twenty bucks."
5,Funcional,Funcional
5,Quite a good collector's edition.,The game is proving to be quite fun.  But the items in the box are amazing. The Statue of Joule and Mack is huge and beautifully detailed. The steelbook is simple but I still like it. The lithograph is a nice touch also.
1,Not what you expect,The developer should spend more time adding content and less time coming up with slick marketing to sell sub par addons.  I felt the description of the DLC was extremely deceptive
5,XBOX 360 Transfer Cable,I Bought this July 14 2010 The shipping was incredibly fast. I needed this to transfer my information from my old xbox to the new xbox and this cable was great it tranfered all my information.
1,There should be a disclaimer regarding using this with the ...,There should be a disclaimer regarding using this with the VITA SLIM model. I feel wronged. It is too tight of a fit and after only two weeks of use it f'ing screwed up my brand new vita slim. It pushes too tight on the top and bottom and squeezes the vita together which DAMAGES it. Now I noticed the plastic and SCREEN near the volume buttons is slightly popping apart and I have to push it back together constantly. If you own a newer vita I seriously hope you read this review....
5,The Best Smash for your Money,"If you've been into Smash Bros.  since its early days, or have ever wanted to get into the series this is the best entry point for newcomers. With every character that has been in all the previous games back and this one, plus a good number of newcomers, and with more on the way in the form of DLC. Many quality of life changes have made this more accessible to beginners while also helping you train to get better to reach a more competitive level. There are hundreds of hours of playtime in this for a single player, but of course the best fun is with friends and family."
4,Excellent game but same AI and layout problems,"Let me start by saying I think that the Medal of Honor series are my favorite games for the Playstation, being a huge WWII buff.  I bought Frontline the day it came out, and it is a fantastic game, but I was a bit disappointed overall.  The sound continues to be a great strength of the series, but the graphics are very similar to the last 2 MOH games.  They are definitely better, but with the PS2 I was expecting more fluid movement.  Also, I was hoping for a little more realism out of this one, but it still has the same problems as the last one--Germans stay standing and continue to fire after being shot in the chest or don't notice a bullet whiz by their ears, they catch and hold onto grenades while still firing, and seem to have no military training outside of returning fire (they never try to lay down a base of fire then flank you, they are very predictable in their movements, etc.)  On top of this, the game is fairly easy to beat in a short time, and there is no multi-player, which was half the fun of the other ones.  Don't get me wrong, I love this game and the series (and look forward to the next one), and I'd recommend anyone to get this game.  But be advised that it is basically the same as the first one except it has a better look and sound to it--this is not an ultra-realistic game but well worth the price.  For more WWII info:  ..."
5,Love Prime Day,I love prime deals and I love Xbox gold and game pass. Little tricky to figure out but finally realized that all I needed to do was look in my email for my code lol.
1,One of the worst games I've played in years,One of the worst games I've played in years. You have to constantly eat and drink to stay alive. YOU HAVE TO PAY for more then 1 save slot. WTH is that about? When going into multiplayer you are often paired up against enemies 15 levels higher then you and that's with people in your party around your level. Game doesn't auto save after major milestones. I buy over 50 games a year and never write a review. That's how much this game is horrible.
1,Horrible. Does not even work!!!,I am telling you now. Do not buy this product. It does not install correctly and will not work. The download that helps this problem that is on the website is does not work either. The support team for this product does not help either. Save your money for something else.
1,Useless,"Was hoping to use these for PUBG, they move all over the screen when you move your thumb. They make it worse. Save your money and do NOT buy."
5,Works like a charm!,Works like a charm!  I can now play my Wii on my new tv!
5,Best gaming accessory,"As a casual gamer, Gaimglass has been super helpful in getting me to be more competitive without putting in a ton of hours. Oh and set up took less than a minute. Really happy with the purchase."
5,Best Black Friday in years thank you Nintendo,Easiest Black Friday EVER
1,"WARNING, NOT A GAME!","This is not a game whatsoever. I figured one would just have to put it it their xBox 360 and would be able to play Minecraft. This product doesn't even come close. You insert it into your gaming machine and nothing happens. This product should not be listed as a game PERIOD, because it is NOT!"
1,DRM is a malignancy,"EA will have to learn the hard way that treating honest customers like pirates only encourages piracy and discourages everyone from buying their games.  Like Spore, Crysis employs a highly invasive DRM program.  I refuse to spend my hard-earned money on any product made by EA, as long as EA chooses to use DRM.  I just purchased a game from a manufacturer that put no DRM on its game, and treats its customers with respect (Stardock Games).  I am always happy to purchase games that don't use idiotic DRM."
5,Awesome,Made my sons xbox1 look awesome he loves it
5,Great and Greater,I know that you probably don't want to read a review for a product that has not even been released but listen anyway. I have these games (I bought them seperately) and know about the product. Don't listen to Product description- This is Age Of Empires !2! and its expansion!!!!!!!! The game itself is a beauty and the online play and custom scenarios just add for nearly unlimited replay value. I would reccomend this for a person who wants a slightly cheaper package of both games.
2,Game got boring,Got sea sick playing. Game got boring fast
1,Do Not buy this.,Civ5 Gods and Kings added religion components that do not work properly in the game. The game is extremely buggie and slow to cycle between players. This newest version of Civ5 is unplayable and the game is no longer enjoyable.
1,I can't believe I wasted my Money,"What a disappointment! I could not wait for this game to come out. I FINALLY get it home and I have to download a ton of garbage software including the security software that everyone is so pissed about. TWO HOURS of BS later I finally get the game to start up. Then the next kick in the balls, my controller is not supported! I call some lame tech support and they tell me that only the XBOX 360 controller for Windows is supported. I can't believe I waited all this time for such a letdown. Rockstar Games should really be ashamed. I expected sooooo much more. Now I have to go pay for some overpriced controller. I really wish I had bought a different game."
4,The Legend of import.,"I got what i bought, to my surprise it was a Malaysian import, not to edgy with this because it works well and all but item description should include this detail. Otherwise im enjoying the game and the import makes no difference so far."
5,Two for the price of one.,"They're not that durable and the quality is not that great but for certain games they do the job well especially is you like having one ear uncovered, and one of these used is about 12 dollars at gamestop. This is two brand new ones. As long as you've used these before and know what your getting or dont have super high expectations its a good deal."
1,false price,"This item is not 1.27... I tried ordering 4, for a total of about 5 bucks and they tried to charge me 25 for shipping and handling.. don't be fooled by the price. They will jack up the prices an insane amount in shipping and handling. There are better places to buy this product that won't charge an arm and a leg for the shipping."
5,5 stars because I like the color red,Just a tad over 16k is cheap for protection of my 300 dollar system. It did everything I could have asked and sent me into crippling debt. 5 stars because I like the color red.
5,Great Game,"Purchased for my 10 year old daughter who takes English riding lessons.  She loves the game.  Her first reaction when she started to play was ""Mom, it's so real"".  She has no complaints about the game execpt when I tell her she has been playing long enough, now go outside for awhile!"
1,Dont waste your time,"This is a complete waste of time and money, do not buy it!!! I kept the case to hold the umd's and psp,until i can get a better one,but got rid of everything else!!!"
2,"Uninspired storyline, fun mini-games","Storyline is as amateur as they get. You'll spend hours furiously tapping 'A' to get through unending dialog about how Sonic and Mario are stuck in a retro game. This weak premise is repeated over and over until you decide to abandon the campaign mode altogether and just play the mini games. The mini games themselves are pretty fun. I loved rock climbing, swimming, martial arts."
5,Expansion for the 2003 Game of the Year,"let me say this, if you enjoyed Call fo Duty for the PC then this is a must have.  it adds over 10 new single player missions and 3 new multiplayer MODES.  the multiplayer on the original was great and this is going to add 3 new modes and over 10 new maps.  this game also has great mods which are free and add a lot more conent to a game.  i say this is definatley a must have!"
4,Great game disregard the bad reviews .,If you like 3rd person hack and slash with weapon customization attribute leveling and magical abilitys that you can also upgrade you will love this game. You play as Fury a young attractive woman and one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. She's hot deadly and fun to play . The boss battles are epic and the game overall is very fun to play  It's not a Dark Souls game at all not sure why that's being thrown around. Combat is based on her whip chain attacks and magic havoc attacks. I could go deeper into this but I think you get the gist . Graphics are very good the controls are tight and the 3rd person camera never gets janky .It's a lot like devil may cry with a female protagonist and better combat .
5,Great Buy!,"The price on this Xbox One was great. I saw some of the reviews that said the unit that they received was used, and I was a bit worried. However, mine appeared to be new and packaged in the original packing with no sign of it having been used or refurbished. I have only used it for a few days, but so far, it is working perfectly and I couldn't be happier."
1,No Motion Plus,This was supposed to be with motion plus built in. Remote does not have the motion plus built in. I am disappointed and will be returning.
5,The Best Flying Game Ever!!!,"Combat Flight Simulator 3: Battle for Europe is a great game. Its only fun when you have the joystick. You can pick from German, British and American planes. Its more realistic than Combat Flight Simulator 2. You can even fly bombers and be a gunner. The missions are alot harder than the ones in Combat Flight Simulator 2. Most of the time you get shot down by flack. Now you can crashland. It was anoying when you crash landed and just stayed there forever in Combat Flight Simulator 2. You can get medals. Its easy to get them. Its hard to live through bombing misions because the flack and the blast from the bombs make you crash. If you liked Combat Flight Simulator 2 you will probably like Combat Flight Simulator 3. Its impossible to shoot down planes with the amount of amo they give you but you can go to settings and put unlimited amo on. The fuel is very annoying. You allways get hit in the fuel tank. You allways lose all you fuel. Theres 3 bombers and alot of fighter planes. You can get topedos now. Theres almost no ships so there useless. Theres even multiplayer and campain mode. Theres also alot of locations to fly in. Combat Flight Simulator 3 is the best."
5,Bought this as a present for my night-owl husband. ...,Bought this as a present for my night-owl husband. He loves that he doesn't have to leave a lamp on just to type or game. And he says that it's much quieter than his previous keyboard.
5,Impressive for its size.,"What impressed me the most is the actual size and weight compared to the original dock! You can fit this almost in you pockets. Everything works as described and what is best, is that you can also just use it as a stand (which is way better than the flimsy kick stand the screen has). Over all I would recommend it for its practicality. Also great customer service!"
5,"Probably a gimmick in the long run, probably not ...","Probably a gimmick in the long run, probably not going to be supported in 2 years or superseded before that by incompatible hardware. BUT WHO CARES I AM THE BATMAN OMG ALFRED GET IN HERE CHECK ME OUT I AM THE NIGHT!"
5,Great product,"The item works exceptionally well, especially for the price. You get a battery charger, 2 packs and a wired adaptor for the controller. All function properly and as they should. the packs retain a charge for quite awhile and charge quickly. Its going on a couple months now and they are still going strong."
5,Fun for young boys,"I have 2 boys, ages 4 and 6, who love the Cars movie and racing games, so this is perfect.  They've played this game on the Wii over and over again.  Even my 4 year old, who has been hesitant about playing the Wii, started playing this game and loves it."
1,Used game even though I bought a brand new game.,"Why was I sent a damaged , discolored Europeon version ? Was this used? There's scratches all on the inside of the case and the front cover as well..."
5,Easy to use. Fits Perfectly.,"There weren't any reviews for this when I bought it, but I gave it a chance anyway. Minimal packaging, in a very good way. Thing seems sturdy enough. Holds my caseless iPhone 11 Pro no problem. Would recommend."
5,American Conquest,"This game is a enhanced version of Cossacks, with extreamly good RTS features and with the ablity to have 16,000 units it gets tence. If you liked Cossack or Age of Empires this is a great buy."
2,Bands Don't Stay Tight,"I bought these after seeing a good review and hoped they would improve the ergonomics of my Oculus Quest controllers. Installation was a little difficult due to the poor instructions; I had to find a video online to make sure I was installing them correctly. I have medium-size hands, and the extra bulk of these repositions my hand slightly so some of the controller buttons are not as easy to reach. The biggest problem I have with them though is that the bands that wrap around the back of your hand are not securely held in place. They feel good when you first put them on and tighten them up, but over the course of a few minutes they slowly get loose and then you have to fumble around trying to tighten them back up. It's really annoying. If they improved the clamp mechanism so the bands stayed put, I would give this four stars."
5,Exactly what I wanted,The seller shipped the controller hours after I bought it. I recieved the controller in three days. The controller does exactly what it's advertised for. Great buy.
1,Not compatible with the latest Mac OS -10.7!,I had to return this immediately after purchase as it is not compatible with my new iMac running the latest version of OSX.  One of the games will not load.  I called the company and they said they had no plans to fix it or push out an update even though the version sold through the Apple store did get a patch to fix the problem.  They suggested I send it back.
1,Outlandish prices,Obscene prices
1,I loved the controller,"I loved the controller, but after a little over a month the joystick part quit working.  I just started blinking however; the function keys at the bottom T1 thru T6 continued working but the joystick itself was dead.  I tried different USB ports and even downloaded the Logitech X52 H.O.T.A.S software to program it, nothing seemed to work.  I so wanted to keep this device but I had little to no time in the usage of it and with the little I did use of it, then it breaks.  Had to return it, did not want to, did a little research on the device and found out it has a bad engineering flaw.  The flange were the wire's go up through the Joystick move around and it has a slight edge to it and could possible cut into those wires, thus causing the issue. Not sure this was mine though or if it was a Windows 10 update that happen just prior to my using it."
4,Great game!,I enjoy playing this game but man players are really good! You have to really know how to manage your resources. It's not like playing StarCraft where you just mine for minerals and gas. This is a whole different ball game.
5,"A gentle ""game""","I got Flower because I wanted to be able to do something on my sons' new PS4 that wasn't sports (their thing) or violent (none of our thing). This is a beautifully nice game that anyone can play. You start with a flower and go on progressively different and slightly more challenging journeys to activate the blooming of flowers across vast landscapes. You ride the wind, the wind pushes, but it is almost relaxing--only the most competitive will find ways to get upset over this. Lovely. :)"
5,Works Great With XBox 1 Controller,I bought this for my grandson so he can play fortnite. He says it works great and he even got a spare in case of an accident. The first one I got him got mashed when he dropped the controller.
5,"Just when I Thought Splinter Cell Couldnt get any better,,,this came out",This Game is freaking sweet! Every move you make dictates how well you are trusted in either the NSA or the terrorist group: JBA you infiltrated. You have to be even more caculating then in all the other games. This game in some levels you are playing with a teammate (not coop but in single player). The Graphics are what you would expect from Splinter Cell: The Best the PS2 can offer. I would strongly recommend this game to you if you like the splinter cell series.
5,Absolutely Awesome,"I love this charging station. It can charge 4 remotes at a time with the Wii Motion Plus installed with the silicon cover. It is so nice to be able to charge it without taking all the accessories off. The one minor flaw is that the charging indicator lights are a bit too bright I think, but no big deal. This is an awesome product!!!"
4,Not what I expected,"This is a decent headset if you're using it for PC gaming. There is no noise cancelation. The loudest volume is not that loud to be honest. The LED lights needs the USB to be plugged in which is on the wire next to the plug you would put into your controller. You can use it for Playstation or Xbox but you can't use LED unless you have some sort of attachment on your controller with a USB port. I guess I should have expected this since it wasn't too expensive although for this product I think the price is a lot. This is equivalent to a 15 dollar headset based on sound quality, no noise cancelation and the LED lights not being able to be plugged in especially if you're playing on Playstation."
4,Not Just for Gamers,"Not a bad set of headsets. I don;t use them for gaming, but more for Skyping and the like. Somemay find them too ,much for such a use, but for me, they are just right. The sound quality is pretty good for a relatiuvely inexpensive headset. The design is well thought out and I love the way the microphone tucks in. Surprisingly comfortabel evenfor long durations for a closed-style headset."
1,DRM won't stop piracy--but it sure stops sales.,"I came here today because I was seriously thinking of buying this innovative game. It took me about 30 seconds--the time required to read a couple of explanations of the DRM nonsense--to change my mind. Good bye, Spore."
1,This is not like the others.,Do not buy this game!
1,Small waste of internet space,I love star wars but the PvP is garbage and the instances are boring the game is pretty much over at lvl 50. Its an really poor knock off of wow but in space.
1,Pale Imitaion,"This game was made for the console only, all the great things about the first one have been taken out, from the skill sets, ammo, reloading, the inventory. Everything has been super simplified so now its a FPS not an action rpg. ALso your looking about around 15 hours of gameplay. The most revolutionary thing they did in this game was put in the console market nowing it it is going to sell well becuase it has a great name. FOrgot to mention a very weak AI and no head shots or body specific damage like the first one. They should of named it DIET Deus Ex"
1,"Dont write a bad review, these guys will sue you","Dont write a bad review, these guys will sue you, seriously. They are taking 100 steam users to court for bad reviews and having opinions. They are suing a youtube reviewer for givinh their horrid games a bad review. Valve was fed up with them and removed all their games, now they are  here. This game is terrible, horrible, and buggy. I couldnt play it for more than 5 minutes then  i deleted it and got a refund."
4,Good for the price,"Fairly comfortable, sound is good. Connection to pc worked first time"
1,No split screen,"No split screen? Are you KIDDING me? This game's entire purpose was pizza rolls, Mountain Dew, and FRIENDS. I wish I had known this before I ordered because it was a huge disappointment"
5,Great,Awesome perfect for the switch
5,Fun Game,My girls (8 and 13) have spent many fun hours playing this game. They both gave it five stars.
5,"Spectacular, the best original third-party Wii title yet","From the makers of Killer 7, No More Heroes is the anxiously awaited bloodbath that mature Wii owners have been praying for.  Playing as eccentric assassin Travis Touchdown, you are armed with your trusty beam katana as you set out to become the best in the business.  There is much more to the story than that though, but without giving too much away regarding the game's surprisingly deep and complex story, let's just say that things don't always go as planned for Travis.  The first thing you'll notice are undoubtedly the excellent, cell-shaded graphics that No More Heroes sports, along with the best use of the Wii motion controls to come from a third-party yet.  The game also features some GTA-inspired free roaming with Travis on a motorcycle, and while it isn't as open-ended as one would hope, the game's serious sense of style and just plain insane story and gameplay elements more than make up for it.  The game also has a somewhat jittery frame-rate that can become quite noticable when the action picks up a lot, but this is only a minor complaint thanks to the stylized, over the top action, along with flawless sound design and elements that really take advantage of what the Wii can do, despite the fact that the console isn't a technical powerhouse.  All in all, No More Heroes is the absolute best, original third-party title to debut on the Wii yet, and is an absolute essential purchase for Wii owners craving a mature-themed game that leaves a lasting impression."
1,It feels like they released a half finished product here,"I've been playing NASCAR games since Bill Elliott's racing experience on nes... And well when i saw this available for pre purchase i had no choice but to order a copy. Well i wish i hadn't. The gameplay is choppy, having to unlock tracks is a joke. Where are my caution flags? It feels like they released a half finished product here. Maybe my expectations were too high, but i was really let down with this game. If they can get it together and fix the problems I'll update this review as for now i can't recommend this game to anyone."
1,Did not get what I ordered,"I ordered the Early Tip-Off Edition which is supposed to include the game, the bonus content and a MyPLAYER apparel item. I never got my apparel item."
4,Good Product,"This was exactly what I needed for my Xbox.  I didn't want to spend 100 dollars on a microsoft 250 gb memory because I really didn't need that much, I just needed more than the 4gb the console had.  I was a little worried when I order this Hard Drive because I thought it wasn't going to work or I was never going to get it, but after like a month or something like that I received it in the mail.  It was really easy to install and it worked great.  The only weird thing is that my xbox said there was like 105 gbs free when it was new and it should've had 120...i dont know why that happened but I really don't care because I'm good with 100 more gbs and it only cost me 50 bucks."
5,the perfect game!,"When my father bought a new computer Fate happened to be one of the free trial games on it.  Well, i thought it looked interesting enough and i liked the fact you get a faithful pet sidekick (i own a Jack Russell Terrier) and gave it a whirl. SIX HOURS later i still couldn't stop playing!!  The world created within is utterly fascinating and a whole lot of fun.  I don't play computer games often so this is new for me.  The graphics are absolutely beautiful, the movement and action is smooth and fascinating (especially when casting spells!)  Choose your own character and build him or her to be a warrior or magician or BOTH. Gather objects to keep or sell and gain experience points as you complete tasks for the villagers.  The more points you have the more awesome things you can do.  Gain a reputation, earn money and buy armor and spells to be a force to be reckoned with.  This is a simple game to play even if you've never done RPG before.  It's not bloody or graphic like some action games and your pet can't die! (feed him health potions to keep him healthy) Go fishing and catch totally crazy things (like i pulled a sword and helm out of a fish!)  There really isn't anything else to say except this is a game that is completely worth it at any age. Go buy it already!"
5,Great for MIsTER and Windows 10,Works great with the MISTER with a USB board. I was even able to Use two controllers at once for two players on the Sega Genesis and SNES cores. It also works on windows 10 as a usb game controller
5,better than melee,dont care what anyone says but this game is better than melee
5,... games or the games with sleeves don't fit too good in the game holder,The metal case games or the games with sleeves don't fit too good in the game holder. It's great other than that.
1,I had high hopes that crashed to the ground after playing.,This game looked cool in the trailers and I bought it on release day and the online experience is horrible. Connection issues that make this game unplayable.
1,DO NOT BUY ITS A SCAM,"I bought these because of the reviews which are totally incorrect. I purchased two of them because the were such a good deal. THEY BROKE RIGHT AWAY. Both of them. The scam is, that you pay so much for the shipping that it is not worth it to send them back and now you just have junk."
1,Bragging Rights,This book was more about a person telling how bad they are instead of a person doing a job for there country. Just giving someone a licence to kill and brag about it because they were in the position to do so is not much of a statement for our military. This is not the kind of book to give our troops an image of respect they deserve.
1,Wrong item version being sold than whats pictured.,I recieved what appears to be the new revision. The mesh now where the switch goes in is a pos. Why doesn't Amazon update the product picture of whats really being sold. Now im going out of town with no case.
5,Great way to pass time on a long trip...,"The Game Boy Color is the best portable gaming system around. It's made all my  plane trips go by a lot faster, and for me, that makes it worth the reasonable price. There are hundreds of games out for the Game Boy Color, and many more to come. There are games in all genres, including Adventure, Arcade, Fighting, Racing, Sports, and RPG-- start your GBC Collection with Super Mario Bros. Deluxe and Tetris DX, the two classics. It's small enough to put in your jacket pocket, and the game cartridges are tiny. The only problem is that you can't play it in the dark because it isn't backlit, so you have to buy an extra light to attach onto it. But cons aside, the Game Boy Color is a great investment for hours of entertainment-- at least until summer 2001, when the Game Boy Advance comes out (which will also play Game Boy Color and Game Boy Games). But until then, I recommend the Game Boy Color to Kids and Adults alike!"
2,can't see the cards,"Euchre and hearts, when you are holding the cards you can't tell if it is a club or spade on the left side because your character is in the way. I am planning to take the game back because I am so disappointed in it."
1,Can't wait for 2k football to come back !,Last bought a football game in 2005 (2k) and Madden 05. Madden collected dust while I played 2k Football daily. .. 2k5 (2005) was better than today's Madden 22.
1,i request change article,"Yesterday i received my package, however, the disc is bent, i took some pictures before opening the disc, please indicate you are responsible for changing the disc?"
1,Riddick Assault on Dark Athena,I was going to buy this game because I loved the first Riddick game. But I could not find any info on the specs of the game. I then found out that it has DRM and limited installs. I tried to get info of mim operating specs from ATARI that was a month ago. I think after the three installs that Atari should have to return any money paid to them. Unless Atari changes I do not think I will ever buy any games from them again. Pc or console.
5,Great PC Remote,"I use this remote to control the Snapstream Beyond TV 3 application (great PVR software for live tv and recording TV shows) and the included Beyond Media Basic software (very similar to a Windows Media Center interface for viewing photos, playing music, etc).  The remote works great, the button layout is very intuitive and the RF type- recevier and transmitter provides excellent range (I have tested at 40 feet through walls and it worked perfectly).  On top of the that, the Snapstream website has an excellent support forum.  Highly recommended!"
1,Infested with Roaches!,"ROACH feces fell out of the packaging when I opened it. We didn't know initially, so we put it in our closet. 2 hours later (8pm), we found 12 roaches crawling all over our upstairs. I thought the black stuff from the package was dirt, turned out to be roach feces. We were putting it in our room so it is all over our bed. They were living inside the game consul. After looking at the packaging closer, we found other dead, half eaten roach bodies. We had to package up the linens and put them outside, call an exterminator, and find a place to stay for 2 days. I was having surgery the next day so it has made a huge impact on my family. The amount of work we have to do just for the extermination is crazy plus now pay a huge bill. Amazon contacted the seller and said we needed a returnless refund. The seller responded and said he wants us to package it back up,  have it shipped back and then will refund us the money. It didn't arrive on time, we had no idea it was coming from Venezuela! The unit was dirty, scratched, and there was electrical tape holding the connecting cable together. Do not take a chance with this!! Trust me, it's not worth the amount of work we now have to do. I have a toddler and a special needs child that I do not want to take the chance of getting sick from these."
5,Great for tryharding,"If you intend on tryharding on your switch games this controller is great. Honestly, if you just play on your switch a lot you should probably get it. I've heard drift on the switch's base joycons is a big problem. I've not had to deal with it personally because I've been using this controller. I bought it April 2021. 2yrs ago pretty much and it hasn't had any drifting issues and can last several hours before needing to be charged. I've played super smash bros, pokemon unite, hyrule warriors - just to name some of the more click intensive games on my list. Comfortable to use too, or at least for me it's comfortable. Felt like a natural transition from using the joycons in that lil weird controller combo that comes with the switch to this controller now."
1,Very disappointed this was not stated clearly,Heads up requires play station plus to play.  This is not stated in the description for game of the year.  Do not but unless you have play station plus or are willing to pay a monthly subscription. Very disappointed this was not stated clearly.
5,Silicone vs TPU review,"I went ahead and got both the black silicone and tpu versions so I could compare them. They both fit well and everything lines up great. The insides of the handles on the silicone version has some ribbing so they don't collapse or squish when held. I like that the power and volume buttons are covered as well as the sd card door. The buttons have a better tactile feedback in the silicone case. The stand feature works ok on a hard surface, but the case these ones replaced had a better stand. I'm using the silicone version for now as I like how it feels, but I'm sure with time it will stretch out like all the other silicone cases I've dealt with over the years on phones. Only the tpu case came with a screen protector, both came with the thumbstick covers (though I don't use them)."
1,Poor quality,Extremely disappointed with this controller. While pretty it's barely 4 months old and the left thumb stick gets stuck in thd right position causing the redical to go right. Also vibrate is on and off randomly. Poor quality.
5,"Slick, responsive, and royal.","It's a beautiful GameCube-style controller with the pallette inspired by Princess Peach, and it feels great with a textured grip in the back to make sure slipping of the hands is a rare occurrence and that gameplay is as optimal as can be. Feels great in the hands and looks great when not in use. HORI really knocked it out of the park with this one - especially with the translucent shell."
4,A parent's perspective,"The bundle pack contains everything that my daughter wanted to go with her DS; however, the game player case itself seems to be very flimsy.  Although my daughter takes very good care of her things, the zipper on the case broke the first day she got it (Christmas Day).  The player fits too tightly inside the case, making it difficult to close easily.  Obviously, we had to go out and buy a new case so that her DS would not get messed up when she carries it around."
4,Recommended,"This keyboard is quieter than my old thermaltake meka cherry black keyboard which surprised me.  Key travel is shorter.  The ""tactile"" feel is subtle, or at least it isn't that noticeable to me.  If anything I would say the actuation resistance has zero travel time from the top of the keystroke then it's smooth all the way to the bottom.  The only thing I don't like is that you can't control light intensity when using the AIMO intelligent lighting setting as I like a more subdued intensity.  This includes when that function is assigned to the ""FX""  key using the knob.  All other lighting presets can be customized. Lighting color range and customization is good.  It's not perfection but this is a very good keyboard where it counts."
1,One Star,Final Fantasy Sucks
1,Sucks,I bought my ps4 launch day to get and it has every problem that it could possibly have like it wouldn't let me play any games
5,Next Generation Yu-Gi-Oh!,"I suppose this game really depends on if you like the angsty, oh-my-god-death-eaters-run! plot or a more child-oriented, live like a rebel kid, plot. I love both. In this game, you can duel anybody you run in to really, as well as take tests (easy if you watch Yu-Gi-Oh! or Yu-Gi-Oh! GX at all). The funnest thing is probably dueling teachers... (REVENGE!!!)"
5,Blast from the past,Great game that brought me back to the good ole days of Mario Sunshine on the Gamecube. Anyone can play and it's super chill. Highly recommend it to anyone who likes a laid back game.
2,Gameboy SP charger--GENERIC,The charger did work but it is a generic charger NOT a charger like what is in the picture.  I ordered one that was pictured exactly as I was looking for and that is NOT what I got.  I notified the seller of this with no response.
1,Awful!,I don't know if anyone else has had the same problems of getting the games to work in Windows 7 but I certainly have.  It acts like an earlier version I had that wouldn't work in Windows 7. And It is deceptive about what games are on there.  There's only one choice for Dominoes instead of the multiple choices you had with the earlier games (which is why I bought it in the first place). Since I had so many pop-up warnings I finally gave up. Maybe others will have better luck.
4,Epic,In response to one of the comments... it has been made clear that your progress from diablo 3 on ps3 will carry over to the ps4 ultimate evil version. The reaper of souls expansion is dropping late march for pc. Now we just need an official ps4 release date!!!
1,Useless,"I figure this is a similar problem to the previous case. I was sold dysfunctional equipment with a broken controller which would not detect. Unless the PS3, I could begin the game, but only very slowly and without any controller response."
5,"Fun game, reminds me of a moderized version of the classic","I never owned a WiiU so I had no idea the game existed.  My family got me a Switch for Xmas as I was ""borrowing"" my teen-aged daughters to play the Untitled Goose Game a lot.  Decided I wanted to try a Mario game so I pre-ordered this one with no history on it.  Our last Nintendo system was the Wii in 2006 when the kids were younger and the I did not care for the Mario Galaxy game 3D aspect.  This, though, it seems to do an outstanding job with the classic elements of the game with some modern movement.  I am having a blast playing this one.  I'll probably end up getting the game card for both my kids.  Gives me something to do in the pandemic winter months."
5,Not what I expected and that's a good thing.,I've got to say I went into this game with a bad attitude. I primarily bought it with hope that high sales would convince atlas to port persona 5 to the switch. I am so glad I was wrong about this game. Do not judge a book by its cover absolutely applies here. I have had so much fun with this game in the last 24 hours. The battle system is a lot of fun with a twist on turned based RPGs. I like the characters. The story has kept me engaged. I can't seem to put this game down. Thanks Atlas for such a quirky and fun game.
5,Must Have,Brings in a lot of good old memories .. graphics looks good and the game play is very smooth .. trust me this is one ps4 game that everyone should have .. Uncharted will always be a masterpiece
5,Easy to get started,"Bought this for the grandkids, cough, and figured I'd start them off. Well, that's my story and I'm sticking to it. Once I figured out what I was supposed to do, it became a pleasant puzzle. The challenges are not like Tomb Raider level, but for little kids these would be sufficiently challenging, so it behooves a grandparent to stick around and guide them."
1,Disappointing,Feels like the was game made 20 years ago
5,No,Best
2,poorly designed hardware connections,"I would not recommend this product, the sound quality is superb but after only 7 months the USB connection at the volume control is failing. The micro b plug unplugs often from the weight of the wire, when the headset is no longer detected Windows switches audio devices causing my FPS game to crash."
5,Hard to put down,"Perfect for the vita.  I have a hard time putting this game down. I bought 3 games at launch Uncharted, little deviants, and Hot shots. I like them all but this is the one I just can't put down. Loads of fun and a perfect portable game.  I would hate to pay 40 bucks for it but I feel it's worth the 29.95 I paid.."
5,My first 3rd party wireless controller,"I have had this controller for about 3 days and I must say I am very impressed.  After getting used to my Xbox 360 wireless controllers I decided to go wireless for the rest of my systems.  Naturally I got the wavebird for gamecube and did some research on PS2 controllers.  I have had my ps2 for almost 4 years and have never been a fan of the dual shock 2 controller as compared to xbox controller.  This logitech controller is so much more comfortable than the dual shock controller.  I have experimented with 4 different games with this controller and I must say I have not experienced any lag.  I would take this controller over dual shock 2 controller any day.  the shape of the controller is so comfortable, its hard to believe it is 3rd party.  Sony should have had logitech design the ps3 controller.  This controller does not feel cheap in any way.  It is weighted very well and feels solid and sturdy.  It has helped me become excited about my ps2 again.  Anyone who is in the market for a wireless ps2 controller should pick this up.  I did a ton of research on ps2 controllers before picking this up and found that this got the best reviews of any other wireless controller for ps2."
5,Gaming headset,Works well for my sons who like gaming. No complaints
4,Saved my ears,Now I don't have to hear my sons friends screaming at him through his game console.
1,I remember a time when game companies had integrity....,"....But sabatoging your own supply quantities to artificially increase demand, just so you, and every other scalper online can charge 2 or even 3 times the price of the product is just wrong. Look, I understand that a business needs to make money, but not at the expense of screwing over your customer base....I will be passing on this until the price is reasonable, and even then I might skip it on principle. Whats more, companies like squaresoft are releasing DLC for PS4 titles like Final Fantasy as PS5 exclusives....When did integrity, decency, and treating customers with respect die out? This is why people are really starting to hate large corporations and their out of control greed."
2,Boring!,"I love trains, and I thought this game would be a fascinating way to play with trains.  But what I found is that it's tedious, repetivie and boring!  All you do is drive trains back and forth, and sometimes stop to pickup and drop off passengers.  When you're in a low-speed stretch of track, you just sit there for 20 min or so and wait to accelerate.  Some of the scenarios are kind of fun, but overall you put up with 30 min of boredom for 30 seconds of fun."
5,This package is actually good,"I realize that it's frustrating to have gone out and bought the game only to find it's the original Resident Evil 5 with a token for the downloadable content. But actually, if you don't already own the game, it's a really good deal. It's cheaper than how much the game was when it first came out, and the extra content is free with the token, so you really save money. So yes, Capcom wasn't clear about how this package worked, but I still rate it 5 stars because it's still a great game with a good storyline, great graphics, tons of replayability, and now extras that can be downloaded."
5,Rory Mcilroy: PGA  Tour PS4,"Being 64 years of age most of the PS4 games out there I have found that I can't play well at all. I am very happy purchasing the Rory Mcilroy golf game. It has different levels you can play and you play as slow as you want .Graphics are pretty neat, game is fun to play."
4,You Get What You Pay,"This is a very complete care package with pretty much everything you need to protect your switch on a basic level, bear in mind you get what you pay. The material quality of each piece in this bundle is just okay, like what you would get from a dollar store, so if you are looking for something that will last you and won't feel cheap spend a little extra, I sure wish I did. But, that's how online shopping goes, sometimes you get good bargains, sometimes not. By the way, the SCREEN PROTECTOR IS NOT GLASS, IT'S PLASTIC."
1,R. E. Lee  civil war general,"I cannot install the game. I get error message ""cannot run 16 bit windows program"" I have set the compatible to windows 95, 256 color."
4,Ultimate Fun!!!,"Great tutorial and hands-on learning.  This game is action-packed with fight moves, jumps, combos, etc.  My only complaint was Hulk's reaction time during running.  But that's easily overlooked when you blowing up stuff.  A definate buy!"
5,A great product!,"These thumb grips are almost as good as the real thing! I tried the raised ones, but it makes it even harder to aim in shooter games. Perhaps it would work well in a shooter where you couldn't configure the sensitivity? The two variations offer a satisfying different feel, and can be swapped out with ease. The material is highly durable, and feels like it will last as long as the controller."
5,Pretty nice so far...,"Got this headset last Friday and gamed (PS4) with it all weekend.  It is comfortable, the sound quality is great and my mic worked fine.  Overall they are great so far.  I just hope they last awhile...."
2,Fantastic Game. Horrendous Port,"I have always preferred games like Saints Row over Grand Theft Auto. The arcade-like, sarcastic nature of the characters, gameplay and source material has always captured my attention as a gamer. Saints Row on Nintendo Switch should have been a sure hit. It released back in 2011, so you would expect a game around 8 years old to be able to run well on the switch, right? Well, wrong! Despite more graphically intensive games like LA Noire, Doom or Wolfenstein running on the switch, this game feels like a rushed port job that should have been handed over to Panic Button, but instead, Volution took charge here, and it seems they dropped the ball with this one. Some of their previous games like Red Faction 1, Red Faction Guerrilla and even the ORIGINAL release of Saints Row the Third back in 2011, were made with quality, unlike this current port. Let me start off with the graphics. It looks dated, as expected, although the gamma seems to be completely out of whack with overly dark black levels(which can't be corrected with the in-game brightness toggle) and some horrendous anti-aliasing(moving lines along texture edges). If you're not moving or panning the camera, the game looks serviceable, but the problem mostly lies in the performance. The game targets 30 frames per second, and it doesn't maintain that target very often. In some indoor areas, you'll see frame-rates in the upper 20's and it feels alright, but in some areas out on the main map, the game often chugs below the upper 20's. If you happen to be in a firefight with moderate explosions, expect the game to hit single digits here and there too. Poor frame-rate(and frame time) affects two things: input response from controllers, and audio sync. This game suffers from both symptoms. Input response is incredibly slow when trying to line up a shot or direct a guided missile, and audio even lags and loses sync during some intense battles. When frame-rate is moderately stable, the audio sounds pretty good, and the dialogue is quite funny at times, but the technical problems detract from the fun in more places than I can count. The best experience with this port is to play in handheld mode, since it allows the imperfections in anti-aliasing and resolution to become less obvious, but in docked mode the game looks very blurry on a modern TV, even one with competent up-scaling. If you're one to overlook technical flaws in a game for the sole purpose of handheld capabilities such as with the switch, then you might be able to still have some fun here. The game is a blast to play when the frame rate isn't going insane, and because it contains all past downloadable content, there is well over 20-30 hours to invest in here. The other positive(if you can consider it one) is that, if you get the game physically, it is(currently) one of the few that manages to fit the entire game on the cartridge, so it won't take up any space on your internal storage or memory card. Honestly though, I'n hoping Volution takes a look at this, because it is in definitely in need of a performance patch, because right now, its not as fun to play as it should be because of its current state. It's far from broken, but it's also far from solid too. Id recommend waiting until the game is around 20 bucks."
1,This is like paying a monthly fee to use the FM receiver in your car.,"Playstation plus is a bad value. You hand over your money, and in exchange Sony.. does what? They don't host game servers (most games are still peer to peer.) They don't provide any updates beyond what non-paying customers get. The free games are almost always worth less to me than the monthly subscription cost. They don't provide any connectivity (I already pay my ISP for that.) What am I getting here? You're letting me play multiplayer? It doesn't cost you anything to do that! The only reason it's even possible for you to offer that is because you so tightly control the available software! Shame on Sony for emulating Microsoft's terrible anti-consumer ""service"" model (have to put service in quotes because no actual services are provided.)"
4,Bad box condition,"The Amiibo it self is great, but but the condition of the box was terrible. The top part of the box was squished and had many wrinkles"
5,A Fun Adventure Game provided with great shipping time,"Came in good condition and right on time. Just started the game, and as a long time Zelda fan I am thoroughly enjoying it. Wonderful game to add to my PS5 launch catalog!"
4,Reminds me of my old gameboy in high school,I bought this game for my 8 year old daughters birthday. It is a good game but I was surprised that there is no voicing you have to read the whole game. The only sound is music and random grunting lol. Gameplay is exactly like older gameboy games. But my 8 year loves it she is a die hard HTTYD fan as am I. But on the ps4 console this game could have done more. But if you liked your gameboy as a kid and like dragons it's worth getting.  But I'd wait for the price drop.
5,This Game Makes You SWEAT!,"Holy crap! This game is fantastic! The graphics are awesome, fighting style is fun, and man oh man is it a work out! My boyfriend and I both go to the gym regularly and are pretty dang fit. We played the 10 rounds contest on the easiest mode possible and were still sweating by the time we finished! This game should be called BODY because your whole body is sore after playing this but in the best of ways. This might just become part of my work out routine."
2,Not worth the money or time...,"Got this on PS4 and it's the same on the Nintendo Switch.... It boils down to it's just not a good RPG .. if you like Chrono Trigger, Secret of Mana, or FF ... you don't want to waste your money on it, ..Predictable story, no challenge, no real grinding, and it's a quick game, beat it in like 3 days of playing and paid 30 dollars for it, so when i saw the price for this, i didn't want someone to waste their money..."
5,"Case, disc, but no manual. Works great.",I was sceptacle at first due to the cheap price and very little reviews. But I got it in 3 days and everything works. No manual. But whatever. I'll be the first to show it's not a scam!
5,More like an Amazing Machine!,Just finished the demo - and if this is any indication of the final game - well the final game will be amazing!  More robust than Tomb Raider and Indy branded - a total experience. A must purchase.
5,Its awesome,I like it definitely does it's job
5,Excellent case!,Got this for my 7 year old son for Christmas and it is great! We travel frequently and it holds the charger and whatever other accessories he needs. He also takes it to his friends house all the time. It has been dropped on the ice more than once while walking to a friend's and it has protected everything inside just fine. Very happy with this purchase.
1,"Unavailable. Nintendo, you lost a fan.","Unavailable.  Nintendo, you lost a fan."
2,Makes switching more awkward and less convenient,"It's loose on the dock, but tight against the switch itself. unless you pull it upward, you end up lifting the dock up when trying to pull out the switch. for 7 cents more, you can get 3 glass screen protectors that cannot be scratched by the dock. I recommend getting a protector rather than a sock."
1,Did not work with OSX,"I could not get it to work on my Macbook Pro (not M1). I tried with several different switches, different docks and different cables. I also put in a ticket with the vendor several days ago and have not heard back. Planning on returning"
2,Wait for a sale then judge for yourself.,"Sub par animations, poor acting, and facial animations so bad they're distracting. I wanted to like this game as I'm a huge ME fan but if there's a good game buried under the issues I haven't found it. Sadly the game looks like it was developed using an old engine from a previous gen console, to the point where it feels like a technological step back."
5,This is Final Fantasy 8,"This is the same game that my mom got when I finally brought home a good grade in highschool. The story still doens't make much sense regarding child mercenaries and time traveling orphans, and how nobody seems to really care that there are a race of aliens living in part of the map.  Its still fun, and the card game is what i bought the entire game for. Its as fun as I remember."
1,Hidden requirement to redeem the key,"What they dont tell you before purchasing or in any of the subsequent instructions, is that you must be currently subscribed on the more expensive subscription option before the mogstation will even give the option to redeem a game time card. Amazon customer service wont help you when you have a problem with it, all they will do is resend you the inadequate instructions on how to apply the key that comes with the product and when that doesn't work, they tell you to talk to the developer because it's not their problem. And SquareEnix is equally unhelpful, with it no where mentioned that the more expensive sub is required to redeem the key, and if you are in NA, there is no way of getting any customer service help outside of an email they take ages to respond to. Terrible experience buying this card that seriously has soured my opinion of an otherwise good game."
5,love it,"I played worst games, but not this one is awesome I didnt get off amazon i got it off gamestop But i  like the story of it and how's its going with it, great graphics also seems really long story too. But if you love the uncharted games you will like this one I recommend it to anyone but if there was 10 stars on this I would rate it a 9.6, I'm pretty much amazed with this game!"
5,Like this game!,much fun. My wife and I often fight with each other in the game!
5,Fantastic deal,"I was looking for an easy, uncomplicated video system for my 5 year old. This has been a great answer. Easy selection of pre-downloaded games that provide variety and entertainment for hours."
1,Great Game Missing Content,Game is a fantastic follow up to the 2016 Cyber Sleuth. However I like many others have not gotten our Preorder DLC or in an even worse case scenario the code doesn't work. Bandai you made a great game and I will gladly change this to a 5 star but make it right with the DLC.
5,A great game from a good franchise that is finally getting ...,"A great game from a good franchise that is finally getting back to what it's good at. I was worried after the disaster that was Dragon Age 2, but this hit all the right notes from DA: Origins and added a few more. And I love the new Dragon Keep model, where you can go online and customize your 'starting world' experience based on who you played in the first two games and what decisions you made. It makes it easy for those of us who played it on multiple platforms (PC vs Xbox 360) to still have carry over from all our games, and not have to worry about glitches from conflicting choices. Changing your starting world makes entire sections of the game feel knew each time you play through it, and I love the variety of conversations and cut scenes that occur because of those decisions and the ones you make throughout the game. You can play it has a hack-n-slash and ignore all that if you want, but for me that's where most of the fun is. I've been through the entire game twice, and am about to finish my third run through. And even with those hours upon hours of playtime, I'm considering a fourth time just because of a few alternatives I haven't explored yet in game. I love it!"
1,beware! got a virus,"please be aware! this game makes you install ""IWin games"" and from this, which connects your computer to its site. although it is an advertising gimmick, it gave my computer two viruses back to back, which thankfully were found and removed! i uninstalled the ""IWin Games"" part, but you can't play the game without this part of it. i had a devil of a time uninstalling the whole thing, but finally managed it. the game is fantastic, but truly isn't worth the risk of a virus and i resent the fact i had to install that part of it!"
4,GOOD GAME BUT NEEDS INITIAL UPLOAD TO PLAY THE FULL VERSION,I am always a fan of 2k NBA games and it comes a bit of surprise that the cartridge just offers basic exhibition game out of the box. You need to connect to WiFi and upload the full version.
1,Awful,"I've been a Just Dance fan since day 1. I pwn everygame and have been a Just Dance unlimited almost 2 years. I hate that this is just a code and I have to download my songs in order to play offline. The track list was so disappointing, I ended up not playing at all. Maybe I am too old for this now, I am 34, but my 8, 14 and 15 year olds shared my sentiment. We were so excited for this and because it's a code, I can't even give it away. Waste of money."
2,"Console worked, but was dirty and in poor cosmetic condition","The console and controller do both work, but I thought I was buying a ""renewed console"", and RetroRefresh sent me a console that looks like they scrubed it with a magic eraser, the controller has scuffs and scratches on it, the console in general was just dirty, and it initially didn't play discs til I cleaned the laser. Maybe I got a lemon, but I would recommend buying from item bazzar instead."
5,fun fun fun,this game is even beter then mario party. you get to chose diffent nicktoons to play as.  i highly recomand this who like mario party and kingdom hearts
1,This game is a disaster,"I had high hopes for this game. But this game is a hot mess. So many bugs, glitches and CONSTANT server issues. Its a soulless void of what the Fallout world used to be. The building system sucks, the multiplayer is useless. If I could give this game a zero star review I would. This game is an annoying grinder. They really dropped the ball on this one. Bethesda would have been better off releasing a remaster of Fallout 3 or New Vegas. Hey if you like this game more power to you but I have played it everyday for over a week now and I just do not want to play it anymore. Its boring, the enemies are a waste of time and ammo because all you really get is junk from them. Bottom line: Fallout 76 is a HUGE FAIL in every aspect. It will make you go back and replay and appreciate Fallout 4. Never thought I would be glad to see Preston Garvey and do his mission and errands. Buy at your own risk"
5,excellent replacement for the original handset battery,"Worked exactly as advertised.  I was a bit hesitant to purchase a non-Wii battery, but this works perfectly.  Fit exactly into the Wii handsets, charged without a hitch, excellent replacement for the original handset battery.  Also, the light on the base, while a bit bright, makes it easy to see exactly the status of the charge.  Highly recommend."
4,Yes!  Theme Hospital and some other cool and rare games!,"This pack is neat.  Some of the games such as Sim Earth and Sim Life take time to master.  These games don't have great graphics but are fun.  Theme Hospital is my favorite.  It is hard to find unless you buy it in this pack or the other top pack.  Theme Park is in this pack but it is hard to run since it is dos.  All of the sim games are cool in here.  There is also a marble game, a poker game and a pinball game.  This pack is worth the money.  Even if you just buy it for a few of the games."
5,WOW! My kind of game!,"From the opening sequence till the titilating climax (no pun intended) Bayonetta is a rollercoater ride of sexy, crazy, over-the-top action. I love everything about the game. It screams faintly of Devil May Cry, which it should given the game was created by the same person, but Bayonetta gets my vote for favorite with its ultra sexy heroine, outrageous moves, nonsensical-yet-immersive story, smooth and detailed graphics, and all out fun. Yeah, it's kinda girly at times but throw in buckets of blood and some f-bombs and that evens things out. The game comes complete with it's own anime-styled tunes in the soundtrack conplete with lyrics!!!! It's every Japanese lovin' anime freak fanboys dream come true, which is pretty much myself and everyone I know. At any rate, I know its not gonna be everyone's cup of tea, but action fans should definitely check it out!!!"
4,Elemental View,"I'm probably one of the few ""little old ladies"" to have an Nintendo DS, but I truly like puzzle games and this one is especially enjoyable. I'd played 4 Elements as an online free version for quite awhile (see, it is a good way to promote software) and was glad to see it put out as a DS game. I haven't gotten through all four books yet and wonder what comes next, but the game is captivating, the added search at the end of each ""book"" and the decoding is a fun reward and the music is pleasant rather than jarring. If my thumbs weren't busy linking gems, I'd give this one a thumbs up."
1,BORRRRIIINNNGG,"The game isn't worth the price tag tacked onto it. Any college student who hasn't even graduated could make this in less than a few days. Maybe Sega Genesis style graphics, extremely extremely linear game play and did I mention boring. I wouldn't even buy this for a 5 year old kid to rot their brain with. Mario for regular Nintendo nearly 2 decades ago has this game beat by light years."
1,Defective product!,"The ps4 was defective. Everything seemed to work properly but when I downloaded a game, I could not open it. Every time I tried I just got an error code."
5,Classic Mass Effect...almost,"For anyone who has played Mass Effect and Mass Effect 2, then playing Mass Effect 3 is a no brainier.  The game play is solid, the graphics are great, the story is good, all the characters we all know and love return in one way or another.  Many of the reviews are low simply for one fact, the ending.  While I am not going to try and defend the ending I do not believe it can hurt what is a quality game.  In the end you will laugh and cry, if you loved or liked previous Mass Effect games get Mass Effect 3."
1,Principle,Cheating is bad mmkay
4,One of the few stuff packs that is good,I hate having to spend the money on stuff packs but this one was worth it for me. There is not a lot of content for teen rooms that I have found. I bought it for the Goth but will be using the other themes also. All in all not unhappy with this pack.
1,Damm all scaplers,Scam don't buy lol
5,Have The New Slim Vita (2000)? It will fit perfectly!,"I bought the Borderlands2 PS Vita bundle and was keeping the system in the old Vita sleeve for protection. I needed a hardshell case to keep it in because I was going on vacation and needed extra protection in my backpack. I bought this case thinking I can rig with extra bummer support seeing that the new version is slimmer. I was overjoyed when I found out the inside cutout fits the slim vita (2000) like a glove. All the cut outs on the top for the volume and power buttons line up, the camera fits in the divot in the back and there is not wiggle room!! Nice and secure in it's shock proof vault case."
5,Good quality,"I can highly recommend this headset for a very reasonable price.  The sound quality is good and I've had no complaints from others saying they can't hear me. I'm using this primarily for computer phone calls.  The headset is very comfortable when worn for long periods of time.  One downside, the cable is a bit on the short side, so I purchased an extension cable for it."
2,Disappointed,I ordered this for my kids who were thinking they would see Eye Brawl with the pumpkin head on the screen when they placed him on the portal.  It actually is no different than the regular Eye Brawl no special upgrades or anything. I feel ripped off. We already had Eye Brawl and were thinking this special one would be able to add something different. The card inside the box was the same as the standard Eye Brawl.  If my kids hadn't torn into the box with excitement then I would be returning it for sure.  Lesson Learned.
2,Sub par,"I have owned all the call of duty titles, and I feel that this one fell way short.  The single player is entertaining as usual, but the multiplayer, which is why most people get the game is a step in the wrong direction.  The multiplayer maps are very unimaginative, just a bunch of buildings with little creativity compared to other COD titles.  Weapons are basically the same but with more options.  The gameplay is the worst yet.  I have a 35MBPs connection with a 35ms ping to the closest major city yet each game I play is laggy as heck and many games I get booted due to server connectivity.  You would think that they would have servers all over to accomidate all the users across the US!  I still think due to poor online gameplay and lack of map creativity this is near the bottom of COD titles."
1,Required to be logged onto EA servers to play,Call me silly but when I buy a single player game I expect to be able to actually play it after I install it.  I got an error message informing me that the server is full. If this is truly the way the video game industry is heading I need to find a new hobby or stick to playing MMO's where server issues are an expected and understandable problem.
5,Works as advertised,I had my doubts about this lens cleaner as all it is is a CD with one small spot of hairs on the surface. I put it in and it took all of 30 seconds to finish cleaning. I thought that was way to easy. But it sure worked as we haven't had an issue playing movies since. It also tests your surround sound which I thought was a cool touch.
1,Its pretty and great if you don't have a significant other ...,Its pretty and great if you don't have a significant other or people who come over to play a series youve done split screen on since the beginning. Way to lose a fan..
1,twice the price,to exspensive.
5,Everything a controller should be,"I like that the buttons protrude more than other controllers and the joysticks have an incredibly natural feel to them. Keep in mind, the buttons are not blank like represented in the product images, but the generic markings did nothing to hamper my experience. Strangely, the thumb grips are a different shade of blue than the controller, but they're definitely a nice bonus. This controller connects quickly and has a strong battery life. Solid buy."
1,DONT BUY,"This game made me a miscreant. Now I run around to various schools shooting them up. Before this game, I had no idea guns killed people."
2,Dont waste your money. buy a PS5,"i have both this and a ps5, and as soon as i turned this on i realised that the HUD looked exactly the same as the xbox one HUD. i got mad because i spent a buncha money for the same exact console with a different design. i love my ps5 so much because it feels new and refreshing, and also i can play quality games on it, and it feels very next gen. i say this console is ok, but if you have a pc or an xbox one, dont waste your money. its nothing new. buy a ps5."
1,Stay Away from the Blue Pack,"I ordered the blue pack despite reading the bad reviews ... big mistake. They do not hold the charge, as soon as you unplug it from the charge wire, the controller shuts off.....DO NOT BUY!"
5,Perfect Fit,The case was great and it fits perfectly.
5,My 10 yo dino-lego-lovin' son thinks that it is AWESOME!,No problems at all.  My 10 yo dino-lego-lovin' son thinks that it is AWESOME!
1,Not as good as other racing games inc. other hot wheels wii,"We have had Hot Wheels Beat That by Activision Inc. for a couple of years now and have spent hundreds upon hundreds of hours playing it (I have two boys and I still love video games too).  So you should know I am comparing this game to that one.  Compared to Beat That this game is very boring.  The graphics are noticeably poorer quality and unimaginative.  In Beat That you feel like you are in there driving, with this one it feels cheap and uninspired.  The choices for races are limited as are the cars.  The control is more difficult than the many other racing games we own and there is no option for using the nunchuk for steering (which I feel offers greater control.  This game has been shelved after an hour of play and has sat there collecting dust.  In our opinion this was quickly thrown together (the cover is more exciting than the game).  Hope this helps!"
5,They're like the unicorns of the headset world.,"So comfortable. The mic is very flexible. Clean, on par sound. Not to mention you can replace the cushioning if and when it wears out. Mixamp is awesome, allows you to get that custom sound with the perfect voice to game ratio. Only problem I ran in to is sometimes when I get up, I forget that I'm wearing the super comfy bastards and walk away with them still on... and we all know what happens then. I'm not proud of it, but it is what it is. If you're looking for a good set of headphones, save up the extra money and grab a pair of these. You won't be disappointed."
5,Great Buy,Bought this for my great nephew as part of his birthday gift. He absolutely loves it. Is in great condition for being used.  Very Happy...
2,Worn After a Month of Use,"I was originally excited about this and gave it 5 stars, but the carbon fiber graphic is already worn off the left side after only a little over a month of use."
5,Nintendo Switch AC replacement charger,Great value for a Nintendo replacement AC charger!!! Works as advertised and has so far held up from abuse by a 12 and 9yr old. They take it everywhere we go and has charged the switch without fail every since purchase. This was the best priced charger on Amazon at time of purchase.
5,Great product,"Holds everything i need for my 3DS.  In other reviews i read that it didn't hold a New 3DS (with a Hori case on)  in the case sleeve, i posted a picture showing that it will hold one.  Holds 8 games but i manage 12 by using a 4 card holder and stocking it in the zippered spot.  I love my new case"
5,The Perfect Mouse,"When most people think of Corsair mice, the first mouse that springs to mind is not the Sabre RGB.  Surprisingly, in my opinion this midrange mouse from the Corsair lineup is actually their strongest offering.  The sensor on this mouse is amazing.  It tracks super well and has a wide range of possible DPIs.  I usually leave it set to 4000.  All of the buttons are tactile and clicky.  In terms of RGB implementation, this is where the mouse shines.  Every single LED on this mouse is fully controllable and the mouse body itself is color-neutral (I'm looking at you Glaive RGB and M65 RGB).  The LEDs on the mousewheel in particular look much better than those of the M65.  Additionally, the mouse glides super smoothly on my mousepad which is the MM800 Polaris RGB hard pad.  The cable on this mouse is also much longer than most people will need.  Overall, this mouse is a super solid offering whose relatively budget friendly price will not disappoint in terms of its super strong feature set."
1,DO NOT BUY,"Before you throw your hard earned cash down the toilet, be warned, this game which focuses strictly on multiplayer can't even be played split screen. I've been a gamer for years and could not get split screen mode to work... Well duh.. It's not supported. Gone are the days of playing with your family. I got this so I could play with my son and daughter. Oh wait... I have this so they can stare at the screen in disappointment as the other plays. I will be requesting a refund but who knows where that will get me. I watched video reviews before the game came out and it was listed on the website as split screen but hey, that's only for the Xbox One. Sorry EA and Popcap, you just lost a loyal fan. I've been playing your games on the pc browser for years and this is how you create a multiplayer game. This is pathetic. Oh, and I instantly called my brother who I convinced to buy the game and told him to return it. His was going to be a Birthday present so it's still unopened. I'll be telling everyone I know what crap this shoddy game is."
5,Works great!,These worked absolutely easy and perfectly. Way better than sitting close with the cords! Well worth the price!
5,Met expectations,Arrived quickly and as advertised
1,Switch arrived bricked,Got the switch and at first it would not connect to WiFi at all. Then it got stuck in a boot loop with the error code 2113-0218. I paid up for this switch for the faster shipping time and now I have to send it in for repairs for a month.
1,The few bad reviews were RIGHT for me!,"I ordered this a few days ago, saw the great reviews and assumed it was a good product. I also checked the few bad reviews, which described how the controller constantly pulled to the left even when the buttons were untouched. Those reviews were so few I thought it was just a random occurrence. Sure enough, opened mine last night, and oddly had lots of trouble syncing. It finally synced after about ten minutes of trying, and then the controller began pulling down in a neutral state. I tried to start a game but could barely get up off the lower menu bar at the home screen because it kept pulling down. Absolutely a waste of money, returning today, and looking for something else. Take this warning that I should have!"
5,Amazing keyboard!,"Perfect size for what i want, something portable and easy to handle to play on my Series X. It is plug and play, no issues at all, now i feel more confortable playing online shooters on my Xbox. The material quality and the sensitivity it's great, a little clicky than mechanical and soft as membrane, mouse precision is also good. It has internal battery and can be charge via USB-C. Very recommended, i got mine for less than Fourty. It is a steal for the quality and all that includes."
4,When i received the device it was in a nice black box with the company logo and their motto,When i received the device it was in a nice black box with the company logo and their motto. The mouse functioned righrt away and the dpi buttons worked as expected. Unfortunately the software did not come included with the product and I could not find it on the website. I noticed in other reviews people mentioned this. I simply contacted the customer support person via facebook and amazon and he answered me in a timely fashion and gave me the latest version of the english software. The software works great and I have not issues. This is a good mouse and works great. It would be even better if the software came with it or it was provided on the site page or better yet the manufacturers international website.
1,Thank God for Demos,"The Mac version of the game is seriously flawed.  I was happy to see the addition but when I tried the demo it was worse than what people had described.  Seriously, I am now done with this franchise and am sad to see that EA has let this slide so badly.  No customer service.  No interest in a product well done."
5,All Stars,"My wife and I are super Mario Cart Fans. We've bought at least 7 or 8 other race games but none hold a candle to Mario Carts. Will now we have one that does. Sonic Sega All-Stars is a ton of fun. It's a big game with lots to do. 24 colorful, detailed tracks that will keep you at the edge of your seat. Lots of power ups that are unique to the game. You can also use your Wii person that you may have made to drive the car. It makes me look fat. If you like Mario Carts, I don't see any way you would be sorry for purchasing this game. I bought mine from Amazon (free shipping) and had it in three or four days."
5,Best Final Fantasy game in a very long time,"This is the best Final Fantasy game I have played since FFX. The gameplay is extremely fun and engaging and CHALLENGING. So many characters to choose from, and the story is great. Only downside is that the graphics are not so great, but this is a PSP game after all. If you enjoyed games like crisis core then this is recommended."
2,Quality is most important,"My copy got a box cutter cut across the game case this is not acceptable, damaging the case you are selling."
1,WHY IS IT SO EXPENSIVE,THIS IS NOT FAIR
5,Beautiful game,Really cool and immersive game with many colors and will certainly pop when played on oled switch
5,Must Buy!,"At first I was kinda skeptical about buying this game because I had never played the first batman game. After finishing the story and most of the side missions I can officially say that this game deserved to be called game of the year. Its controls are a bit confusing at first, but once you get used to them the gameplay only gets better. If your on the fence about this game buy it!"
5,"Tons of fun building and playing, even as an adult!","I'm a 25 year old male, and I will admit I just bought it for myself.  It was incredibly fun to build everything, and some of the games have some good replay-ability.  The piano is a blast to return to, the motorbike is really fun, and the fishing is nice and relaxing.  There's quite a bit here.  I definitely recommend getting the variety kit for sure,"
5,A bit of joy to a couple of Gen X-ers,"My girlfriend and I are both in our 40's, and neither of us have owned any modern (post 2000) game console. For me it was a Super Nintendo, for her an N64. I borrowed a Nintendo Wii from a friend and loved it, but I never bought one. We just wanted something handheld that you can play the old school games on. I've had my eye on a Switch Lite for a while, and finally purchased one a couple of weeks ago. I don't know the technical ins and outs of modern consoles, so I'm just going to keep my mouth shut there; but after an easy setup, this has been a ton of fun for both of us. I would like to ease my way into newer games, I just became uninterested in video games from my teenage years to recently, so nearly 30 years in this particular realm of technology has largely passed me by. But like I said, my girlfriend and I have been having a lot of fun reliving the 80's and early 90's with this. So if you're looking for the same experience, definitely pick one of these up."
5,These are good,Okay so... for a 20 dollar headset these are decent and will get you by... I've been using them for a couple weeks now for gaming and skyping. First off they are aesthetically pleasing.
5,Simply Perfect,"If you play Karaoke Revolution or American Idol video games, then this mic is for you! You can say goodbye to all the problems with the headset, especially when more than a couple people are playing. You can just pass the mic instead waiting until every player gets adjusted using the headset mic. Plus, it fits everyone! Some players fit the headset perfectly but the ones who don't suffer. They get the mic right but not the earpiece, or the earpiece right and not the mic. It registers your voice accuately. This handheld is perfect!"
1,Misleading title,"I want my money back, i thought i was suppose to play as a princess. BUT NO! i was some elf guy in a dress. wtf?"
5,I loved it,"Im gonna have to disagree with the previous reviews. I loved this game in its entirety. Considering how shallow the original one was and I still loved that one this was huge. Amazing graphics and fun gameplay. I dont think lack of blood is a reason to dislike a game, considering the blood in the dinos is plentiful. If you enjoyed the original at all this one will be amazing. A lot more options and much better dinosaur fighting action."
1,do not waste your money !,"The code does not work, this was a waste of money and more importantly this was suppose to be a gift for my son as a reward for doing good in school and on assignments. SELL SHOULD BE UP FRONT! I HAVE NEVER HAD A ISSUE WITH SHOPPING ON AMAZON BUT ALLOWING PRODUCTS TO BE SOLD SO SHADY LIKE THIS WILL DEFINITELY WEIGH IN ON MY ONLINE SHOPPING WITH AMAZON IN THE FUTURE."
5,"I own one accidentally bought two, love it .","Too many options for my adha, but it's awesome. Worth having"
5,Awesome game,"A classic graphic adventure in the model of Myst, but with better, more animated scenery and other characters to interact with. Five CDs worth, too, a HUGE game! Very challenging, but not absurdly so. Interesting and engaging story line that doesn't get lost. Well worth the price for gaming enthusiasts, a real lost gem."
1,I was hoping for some fun battles on the big screen,No split screen multiplayer. I was hoping for some fun battles on the big screen. I wouldn't have bought it if I had known.
1,The r2 trigger sticks within one month!,I have 2 controllers and within 2 weeks the first controller's r2 trigger started sticking. At first I thought I had gotten a lemon but I was wrong. 2 weeks after that one broke my other controllers r2 trigger started sticking and the rubber is starting to come off on the analog sticks. It is impossible for me to play any shooting game because the gun shoots nonstop. If you look it up this a major problem with the controller and not a isolated incident
1,Scalpers go away,Scalpers no scalping!
5,"Regarding the ""censorship""","One single scene is being edited in the US version of the game. That's -edited-, not cut entirely. The edit in question was handled by the original developers themselves, surely to prevent angering American soccer moms, not to protect anyone playing the game. After all, there was nothing to protect anyone from. Every other aspect of the Japanese game will remain intact. Please disregard the reviewer who made it sound as if the game was going to be butchered in the localization process."
2,Compilations aren't what they used to be,I am tired of these empty compilations. I remember when Taito had 2 compilation discs back on the PS2. Those were LOADED with games! Now companies put out these empty collections at maximum price. Stay away unless you really like any of the games in this collection.
5,This is lovely for an affordable board.,"I will note, that you need to be very careful when pulling the keycaps, as the switch pulled right our with it. So, hotswap keyboard it is! I bought this primarily for gaming and trying for switch testing. i'm pretty surprised with how much I like typing on it. The sounds are not very high pitched, which I love. Be aware, the stabilizers are... pingy? I think they will get pulled out and either replaced or at least lubed... or something. The space-bar isn't super pingy, but the enter and backspace are. I pretty much expect that on any new pre-built board, so it doesn't detract from the overall feel of the board. Shipping does take a while, but 2 weeks isn't terrible."
5,Just buy it already,"Is it like Oblivion? Yes, but better. I've been able to see how the graphics compare to PS3 and Xbox360 , and unsurprisingly, PC is much better. The voice acting is excellent, and there are a lot more unique voices in this iteration, not nearly as many repeat voices like in Oblivion. I have done very little in the main story, but have been playing since just after launch and haven't had a lack of things to do, if anything there's almost too much. Well worth a play."
5,Great Buy,Very sturdy and does exactly what it says. Would definitely recommend to others.
1,Arrived damaged,"Preordered early. Arrived damaged, can't even get replacement since its sold out. Even the products inside it are dinged. Heartbroken."
1,Two controllers defective out of box,'A' button on two controllers fail to activate depending on where you press the button. Controller is smaller and rubber grip is slippery from the start causing hand cramps. Thumbsticks have bad deadzone even on the most aggressive profile setting. Bad controller all around.
2,Overrated FPS,"I thought this was going to be something extraordinary by all the hype by xbox fanboys so i gave it a shot. It's nowhere near the holy grail game that many fanboys would have you believe. It's just another FPS that is COD with robots and gets dull after an hour or 2, not worth 60 bucks at all."
4,My husband and kids love this game,My husband and kids love this game! So many to choose from and lots of old ones my husband played when he was a kid. It's wonderful!
5,"If you play Genshin Impact, you NEED this!",I have only had this product a few days and so far I am very happy with it. It makes playing certain games much easier! I am considering getting another one for a friend!
4,AWSOME!,"but you should Fortnite downloaded or it won't work. it comes with the Joker outfit (2 additional styles), laughing riot back bling (reactive), bad joke pickaxe, the Joker's revenge pickaxe, pick a card contrail, Poison Ivy outfit (with 1 additional style), back bloom back bling, ivy axe pickaxe, Midas Rex outfit (with 1 additional style), Midas crest back bling, kingmaker pickaxe, and 1,000 V-bucks."
4,Probably a 7 out of 10,"Essentially (and not surprisingly), this is Silent Hill: Homecoming.  Controls are the same, graphics are the same, combat is the same.  It's the same game, except for a Saw-twist on things.  The puzzles seem to be a little easier.  My advice is to download the demo of Silent Hill: Homecoming (if there is one) and see if you like it.  If you do, you'll like Saw: The Video Game.  It's not a game you'll show off to your friends, but it's one you can take turns with friends and play through in one night because it's engaging, like the Saw movies are.  In fact, it's really hard to put down.  I kept telling myself I'd quit after one more puzzle, but I kept playing it until it was over.  Short, but a fun game.  Ideally, a good, fun rental.  If fun's the whole purpose of a game, then this is a winner."
4,"Breath taking game, the only thing keeping this game ...","Breath taking game, the only thing keeping this game from being the 5 star game it can be is the multi-player co-op missions are hard to set up. It won't let you play with a friend until you start a quest, watch all cutscenes, then quit out the quest to start it over again. This could be fixed."
1,Wrong size.,"The original pro controller joystick is on the right. The slight size difference in depth, diameter, and mounting are enough to make this product not work. I'm replacing on a Zelda edition switch pro controller."
5,Brand new works new,Good brand new
1,I guess im unlucky...,"Doesnt work, getting a replacement sent.  darn.  But everything besides that im happy about.  The box was really cool looking."
1,Screwed Over,"The guitar came in with no white facing on the front and no back panel to cover where the Wii remote goes. Worst of all , all of the wires were cut in the cable that plugs into the Wii remote. Totally screwed over"
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,"Buttons died within 4 days. Control stick started floating at the same time! I contacted there company support sent all the information they requested from my order to get a replacement and havent heard back from them, it's been a week. AVOID THIS CONTROLLER AND ALL OF THERE PRODUCTS!!!!"
5,Amazing. Simply amazing.,"Where do I begin?! First, shipping was quick and easy. Got my order in perfect condition. Secondly, the stickers are easy to put on due to the grooved adhesive on the sticky side so pushing air bubbles out is SO EASY. Third, the print and the stickers are great material. They feel expensive. Finally, the overall feel my switch has now makes me even more excited for the game to be released!! Thanks for reading this review and I hope you enjoy all of the fun times in AC NH when it launches!"
5,One of my kids' favorite games,"Both of my daughters, ages 8 and 9, say this game is ""awesome"".  They say to get the baby to grasp your finger, you just press down on the baby's finger with the stylus, and keep pressing down until a star shows up.  I recommend this for girls who are growing out of the doll phase but are still interested in playing ""Mommy."""
5,Ds caring  case,For the kids Nintendo  ds .Love it
2,Not my cup of software.,"This may be a good program if you grew up with it but after coming from Microsoft flight sim 2004,flightsim x and DCS this program is really not user friendly to get into and fly. Many of the aircraft are not complete and do not handle in a realistic way. I am not a pilot but I have flown ultralights and have flown in many other types of aircraft before and this software is not realistic. The scenery is great to look at in some areas but that does little when the planes do not function properly.  How can the instruments controls be so different between the two sim makers and xplanes way of adjusting them to me is just, well, maybe I shouldn't say it here. The graphics in both of Microsoft's flight Sims are maybe not as good as xplane in appearance but they work well and I have a 64 bit computer with a great graphics card and an older Processor. I can max graphics in Flightsim x but not x plane without glitches. X plane makers talk about how great their graphics are and they do look more realistic than flightsim x but in my area there are large lakes, Summit and Paxson that don't even show up as lakes, that isn't very realistic in my book. With all the frustration I am having with this program just trying to figure it out and I haven't even got into the atc part of it yet I would not have bought it. I cannot understand why anyone would want to write a software this complicated to figure out and use and try to sell it to the public. When I want to fly I want a Sim that is realistic and easy to learn and use not one that you had to be bottle fed on to figure out. Microsoft's programs may not be supported anymore but at least you can use them and enjoy them and figure them out without trying to obtain a software degree while doing it and their planes that come with the software are complete planes with many others to download for free. Some of the x plane models are not complete and do not have functioning gauges and switches. I can't speak for others but I have tried it and I don't like it and I can't recommend it to anyone, especially a newbie to flight Sims. I still say that Flight Sim 2004 is probably the best one built, it works and works well. I do not work for Microsoft I just like software that works, that's my opinion and review, nothing more. Hope it helps you in your decision as to wither to buy it or not."
1,DLC isn't on disc. Bought this for the code ...,DLC isn't on disc. Bought this for the code and the code had already been redeemed. Returning. Don't even buy this.
5,Perfect for your daughter,"My daughter and her friends all have a Nintendo DS.  But there are very few games that are for girls.  Sure, there are a few, but she often ends up just playing her brothers' games.  She was so excited when she saw the TV ad for Imagine Fashion Designer, so I bought it for her back in November.  She loved it.  So she asked for the Animal Doctor game, and I bought it for Christmas.  Another winner.  I don't know all the ins and outs of the games, but I have watched her play and they have surprising depth.  And most importantly, they are safe.  Safe, fun. and made for HER - not her brothers.  Happy imagining :)"
5,Far Cry 4 - PC,"Far Cry 4 - PC  I had some problems with it because I'm have one hand, but for the most part with one hand I can get through it."
5,Awsome Game,"I played this game for about 7 hours straight, and never got sick of it. Even my friend who doesn't like games really enjoyed it and kept playing it."
4,shoot a blupee,"This is a fun and addictive game.  My girlfriend is fed up but, I know how to kill walking guardians now, so yeah."
4,Romance with a bit of culture,"I liked this movie because it gave a ""bird's-eye"" view of culture. Few fiction writers give insight into the culture and delves into relationships of the Orthodox Jewish faith, except for the movie ""A Stranger Among Us"" and Faye Kellerman's fictional characters, Rina Lazurus and Peter Decker. It is rare that storylines deal with the culture (woman with shaved hair, ""sheitel"" headcovering) This movie mildly mentions a few areas which aroused curiosity as to the reason behind some of the customs. The movie is refreshing, not long, but has a balanced amount of romance and thought-provoking concepts and culture that makes it pleasantly worthwhile viewing.  It is a well-done Hallmark movie."
5,This is a japanese version!,Don't leave negative reviews on this product because it is not in English. It says JAPANESE VERSION!!!!
5,For the person who has everything!,"Bought this for a friend's birthday. We're doing a ""Spam"" themed party because she LOVES Spam! This ""Spam"" cookbook comes beautifully spiral bound with lovely colored recipe pictures and easy to follow directions. Seller was quick to ship and had adequate packing material to protect the cookbook inside the box. The shipping charge seemed a little excessive, but everything now days costs more so can't really fault them for passing it on to the consumer."
5,Five Stars,Great headset. Used with PS4. Also bought an extension cord for it.
5,Great quality braided cables,From the braided cords to the metal on the connectors everything seems to be made out of quality materials. The 10 feet length of the cable just makes it that much easier to charge the PS4 controller while using it. Can also be used for any micro-usb application. Definite recommendation!
5,Great First Impression,"Given that most reviews out today are going to be simply 'impressions' - I'll through my words out there as well.  This game so far is amazing.  I'm loving the overall controls and feel.  Having played the first two as they released, I was pleased to find some muscle memory still exists for inFAMOUS.  I'm in agreement with most - the graphics on this game are insane! I think if it were a launch title, we would be even more impressed (as I was when I first popped in Killzone) - but having somewhat acclimated to the PS4 graphics, its doesn't jolt me as much - but still, the best graphics I've seen thus far."
1,TRASH do not buy this.,Garbage I payed the same amount of money as a normal Xbox controller and the audio jack does not work and it came in a beat up box
2,Bore me...,"Basically, this game is BORING, and it just lacked creativity from the developers. It's monkey see monkey do, no freestyle mode or anything truely interesting. You don't use your mii or any other character for that matter, so there is no personalization. They also did not offer much a tutorial, and though they have this icon to preview the upcoming move, it didn't mean much to me. Maybe in a party setting this game would be okay, but even then I don't think that it will be a hit. I would pass, especially since it is well overpriced for what you'll get, and buy Boogie Superstar. The moves are harder, but at least I had fun screwing them up. I gave this game 3 stars for fun, because at least you're up moving an the music is okay."
2,Requires day 1 patch,Very disappointing that they botched the physical release like this with a somewhat large day 1 patch. You'd think it would be reasonable to expect the physical copy to actually function as a physical copy instead of a glorified digital key but NISA messed it up as usual.
5,Way better than COD,"I am a full blown Call of Duty guy but after all these futuristic garbage COD franchises has went to, I started on the look for an old school COD type with boots on the ground, no fancy-dancy stuff and Battlefield 1 fits that mold perfectly.  The squad commands and the huge wars this game have (30 versus 30!) is incredible.  I may have officially tossed all Call of Duty loyalty out the window and will march on with the Battlefield franchise!"
5,Great Birthday gift,I bought this for my grandson who loved it!
5,Works,Works great! Love it
5,System start up sounds like shields recharging!,"System is worth the money.  Like I already mentioned, when you start up the xbox, it sounds like your shields recharging and when you power down, the same.  The disc drive has cool non button button that open and closes it.  The two controllers are very sharp and seem a bit heavier, better quality than standard wireless controllers.  This package includes two of them which is nice.  There are going to be a million reviews on halo reach, so I am just going to comment on the system package, which I personally am very happy with."
5,Long shot mode was fun.,Game is about the same as ever year just with minor detail upgrades. Long shot mode was fun.
4,Great for Xbox 360 just OK for PC...,"This a great wheel for the Xbox 360. It also works for the PC if you have a wireless receiver for the PC. Force Feedback doesn't work if you're running off of batteries. Force Feedback doesn't work for the PC, rumble works and the wheel gives you resistance but the true Force feedback effect only works on the Xbox. I can see hardcore sim fans missing it, it basically means that if you hit a curb while racing on the PC you'll feel the wheel rumble... on the the Xbox you'll feel the wheel rumble and the wheel pulls as if you've hit a real curb. There's also some pull on the tires as you're taking corners, it's a nice feature, but the additional force the wheel gives on the PC also helps out with you're driving without true FFB."
5,A Refreshing Change,"I absolutely love this game. It has all the loved basics of the Pokemon series and so much more. I have to say after Platinum, Heart Gold, and Soul Silver the games were getting a little stale. Sure, they were excellent remakes, but that's the key word, ""Remakes"". Pokemon White and Black were a sight for sore eyes. A completely new game with all new Pokemon. Very, VERY refreshing! It feels like I'm taking my first steps in Red and Blue all over again! It's nice to start fresh with a new team, not going into every cave and seeing the repetitive Geodude and Zubat. I actually feel excited every time I enter a new area, not knowing what new Pokemon might pop out at me. These games are also a lot more serious. The Pokemon are sharper and look tougher, and the bad guys aren't just evil for the sake of being evil. They have motives and are actually trying to do good. They have also greatly improved the online capabilities of the games also. Video chat included! I recommend this to any longtime Pokemon fans, or people who are new to the series. It is a wonderful change in pace and a great addition to a DS collection!"
5,cable,brother needed it
1,False Advertising. Nintendo hits new low.,Single player!! Are you kidding me? It says two player is possible but it doesn't even use the remotes we have for our WiiU. I'm done with Nintendo.  Time for the kids to get an XBox. I'm sure they'll be crushed ;)
5,Nice Case,I just received this case for my daughter's New Nintendo 3DS XL and it fits just right. It's not as bulky like I thought it would be. The charger fits in one compartment and the games in another with the stylus. The 3DS XL slides right into the back pocket sleeve withought any trouble. It also comes with two zipper pulls. I would definitely recommend this especially for travel.
5,Works as advertised,Works as advertised
5,awesome game so far,the package arrived safely and the game was in the case sealed tightly. brand new. this game will be awesome playing it with my pro controller. the seller was digitalville LLC. they got our product on time.
5,I have the genesis 3 system...wish I had this one!,"With video game technology changing all the time and new systems and games always coming out I still play this one. Honestly, when the genesis first came out I wasn't all that interested but over time I took a liking to it. The games are amazing! To name just a few...Sonic 1,2,and 3, Earthworm Jim 1 and 2 and the excellent Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter series. Great graphics and great gameplay make these even more fun. If you don't have a genesis get one if you can! I hope... will get this model genesis back in stock someday. I have the genesis 3 model which works fine but does not support any of the genesis add-ons such as the 32x or the sega cd."
1,Doesn't work on my DVD players,"None of my three DVD players (Sony, Magnavox, Proscan) will read the lens-cleaner disk.  When I try to play it, I get either a ""can't read"" message (Sony) or a strange sound as if the player is trying, but unsuccessfully, to play the disk. I tried to run a replacement disk. Same result.  A DVD player at Wal-Mart, where I had purchased the disk, played the disk without difficulty. Three different employees professed mystification at the inability of my DVD players to read the disk.  Since the box containing the disk has no Maxell telephone number on it, I can't (as I would like) call Maxell to get their take on the problem. I feel ripped off."
5,Great simple case.,"Bought this case to take my DS on the go. Case is hard and nice to the touch. Inside is very spacious fits 8 games I currently only have 3 with 1 in the DS and an SD card. SD card fits nicely in the game slots. I bought a USB charger for the DS and an Anker 5,000 mAh external charger that fits perfectly in the zip up portion of the case inside. Love this case very much can't go wrong with it :)"
5,Game I'll Remember for a Lifetime,"I grew up on King's Quest. My parents were playing King's Quest I when I was in the womb, and every time a new King's Quest came out they would play it. When I was very little, it was exciting to watch them play the games. As I got older, I would be very eager to help them solve some of the puzzles. By the time King's Quest VII came out, I could practically play on my own and it was such an amazing experience to explore the lands, meet characters, and solve problems with all of the items in your inventory. I learned a lot about mythology and fairy tale lore. I played through this game multiple times. Fifteen years later, I STILL think about this game. Somewhat often. I remember with nostalgia my favorite levels, favorite characters, favorite scenes. This game was so clever and contained a lot of humor. The graphics were bright and fun. I will always think back fondly on this game."
1,Broken item,I received an item which doesn't work. I contacted buyer through Amazon and have yet to hear back from them. It was a gift for Christmas for my son and I paid and got nothing. I will be disputing this through amazon and my credit card for a full refund!!!!!!
5,Missing husband,"Help, I haven't had a conversation with my husband since the purchase of this. Our daughter wants his attention. At least it's something that I bought him that he uses for once."
5,Perfect for gaming.,10 year old gives thumbs up.
4,great for storage,"everything except the steering wheels fit, other than that I love it"
4,Hits the 6 to 12 age group nicely,"This is a good choice for a child in 2nd to sixth grade. I think it's actually a bit more suited to girls that game because there is a lot of focus on social interaction that boys might become impatient with. The game is text based and a bit old school in it's layout - this is a hunt and find type of game where Pikachu will be running from one end of PokePark to another looking for pokemon to befriend or battle. The skill level depends on what the player wants from the game. My younger daughter is happy to run through the storyline, my older one wants to collect every single pokemon methodically. Price is a bit high, I think. I wish Nintendo had brought this out at their second price point instead of their established one for longer playing games. That aside, it's been a huge hit in our house since release day. This won't challenge the adult player long, but a child with a bit of patience and a passion for pokemon will love it."
5,Nice hard to find small size LED keyboard.,"This LED keyboard is working out well as I needed a small footprint keyboard.  Finding an LED keyboard for my small side desk was a challenge because it is a small computer desk and the pull out tray requires a small keyboard.  The lighted keys are easy to see and the three color options is a plus.  The only issue I have typing is the main enter key is a bit smaller and different shape than my old keyboard which causing me to miss it at times.  So why the 5 star rating if it is not perfect?  Well, for me it is because for the money my expectations were lower and met and most important for me my small size needs were spot on.  So it was a good value all around."
2,Buy the Bundle,"I made the mistake of buying just the game and drums since I have 2 GH3 guitars and 2 mics (from Boogie and Idol).  You need to have everything Rock Band specific to get it to work correctly.  Don't make the same mistake that I did!  The game is fun to play, but you'll end up spending a lot more money!"
4,Great way to keep everything organized,Cool charger that neatly stores all of your switch gear
5,..,Amazing.
5,This is my favorite RPG of all time,"I've been an avid gamer since I was a very small child (4 to be exact when I first got my hands on an NES in 1988) and RPG's have been my genre since then. I have played and beaten countless RPG's on all different kinds of consoles since then... excluding all those I have played on PC and Mac, and for some reason even among world reowned classics such as FFVII and Chrono Trigger this game has stood profoundly out in my mind. Filled with compelling and mentally stimulating gameplay, if you're a true RPG fan, this is not a title you will soon forget. However, if old-skool RPG gaming to you is the that time last year when you beat FFVIII... forget it."
5,Good,Fits perfectly.
1,Absolutely Amazing,"This game is so awesome. The Player customization is crazy good and very deep and detailed. I like to have the ability to choose from 3 or 4 faces...cool! The career mode is really deep and the commentary hardly ever repeats itself! I love when my guy does the sprinkler after he knocks in that 2 foot par...sweet! The ranked matches run flawlessly, although I have been dropped to the dash maybe 100 times. I like that you can't play the masters, makes Grand Slamming a lot easier. It's also nice to be able to tie for majors without the game having a playoff hole. I enjoy that they don't acknowledge a tie at any point in any game mode...I could lose on the next hole so I think it's cool just to win without acknowledging that someone else has the same score as me. I can't wait until my created golfer reaches level 100 then I bet the game gets wayyyyy better, I'm sure a ton more features will pop up after I finish my career. I like that there is around 8 professional golfers you can use, oh, and the 8 courses that the game has is more than enough. On Tiger Woods there was a feature where you could create your team and play with your friends, I'm glad they did away with that because playing with the same people can get repetitive. I think EA out did themselves with this game, this will be the bar at which golf games are made going forward. If Rory McIlroy is playing this during his off time I bet he's having a ton of fun! I love this game"
5,I was so happy we found something that works,"Yay my xb360 works again! We got this after our original power brick kept over heating. I was so happy we found something that works, was reasonably priced and came really quickly! Our system is on pretty much all afternoon and evening since we use it to watch tv as well as for gaming and so far there have been no issues. I would definitely recommend this product!"
5,xbox one pawns ps4 by 100 to 1,"I love the controller,quiet bluray drive and over all kinect is a beast.dead rising 3 is so much fun i highly recommend it . This console does not give red lights or DOA stuff it just works unlike the ps4 so imho this is next gen specially u can stream movies and music also play divx movies too. Mp3 support in the next few update we will see external drive support something the ps4 will never ever see , so go buy one now."
5,Great Product!!,Clone version of the 360 controller. Only thing missing is the X in the center of the power button. Feels great and buttons are very responsive. Deffinitly would buy again!
4,Surprisingly good,"With Justice League Heroes hitting the home consoles, this GBA game got churned out as well, which takes the focus away from Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, and Green Lantern, and instead focuses on the fastest man alive, the Flash.  And guess what?  It's surprisingly good superhero fun.  Yeah, it looks like the standard Final Fight style beat 'em up, but the Flash's super speed is used so good here that it sets the game apart from the pack.  You can use a quick burst of speed to knock around your enemies, or you can slow down time and move ultra fast so your foes don't stand a chance, and in heavy situations, you can call for help from Superman, Wonder Woman, and Martian Manhunter.  The graphics are solid enough, using small character sprites that look good, and voice effects for the characters that work well too.  The bosses include such Flash rogue favorites like Gorilla Grood and Professor Zoom as you trek through Keystone City, Gotham City, and more to take on Brainiac, which shouldn't take you too long because sadly the game is a little on the short side.  Not to mention that some other Flash rogues would have been welcome, like fan favorites like Captain Cold, Captain Boomerang, Trickster, or Mirror Master; which would have fit better here than Killer Frost.  Despite that though, Justice League Heroes: The Flash is a surprisingly good superhero beat 'em up that nicely captures the spirit of the Flash, and it's definitely worth checking out for Flash fans."
5,"overall, would recommend","so far they seem to be holding a good charge, the charging cords could be longer, maybe 8' instead of 5'. You get a lot for the price, seems like money well spent"
1,She loved playing the role of tank or damage,"I played this game 2 years ago at Blizzcon with my daughter.  She loved playing the role of tank or damage, while I healed her with my character.  The way the game is designed, it really is exciting for people to support one another, really make it a team effort.  We had so much fun and we could not wait until it came out.  Until I found out there is no way for my daughter and I to play together.  At Blizzcon we were able to play on the same team.  But unless I have 2 PCs, 2 Xbox ones, or 2 playstation 4s, we can't play together.  Blizzard has said no to even crossing platforms.  We have a pc and an Xbox One so if they green-lighted this we would be thrilled.  But they won't.  Why make a game that is so much fun to play together as a family and make it one player?  So ridiculous.  They are just catering to hard-core gamers.  And hard-core gamers probably will not like the game from what I hear, the only people overly impressed are people like me, casual gamers, who want to play with their family in the same room.  I have no idea what Blizzard was thinking on this one....."
1,Stay Away!,"Being an ardent RH fan, I was curious how this would be done. The old RH game (on my C-64 years ago) was interesting for it's time. This game has graphics that aren't much better than in that version from 1985. The only real difference is the inserted 3 second video clips, having Richard O'Brien say inane things like 'How did that happen?'. The music (except for the 3 added CD tracks), and characters, are horrendous and very unlike the movie. As a game, definitely worthless, even as a fan.  As nostalgia, worth only showing that you own another piece of the RH history."
1,Maybe I'll try again after bugs worked out,Auto sensing hdmi feature doesn't work properly causing sound with no picture. Returning for refund for 400.00 should of been right out of the box.
5,Better than skull candy,So happy to have turtle beaches again.
4,Works great!!,"Recieved the product today and it works great. BUT I can tell the connector mechanism is 3rd party and has a death grip sometimes on the games but other than that, it works great."
1,"Wow, for shame Capcom :(","I had been excited for months leading up to the release, however I am very disappointed at the launch it's terrible. The online barely works and the single player is bare-bones I had hoped for more specially with the season pass as well. I regret buying this new and at launch."
5,Wii love it...,"Perfect, as of this date. Will keep you apprised."
5,In Response to XboxFan...,"Have you even played any other KOF game in the series? Honestly, if you have than you'd be able to play this game. They added many moves that actually make the game simpler to newcomers, and difficulty in perfoming special attacks is one thing that makes a game interesting. I do believe that you are not an abid fighting game player, and if you are, you are used to button mashing controls of Super Smash Bros, or titles of that sort. This game is for people who know KOF, from 94 to 04 and beyond. King of Fighters, is not Street Fighter, and if you play it like Street Fighter, your in for a world of hurt. Learn the game and then you'll appreciate it."
5,Five Stars,Nice looking dock shield. Wish they made the protective film easier to remove.
5,Better than the official.,"This fits the Switch better than the official pouch. It's roomier, you can keep earbuds in the mesh section, and it has groves to better accommodate the L and R buttons. The shell is rigid, unlike Nintendo's version."
1,Stay away,"Like the other reviews said, supposedly you can only play the game once. That would mean, you cannot loan it to a friend or sibling, nor can you resell it after you've played. I can ALMOST understand that restriction if the MSRP was half the price of a typical 3DS game, but this one is full price. Stay away from this one."
1,Terrible Software - Boring and Repetitive,"The Dora show is so creative, complex and entertaining that I was excited about the possibility of software! I bought this for my son when he was three and couldn't believe how disappointed we were. He lost interest very quickly. There were only about three activities to do and they were all similar and repetitive. For instance, when you complete a task like putting the Pirate Piggies in the right boats, you are rewarded by....getting to do it all over again! And then again! This was the first and only Nick software I've bought because I'm so afraid of getting burned again. My son loves the Freddi Fish and Putt-Putt software, which costs less anyway so that's what I'd recommend if you have preschoolers."
1,Unacceptably Buggy,"Physical quality of the keyboard is fine. But the main keys stop working at random intervals requiring a reboot. Alternately keys will stick, making you run out of control in games. It isn't just my keyboard either, there are plenty of complaints at the Logitech forums. Something is screwed up either in the software or the chips. I recommend waiting until the problems are sorted out."
5,Great Alternative to NES original equipment.,The batteries fit very well in the aftermarket controllers. They seem to hold a charge so far. If there are any changes in the charge life in the near future I will post it on this review.
5,Fantastic Low Profile Mechanical Keyboard,"I love the keys on this thing! They feel better than Cherry MX Brown by a huge margin. I also find the lower profile keys increase my speed and tactile feel. The keys have grooves that form to your finger tips. In case you were concerned the key tops were completely flat; they are not. With the legs up, the keyboard only has the slightest slant. Please see the attached picture. The color adjustments are a bit tacky, but some people enjoy that I guess.. I just set them to be solid and a low lighting level."
1,Beyblade trap,This game is a trap for beyblade-loving kids. Our 9-year old was very excited to get this game but he lost his interest quite soon. He did not want to admit this for a while and played it some time like 10 minutes. In the end he confessed that even the game on Battle Striker website was better.
1,Do NOT buy this game.,"I have been playing Battlefield and COD games since they were released.  I love playing both of them and think they both have their merits and drawbacks.  That said, this is the worst game to date.  The multiplayer is the WORST of all of them, just god awful.  I've installed the game to the hard drive and there is still MAJOR lag and it just looks crappy, let alone the gameplay.  I saw how this game had bad reviews on amazon and I still bought it thinking maybe they were just being cry-babies.  Instead I was wrong and have paid the literal price.  Maybe this game was designed for the Xbox One and they tried to push is on the 360 platform and thats why is sucks so bad but I never in my life have played a game this trashy."
1,"The game itself is great, but when you can't complete the install because ...","The process by which you have to download Bookworm after you buy it is almost impossible to complete.  The game itself is great, but when you can't complete the install because the game takes you to places you don't want to be, it is not worth the time or money."
1,Fake PS3 Controller,"Don't buy a PS3 controller from NorAm International Partners, Inc.  They are selling fake controllers.  You can tell it's fake if the buttons seem a little off, the home button and the LED lights at the top are a little recessed, and if you have difficulty syncing the controller to your PS3.  By difficulty, I mean that it takes 30 seconds or more to sync and flashes all four lights for this time.  Also, if your controller is plugged in when you shut your ps3 down, your controller will continue to blink and will actually restart your ps3, meaning you have you manually turn it off or unplug the controller.  Finally, the sticker on the back of the controller is missing most of the specs other controllers have on them.  Wish I would have read their feedback profile before I bought it, as this is not the first time someone noticed it was fake.  Don't buy from them, you'll regret it"
5,Incredible!!,"VA-11 Hall-A is one of my favorite games of all time, so I'm very pleased to finally own a physical copy of the game for a reasonable price. I'm also very please that the game was delivered in mint condition and also the hidden cover art hidden inside the case. One of the best purchases I've made this year."
1,"Fun game, until the grown ups ruined it.",It is shameful that adults hoard and sell these at exorbitant rates so that children cannot afford to finish the game.
4,It's entertaining,"This isn't a normal game. There's not much for you to do. It's kind of like a choose your own adventure type thing, but not really. I feel like the choices don't really matter. But the story is great. I often forgot I was playing a game because the story was like a movie."
4,Fun but not worth the re-sellers price.,"Flintstones II: Surprise at Dinosaur Peak is a game released near the end of the original NES life. It has good graphics for its day and is hard game that is still fun to play through. Word of advise - DO NOT PAY THE CRAZY PRICES THAT THIS GAME IS GOING FOR! Emulate it and enjoy it that way. It's not hurting the people who made this game or nintendo if you do so. It hurts the jerks that try to price gouge your nostalgia. If it comes on digital download on the WiiU or whatever nintendo system buy it that way, but emulate the crap out of it."
2,Buyer beware,Buyer beware!! May get some discs that are unreadable buy blu ray or 4K players. I spent extra and download digital copies.
5,Works with 4k Firestick,"I have the 4K Firestick with Kodi and Emulators. I did tons of research on controllers that would be compatible. I tried my PS4 and Xbox one and neither were able to map properly. So I took a long shot and bought this one. It paired and sworked perfectly! Smooth and no lag. It actually shows up as an ""Amazon controller"". So yes it worked for me on the latest update on the Firestick TV 4k."
5,Great Gift,"I had one of these and every time my teen granddaughters came over they played it constantly.  They live overseas so I wanted a Christmas gift that would pack easily for their return home a week after Christmas.  This set gave me a CD for each of them.  They had said many times that they also loved Pentatonix's ""Mary Did You Know.""  They squealed with excitement when they opened this gift.  SUCCESS!  Now I need to buy that one for MY Christmas collection!"
4,Good control,"Love the height, wish the grip felt different but makes aiming a lot easier."
5,quallity referb,worked great out of box all was included support if I need it too
5,"Civ still rocks, even on the small screen!","As a long time Civ player (all the way back to Civ I), I can say that this title is indeed the true Civ experience.  Everything you loved about the original seems to be here and it is greatly simplified.  It has to be simplified really as the DS system is not as capable as a full blown PC is.  The maps seem a tad small to me, meaning you bump into other civilizations faster than you might otherwise, but overall the look and feel of Civ is in there.  This will be great for people who love Civ4 and travel a lot, or simply just want to relax in the back yard and test their empire building skills.  Well done Sid Meier!"
5,one of the best on the NES,"Super Mario Bros 2 is my favorite game of the series and the original SMB is a legend.  So where does this leave Super Mario Bros 3?  This was the last Super Mario game on the old NES and while I might like some of the other games more, this might be the class of the series on the NES.  With the strange direction that SMB2 went, this was a trip back to the roots of Mario.  This is a true side scrolling game and features many of the same enemies from the original.  You still jump, stomp and throw fire to make your way through the game.  But there are new features now.  First, there is now a world map and you can select which level you want to enter next.  Some levels are avoidable, some are not, but you can also do special areas (several mini-games and an area where you get bonus items).  You are able to get items throughout the game, and you can use them before levels to be stronger.  There are also several different suits that augment your abilities.  The most common is the Racoon suit which allows you to kill the enemies by flicking your tail at them, and also giving you the ability to fly for short periods of time. There is also a frog suit (allowing swimming to be easier), a Tanooki suit (much like the raccoon suit, but you can briefly turn to stone to avoid enemies...rare), and I believe there is a Hammer Brothers Suit (but I could be wrong about this one....my memory is a little hazy).  This is one of the best games released for the NES and is essential gaming for a Mario fan."
1,I'm going back to my ps2 and play the original battlefront 2 when EA actually made a good game.,This game is not even worth the money you pay for the original price of the game especially when they expect you to spend more money to upgrade your players and ships. I'm going back to my ps2 and play the original battlefront 2 when EA actually made a good game.
5,Amazing!,The day one edition is amazing but I wish it was white and black in color. The white and black ones are even more gorgeous than the regular versions! The voice commands work really well but you have to learn them but I'll get the hang of it in coming days!
1,Buy a different bundle.,Gran Turismo Sport is a terrible game.  Do yourself a favor and get a different bundle.
1,They sent me two right-sided controllers,"The description says that the product contains a left-side and right-side controller. I received the right colors.... but both right-sided. So I can exactly use them together on my switch or add then both to a controller mount, which was my intention. I would think that the left side WOULD ONLY be made in pink, and the right side WOULD ONLY be made in green. But here they are, two right sides that I can't use. I'm currently overseas in Afghanistan and where I am I don't have the means to send them back. So I'm stuck with them."
1,I didn't listen to the rehash comments,Well...everyone was right.  Nothing that separates it from the MW1 and 2.  Graphics and gameplay is the same.  These really could have been DLC maps and expansion campaigns.  Wow I feel stupid.
1,Buyer Beware-This is not as advertised,"Granted that this did not come with instructions but- inside the box is ""we are here if you need us- contact us through Amazon"". Are you kidding me? There is NO customer service! Plus it appears to be for PC use only. When you load it to a PC it is looking for XBox 360 games!  It does require a cord to function as there is no place to put in the wireless battery.  It is made in China and the ad is FALSE. It claims to be for every machine out there. It uses XBONE instead of XBox one which is what it is being called these days (started on Twitter If you didn't know) but it is NOT AS ADVERTISED.  It is USELESS since who has Xbox 360 games for the PC??? I am still waiting on my refund......"
1,Will not work on american version of wii.,I would give it 0 if I could. Not an accurate description. Recieved a Malaysia version and will not work on our wii. No where  in the description did it say it was not a true american version.
5,Going To Be Huge,"Pokemon Crystal is going to be huge as there are loads of dedicated Pokemon fans out there.  There are that many extra features on this game, its sort of similar to Pokemon Yellow, but it its the addition to Gold and Silver.  You have the option of being Male or Female, and there are a few other feartures.  ....  Gotta Collect Them All. Pika!!!"
5,Great product hands down,My daughter loves them ! Im so happy with purchase and they are so cute . Sound and look great
5,A Full Workout Program Just for ME,"EA's Active is a nice little workout program. Unlike the workout program of the Fit, you get a more customizable workout program targeted to work certain areas of the body. The included resistance band helps build muscle strength and provides a way to do a more traditional workout. The leg strap is a GENIOUS idea for exercises that rely on lower body movement. You no longer have to make sure you're working out in something with a pocket to hold the nunchuck remote. This bundle is a great step up for those that have already gotten bored with the exercises included in the Wii Fit."
4,Timing,"I get the skin and challenges for different skin and other styles and the 2,000 vbucks but it takes like 4 days or 5 to get there"
1,horrible game that says its co-op but really is a one person game,"game looks like it could be fun, but the fact you can only play one player per console is ridiculous. I warn anyone who is buying this game, It is only a one player, you can play with other people online but you cannot play split screen, which is lame."
5,Great fun farming sim!!!,"I used to own this on PC, and it was good but the PS3 offers more challenges and pressure sensitive buttons which making the controls much easier. It is also very simple to learn with detailed tutorials. Great buy, highly recommend!!!"
1,New gameplay? More like new game with minimal objectives,"This game is the biggest disapointment in all sims history. My sims aren't emotionally complex and build mode has been dumbed down so a preschooler can make a four walled house. My sim has been getting stuck and the graphics are horrible. I play on a 55 inch screen and I have to zoom out half way of the lot to not have a blurry view of everything. The graphics won't go any higher. They have very little options for items but rather have different bland color schemes. This game looks like it is a prequel to sims 2. To round this review up. The graphics are horrible, the price is too high, the sims are as stupid as slugs, build mode is the most difficult thing to navigate, the interface for playing forces you to click all over the screen to tiny confusing buttons with some hot keys that don't work. Don't buy this game please. I have never been so disapointed with a new video game in my life. Sad sad day for me and sims"
1,A mockery of the beautiful game,"Player ball control has been slowed to a crawl and makes a mockery of reflexive movements that are supposed to belong to world class soccer players.  If you see a defender coming your way, then it is already too late to evade him as any moves fail to register with the player in time.  Even receiving the ball in stride and maneuvering ahead of time is too slow.  That being said, the game is reduced to crosses from the wing and rebound shooting.  AI is simply a joke as computer players refuse to make even the most basic of soccer plays towards the ball unless they are told to.  I understand they are probably trying to put more control in the players hands, but at a certain point, you shouldn't have to tell players to chase after a loose ball in front of the opponents net. Finally, possibly the biggest problem, is the dysfunction of online play.  Ultimately, the problem lies on EA's hands.  If they are ready to take the consumers money on this game, they should have the game ready especially online play."
4,DOES NOT WORK WITH MAC OS unless it is 10.3 or less version,"I had to learn the hard way after ordering this for my MacBook Pro that this doesn't work unless you have MAC OS version 10.3 or less. I found that out after contact the Learning Company directly. They were very prompt in their response. However, I also have a laptop with Microsoft 7. This program loaded beautifully with the Microsoft base. So, if you have Microsoft 7 or 8, purchase and enjoy this game. Any mac systems will likely have issues."
1,Not for Quest 2,No idea why the seller wrote that this is also for Quest 2. The design is totally different. Will return but pointless waste of time.
1,As good as if it didn't even exist,Not making enough of your product so that people can actually buy it means 1 star.  As good as if it didn't even exist.
1,Not Worth buying at Launch or for Holiday Gift.,"The upgrade and unlock system of loot crates and starcards is a deal breaker. I wish I could return for refund. You will have to pay more money for cards that enhance game play, including things like targeting. It is nothing close to any of the other battlefronts you prevously played.  Im 40, played games for 30 years now, and this is the most disappointing game experience I have ever had considering the history EA and Dice had to build on."
5,Sweeeeeeeet,I have a PS2 and now that i got a PSP i really can now leave the house and get some sunlight....This is a really great handheld device...i recommend to anyone that does not have the time to sit infront of a tv and game.
5,Great Port,"Basically the same exact version of the PS3 version except a few minor control changes that work naturally and flawlessly. The first God of war has its few moments that disappoint like low fps but very mildly, graphics to this game are pretty good except its cut scenes which havent been updated and are in its original PS2 graphics (SD) that is the only annoying thing about the game but it is something that you will forget and eventually accept and enjoy as you progress. There are a few minor bugs In the first God of War but other than that its not anything a new update cant fix... God of War 2 gets way better you can see the improvements in all areas including graphical and fps, fight scenes can get crazy with multiple enemies with extremely extremely rare lag (1 time in god of war 2) Overall an excellent port with a few minor things like you can change between games unless you quit the app and restart. Plays just as good as the original the only thing thats missing is the rumble from the dualshock controllers i deff recommend!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Cool show!!!,"My son has an Alienware setup and needed a decent-sized mouse pad. The light show on this one caught my eye, and it looked to be a good match to what he already had. It turned out to be a good call. The pad was just the right size for the desk and the lights matched the accents of the laptop and headphones. He loves it. I've used his station a few times and the mouse pad works like a charm and is a feast on the eyes. Personally, I would have liked the pad to be a little bigger, but it works just fine in the space available. Setup was a breeze. It wipes up with just a damp cloth."
1,One Star,"Worked fine for about an hour, then stopped working entirely. Returning."
5,Five Stars,"As a fan of neon anything, I just can't get enough of these colors from Nintendo!"
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,Stocked full of bugs and glitches that make this virtually unplayable. Check out the Madden Subreddit if you want countless examples. Wait until January for all the patches to be applied before you even think about purchasing this pile of trash. I've never felt like more of a sucker in my life for pre-ordering this game months in advance for full price.
5,... these headphones for my grandson he loves them he enjoyed the quality the volume of these headphones he enjoyed ...,I bought these headphones for my grandson he loves them he enjoyed the quality the volume of these headphones he enjoyed talking with his friends and engaging and their games I would recommend this to anyone
5,"Great cable, works for Quest 2","This is exactly what I was looking for.  Links my Oculus to the computer without any issues.  Was able to play steam games like Fallout 4 and half life Alex just by linking my quest 2 with this usb cable.  Have it running through a suspension system and it stays connected well.  If this one ever breaks will be purchasing again as it is a quality cable for half the price of the ""oculus"" version."
1,Game crashes when you try to save. Long loading times. Stick to the earlier games or Stardew Valley.,"Crashed when I tried to save, losing hours of work. I wanted to like this game but I cannot spend hours and hours replaying the game when it decides to crash."
5,Great for youth,Great for kids to use for school or gaming.
5,Promising gaming mouse so far!,Great mouse and feels about what a wireless should feel like.  Looks pretty good as well.  Sensitive movement.  Great for gaming!
5,Five Stars,haven't broken yet!
5,Five Stars,Games is an all around improvement on the first. Shipped on time.
1,"Defective by design, beware","This game is infected with Ubisoft's new DRM system that forces you to remain online even if you're playing single player.  If your network goes down, so will the game.  If you want to play on a laptop while not connected, too bad, you can't.  If Ubisoft's DRM server goes down (as it has already) you can't play, either.  You are paying for the privilege of being a casualty in Ubisoft's war against piracy.  The pirated version does not have these problems, ironically.  I simply can't recommend this game to anyone in its current state and am honestly appalled that they have decided to abuse their own customers like this."
1,Sadly as an Xbox user there really isn't another baseball ...,"Sadly as an Xbox user there really isn't another baseball game option, so I went ahead and got it for the Prime member price at pre-order. If I had it to do over, I wouldn't. I'll just wait for xbox to make The Bigs backwards compatible. I knew going into it this wasn't next gen graphics, but I was hoping the physics and handling would be playable. It isn't. I've killed a little time playing it while watching TV as basically all you have to do is hit the A button for literally every action in the game with the computer deciding the rest, there's really no thought required to play it. I wasn't expecting a lot, but I was hoping for at least a little more. Oh well."
4,Solid Choice,"I ordered this controller specifically to use with my Steam gaming account. Initially I spent many frustrated hours trying to get my wired PS3 controller to work with the use of several different free software programs without any success. I finally decided to break down and get a 360 style controller, and it worked perfectly on the first try. Now I can lay in bed and game from my desktop. My only wish is the cord was longer and the cord length was listed in the product description, other than that I haven't had any issues with any of the buttons. They have a smooth action. The controller is a comfortable weight for long game play and the vibration on it is definitely noticeable but not overly powerful. I am really happy with the product and might get a second one so friends can also play on cooperative games."
1,Won't Preorder from Amazon again,"No download code, and now I get an update that it's not arriving on release day, but the next day. Love fallout and Bethesda, but Amazon blew this one for me."
1,Bait and switch,I purchased a few units and was sent generic Bluetooth earphones.
5,Just wanted to let people know the PS5 DOES NOT come with a USB cable.,It never has and I don't believe any PS controller ever came with a USB cable.
1,Don't buy if you need to repair R2 or L2,1st I bought these specifically for the R2 shoulder button the pressure switch wasn't working. Found the rubber pad was cracked. I received these and 1 rubber pad was missing which wasn't a killer since I only needed the right 1 replaced. It looks nothing like the original pad in shape or build but I installed it. The trigger still doesn't work. After inspecting the oem pad has a rounded piece and is closer to the controller this piece is flat and further away. So i have to go back to the cracked 1 with hot glue temporary fix until i find a permanent solution.
5,Must buy for PS4 owners!,"This has helped a lot! It's a huge time saver (due to the Chargers) and it's helped my PS4. I haven't had any issues so far and the fan isn't loud it also fits the console perfectly. The only problem is there's no instructions! But If you have a PS4, this is a must buy!"
1,Terrible game,No campaign and multiplayer has very little depth.
5,As described,I like how I always beat my friends at it.
1,I wanted this edition so bad and now they have all went to the scalpers,"I wanted this edition so bad and now they have all went to the scalpers. Nintendo is not even making all this money, the scalpers are...."
1,Do not buy,Waste of money. It was supposed to come with dongle. It also is missing the.color coding and only has 3 buttons not the 5 needed to play. Wish I could send it back but i dont have the money.
1,Worked for year then exploded,"This charger worked great until today. It was sitting inside my home not on the charger, and the device made a loud noise and exploded. Very strange"
1,Fake ps5,This is a scam
5,Ish is legit. Can't believe I didn't do this ...,Ish is legit.  Can't believe I didn't do this sooner.  I did not have any lag or misconnection with my controllers to my ps4 and i mounted it behind my swivel mounted TV.  I know some have voiced concerns over that..
1,Blank CD-R inside.,Furious I purchased this as a Christmas gift and plastic wrap and seals intact when I got it but when my son opened it Christmas morning we found a blank verbatim CD-R inside.  Now I have to wait for refund and buy another game.
5,GH III totally rocks on the Wii!!!!!!,"I won't bore you with a long, drawn-out review. Guitar Hero III for the Wii is AMAZING! The rumbling guitar is awesome. Haven't tried online game play, but I'm sure that'll be sweet, too. Glad I reserved this game and got it on the day it came out!!! Highly recommended for Wii owners!! And I can't wait for the additional controllers to come out!! Rock on Wii Nation!!!"
1,Completely unacceptable,"My girlfriend is the main person who plays this game, I'm not a fan of the gameplay but she loves it so that's perfectly fine with me. But the freezing that this game is doing is honestly starting to annoy me alot. I am on my 2nd PS3, my first one (the 40gb old model) eventually got the YLOD so I replaced it with the slim. It seems like the game eventually freezes up every time she plays, requiring us to manually walk up to the console and turn it off. Now I really hope that this freezing issue isn't damaging my PS3, but even if it isn't this is a completely unacceptable issue.  I think they've been releasing patches but I don't know if its helping since it's been freezing more than ever. This game may be fun for a lot of people but the glitches and freezing have made it a steaming pile of garbage. It makes me even more angry because the PS3 is the only gaming console we own so I wish the solution could be as simple as getting it for another console."
4,Problems linking the guitars,"This bundle does include the game. Not sure why one of the other reviews says otherwise. This game is very different from the original guitar hero games. Also none of your old guitars will work as this game uses redesigned guitars. This didn't bother me since although I have played them, I've never owned the previous versions.  With this bundle you will learn quickly that the process to link the guitars to your PS4 system isn't user friendly. It took me about 40 minutes of trial and error and researching online to figure it out. This is the only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars. Once you successfully link them, this game is awesome. My daughter and I played it all night and had a blast the day we bought it."
5,"She loved it, and had no difficulties finishing it on ...","Bought it for my 7 year old. She loved it, and had no difficulties finishing it on her own. She's pretty good at games, but i was surprised she was able to complete it without any help. I guess that's great for her, maybe too easy for someone older?"
5,Good buy,"I got lucky when I showed up to country because the guy that lived in the CHU before me left his xbox 360.  The catch?  He burned out the power supply by plugging it straight into a 220v...ouch!  Ordered this baby, got a power converter, and from there it was plug and play.  Product works great, its basically the same one that originally comes with the 360's.  No hiccups as of yet and I've had it for a couple of days.  If you need a new power supply, I recommend this one for sure."
1,"Great Game, DRM Kills it","Avoid the Securom DRM EA includes with this game.  It is very difficult to uninstall from your computer, and severely limits what you can do with this game"
2,LOVE the game...HATE orgins,"Had I known that I would have to download through Origins, I would have bought from a different site. Origins, at least for a Mac, requires a different processor than the game itself. Meaning, even though I BOUGHT my game that was able to be used on my processor, Origins won't let me DOWNLOAD it to be able to PLAY it. Makes sense? It makes more sense to be able to download directly from Amazon rather than go to another website that has different requirements. Never going to buy any game from amazon if it has be to downloaded from Origins again. And if I were able to return the game itself, I would. Sadly, I can not."
5,Nothing,Nothing can stop the animal

1,Unusable product,"Straight out of the box, this headset only played sound through one speaker, and when plugged into my laptop, would only play garbled sound. Would absolutely not recommend."
5,Best,I LOVEEEE It I ALREADY KNOW ITS GGONNA BE THE BEST KEYBOARD IDC HOW LONG IT TAKES TO GET HERE DUDE LIKE THIS IS MY BEST PURCHASE
5,"Very fun game, even for non-fighting games fans.","I am not even fan of fighting games, yet I can't stop enjoying this. Playing as my favorite characters , so many modes and replay value. Playing online etc this game will last you for a long time. The story mode was surprisingly amazing, I mean a great story in a FIGHTING game? hell yeah somehow they pulled that off. Get this."
5,"Real Planes, Real Physics, Real Fun","I have played a lot a flight sims... it's part of my job.  I do work for this little company called Laminar Research which just happens to market a little game called X-Plane.  I can't say much for Young's Modulous (yet) but as far as X-Plane goes, I can tell you that it is the very best flight simulator available and here's why: It wasn't designed for Joe who wants to play a flight simulator game- it was designed for people who actually fly airplanes- for people who like real physics- for people who want to fly in REAL TIME weather and take off from their home airport.  Austin Meyer, the designer of this game, is a genious- a one man team (plus myself, the puny graphics guy) who single handedly programs the amount of stress of every single section of the airplane.  Amazing programing.  What gripes could you have?  Graphics slightly less than par?... All versions include FREE upgrades and patches and thousands of other planes have been modeled by various fans.  Give X-Plane a shot!  Trust me.  Amazing company, ladies and gentlemen.  He gives his very own technical support.) Real Planes, Real Physics, Real Fun.  X-Plane.  Go for it."
2,"Read the reviews.. There's a ""pending"" issue.","Purchased this for my brother..It was Stuck in Pending Purgatory.. for several hours. I didn't receive any kind of confirmation , and it didn't show up in my orders..So after an hour I tried it again.. same situation..This time when checking orders the item did not show up until I set the filter to last 30 days. Of course the previous two gift card orders showed up so I now have four gift cards when I only meant to get two. I finally called customer service they deleted the orders asked me to re-upload my credit card. It was complete hassle... so I re-ordered it at 9 p.m. and it didn't come out of pending until 3 a.m. the following day. I don't know what the issue is but it's obviously something that occurs to a lot of people so next time I need to get gift cards I'll just go to a brick and mortar store since take about the same amount of time to retrieve it."
1,No DRM for me thank you very much,"This game is neat and all but I returned it after finding out that it installed DRM on my computer. From now on, I will be researching PC games I buy and if it has a DRM like this one on it, I'm not buying it."
1,One Star,The Hard Drive is missing and It won't play because of that
1,why???,spider-man is not black.  Thanks for ruining this game. What would happen if they made the black panther white?
1,Overpriced package.  Buy the normal system,100 dollars for screen wipes over the cost of the system straight????
5,worked great and no issues,quick delivery. no issues. I played my PS2 like I did when I was younger for hours and hours on end. no hitches or issues. very happy with my purchase :)
1,Buggy,"This madden was exactly the same as 21. Plus, there are cut scenes and such that just don't operate properly. It was pretty disappointing as I was hoping for ps5 to go a little extra on. Missed opportunity."
1,Save your hard earned money dont buy 19 just go back to 18 19 1-5 STARS 18 4-5 STARS,"MADDEN 19  gets 1 star from me where as 18 gets 4 out of 5 stars . 19 is total trash garbage compared with 18. The only people playing 19 are the idiots who sold off there whole team on 18. 19 does not have real player motion it has robotic motion just like Boston dynamic robots. they bounce like kangaroos on Pogo sticks around the field game is terrible.  This game graphics remind me of madden 2k or NCAA 2005 horrible  chippy , choppy  clunky even after update game is broke. Game makes weird annoying metal smashing sound  when impacting other players so unrealistic and sounds like metal crash.  Auction house is glitchy not smooth at all  like 18. I want my money back i bought the limited edition 3 days early on August 7th.  19 sucks so bad don't waste your hard earned money just go back and play 18."
1,The controls in this game are terrible. A huge learning curve and will require a ...,Stick with Forza. The controls in this game are terrible. A huge learning curve and will require a lot of experimenting. Started in cart and the best I can do is last place and getting lapped. I am ready to put this on the shelf or sell it. I may try it later but at the moment it's not fun.
5,Super kawaii and affordable,For the price I love it! Its super cute and not too huge and functions well. I was going to get the pink razer keyboard but honestly im happy with this one. The colors are great and goes well with my mouse and pc! I guess my only cons are the cord is white instead of pink like in the photo and its also not super long. But otherwise im really happy with this keyboard!
5,Great game!,"My girls love this game.  They get to pretend to be the animal that is featured in the episode (bear cub, mountain lion, etc.).  It gets them up and moving while watching an educational tv show.  I'm very happy we got this one."
5,Worth it,"Got everything listed, and quickly. Yeah its a bit pricy but I'm very happy."
2,The Simpsons,WHEN I FIRST SAW THIS GAME I WANTED IT SO BAD. I GOT IT AND PLAYED IT RIGHT OFF THE BAT. AND BOY WAS I DISSAPOINTED.  THE GAME WAS POORLY MADE.  I THOUGHT YOU COULD MAKE A LOT BETTER CARTOONS THEN THAT. THEY DON'T EVEN  REALLY MOVE.  AND THE SOUND CLIPS BITE. PEOPLE DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON  IT. IT IS NOT HORRIBLE BUT NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO BUY FOR 10 DOLLARS.  PLUS YOU  WILL GET TIRED OF IT RIGHT AWAY. AND IT IS VERY HARD TO CONTROL. THE  BOOKLET DOES NOT HELP AT ALL. I HAD TO LEARN BY MYSELF AND THAT TOOK  AWHILE.
5,"Warning: Before you buy, check this out","I love the Sims 2, but I lost one of my original disks.  While I highly recommend this game (it is a blast), make sure that your computer is DVD compatible before ordering this DVD-Rom.  They have it Cd-Rom, but buyer beware.  Don't be like me, and get the copy in the mail only to find out you ordered the wrong thing."
1,Incomplete and Boring,I bought halo the day that it came out thinking that it was going to be great because it was the first halo to be made for the xbox one. Instead what I and many other players received was an incomplete game that is missing many features that would have made it a fun game. It seems that 343 believed that it would be smart to remove split screen from halo because it was not necessary and fun. They failed to deliver and instead they force us to play a game that is not fun because there is no split screen and it is missing so many game modes such as doubles and snipers. The game is no fun and it is difficult to play when the servers are always disconnecting me from the game. Many people have complained to them about the servers and they refuse to listen and fix the issue. I would not recommend this game and instead I would recommend for someone to find another game to play.
1,Found box to be used and notice that the Wii ...,Found box to be used and notice that the Wii U is not a new how it said it was and found all the sensor bar wiring to be wrap around the sensor bar not how new package supposed to be and the power wire not wrap all of the package is thrown all inside and wire also not how I expected to be this package been open and used forgot to say it didn't came with the game or the hdmi cables how the box say just connect the Wii U but I notice that it keep freezing up and crashing all the time
1,"Snap, Crackle, Pop! A40!!! (from a very angry customer)","The sound pops and crackles every couple seconds. My controllers and console are fully updated, so they are not causing the issue. If it wasn't for that annoying thing, the sound quality is excellent. I did a ton of research on this, as it is extremely annoying, and I found that it is most likely due to a defective adapter (m80). Therefore, since it would be ridiculous to spend even more money on a new m80, since they sent me a defective one, I will only change my review upon receiving a new mixamp m80, or once my issue gets resolved. I spent 200 dollars on this thing because I heard nothing but fantastic reviews about this product, but now that there's a huge hole in my bank account, I immediately regret this decision."
5,Great cords - great quality - super impressed!,"I bought these as a present for my boyfriend for Christmas for our PS4 controllers. He somehow has taken them over for charging cords for his phone as well. Not only has he stolen both of them for charging his phone, his bluetooth speaker, and his wireless headset, but luckily I bought a charging dock station for those controllers otherwise we would never have them charged. He is so happy with the quality and I am so happy I have my USB ports back on my computer lol. I literally was not expecting such great quality and they really are super freaking long. Best cords I have ever purchased off Amazon by far and extremely happy I did. (And yes when I use them for the controllers, they work like a charm!)"
1,My photos are lost,"I've been trying to get information on my ""lost"" pictures for weeks. They keep putting me off with different excuses. I sent in 75 pictures that scan 25 years of our marriage and they don't know where they are. I keep giving information that I must repeat each time I call. Today they say they aren't taking calls."
1,Save Your Money!,"When I first started playing this game, I thought EA Sports finally got it right. After half way through the first season of Dyansty the game froze. After many hours spent on line and with EA Support team the issues remain. Do yourself a favor DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. There has not been any official word of fix from EA Sports."
4,Good Station,"We've had this for a year now and it works well.  It takes about 3-4 hours for a complete charge (we run the controller until it dies each time) and the charge lasts for a long time.  We use the case that the controller comes in so have not had experience with ""rusting"" like a previous reviewer has as the case covers the charging prongs.  Have yet to find a defect in this- and I HATE buying batteries so this is perfect for us.  The only down side is the charging time which is only normal."
5,It's the best.. hands down the best,"I know the other reviews said it was a great product, but they were wrong.. IT'S AMAZING!!! You can tell the time and dedication that was put into this product! I was hesitant to spend the money on it, but so worth it. If you were having doubts, just don't!"
5,Pre-order Backpack,"Awesome game so far- I wanted to share this photo to help people who pre-ordered. The code is for a digital gold backpack in the Nintendo eStore, not a physical backpack. Hope this helps!"
1,They haven't made a good game in 5 years,Done buying NBA 2k. Controls are too unresponsive and new features are weak. They haven't made a good game in 5 years.
1,DOES NOT FIT CONTROLLER,"This is honestly completely ridiculous. This shell doesn't even remotely fit my xbox one controller. DO NOT BUY. This is legitimately a false product. I was originally excited for such a slick looking shell and sure as I knew it it was too good to be true. You were warned here first, remember that."
1,dead on arrival,"The charger does not work and I don't feel like wasting time to contact the seller, return, etc. Just stay away from eforcity"
5,Good and comfortable,Very comfortable in my ear.  People can hear me clearly.
2,"Released too early, only 4 maps, not enough ...","Released too early, only 4 maps, not enough guns... Kinda a letdown!! I would prolly wait a few months to buy this game as it may fizzle out!!"
5,Cheaper Than Antidepressants and More Effective,Animal Crossing is the most wholesome game in the world. You can play this game for half an hour a day or 24 hours a day and get just as great an experience. I cannot recommend Animal Crossing enough. It is pure therapy.
4,Aht Urghan- only available in DVD format.,"Ok, well this expansion looks like it has a lot to offer: 3 new jobs, and a lot of new areas, however, you can only install it if you have a DVD-ROM, or better in your computer. S-E did NOT release a CD-ROM format copy of ToAU."
1,Cord has popped through the braid,Purchased this late September - and it works great - BUT - there are 2 spots where the cord has popped right through the braid.  Although it is a comfortable and very quick mouse - great for gaming - I am not happy with the way the cord has come through the braid.
5,"Oh, she's a happy girl!","I bought this set for my 9-yr old daughter, who believes the world should exist in every shade of pink, imaginable! She originally wanted a sleeve for her 3DS, but as we were scrolling around the site, we came across this set . It had everything she could possible need! They arrived quickly, and she was well on her way to protecting, and amplifying, and cleaning, and plugging-in, and doing all kinds of groovy things with her 3DS. I think for the money, it was way well worth it, and she seems totally happy, so that's the best bottom line, right?"
5,"I don't know about you guys, but I got everything as promised. Great product!","I was looking for a Wii console that is new enough to work well and connect to wifi, but not the newest model (read: more expensive) so I did a little research before purchasing. I know other people have reported the Wii Sports game as missing from the box and that the plug was not compatible with U.S. outlets, but I ordered this package in April and everything was included and works well. Maybe the seller is doing better quality control to make sure everything is in the box that is supposed to be in it, but I have had absolutely no problem with this product. I had read the reviews before ordering and considered the number of reviews posted (people are more apt to write a review when there is something bad to report... plus there were only 7 reviews whereas some other products have hundreds so you get more of an idea of the consistency of the seller in that case) and more or less took my chances figuring I could return it if I was dissatisfied. However, everything is great and was in the original packaging! Also, as a novice in the area of gaming consoles, I was able to hook everything up and get it going very easily. Very happy with my purchase."
5,Great purchase :),"Purchased this as a gift for my other half, we got lucky and it came in about 4-5 days after purchasing. After the other half and I wrestled to see who got to open it first (I won :D) we saw that it came exactly as described and he instantly swapped out his old controller for it. He's been wanting this controller for awhile now and it was definitely worth the wait for him. :) He loves the feel, buttons, and control of it. (Might get one for myself...soon.:)) But wonderful service, thank you for the note, and glad to be part of the 7 Watts family! :)"
1,Just buy a new one,After one day it began saying error and displayed the screen on the photo for 20 minutes and then it restarted again. This happened continuously over two hours. If your going to buy something this expensive just pay 10 dollars more for a new one.
5,DBZ Complete Series,I received the set fast and unopened just as advertised. All of the dvds were fresh. Nothing beats classic tv. You can't put a price on epicness!
5,Singstar and Queen -- no way you can go wrong,"Let me first start by saying that I am a singstar addict. I have all the games released so far in the US for the PS3, I imported the wireless mics from Europe, and I am considering buying other titles that have been released in Europe, but not here. With that said here is my review. The Singstar format is still the same: Online Store, Online Community, and Game play. Why fix it if it isn't broke? Queen is one of the greatest rock bands of all time with so many recognizable hits, so Singstar really has a winner with a title that has so many memorable songs. You can play alone, in a duet, or even as a group... it's tons of fun. There are of course other titles with different artists, but if you are a Queen fan, this is a must have. So, get it, and sing, sing, sing... become a SingStar!"
1,"Great machine, wish it actually worked","Love my PS3 and I was really looking forward to spending all weekend playing my new PS4.  Got it delivered after work Friday evening and hooked it up.  Started playing Killzone multiplayer and voice-chatting with my brother, made it about 10 minutes and the PS4 shut off with no warning.  Now its totally bricked.  Doesn't output anything, won't boot into safe mode, and just pulsates a blue light.  Spent 2.5 hours waiting to talk to someone at Sony customer support.  They were very polite, but the only option to get a new one is to send it to them for service and wait 2 weeks.  Judging by how long I was waiting I'm betting this problem is a lot more widespread than originally reported.  The ten minutes I spent with it were fantastic, it's an awesome machine.  But that doesn't really do much good if its just a brick until after thanksgiving most likely.  Really put a damper on what I thought would be a fun launch weekend.  So disappointed in this."
5,Best video game to date.,"I am a LoD addict...I even have it on my ipad...This is truly my favorite game EVER made. It is such a great turn based battle game. I love that the characters don't just do one slash attack. You have to time the additions up to 7 times to complete your attack and if you miss, some bosses will counterattack and knock you on your ass. You get a whole different set of moves and attacks when you charge up your Dragoon gauge. I would pay to see this game remade during my lifetime."
5,Awesome headset for gaming and chat!,"This product produces excellent sound quality in game- and also in team chat. I noticed a difference in voice quality both when I heard people through the headset and when my friends heard me, stating I sounded clearer. It helped with locating footsteps of enemies in games too with clear sounds. The colors, when the headset is plugged in, are vibrant and produces great atmosphere. I would recommend to anyone looking for a gaming headset"
1,Joystick got stuck towards the left playing Mario Kart and ...,Joystick got stuck towards the left playing Mario Kart and makes the controller unusable now. Felt cheaper and stiffer than the joy-cons the Switch came with.
1,IT'S A TRAP!!!!!!!!!!!,"Remember when you bought a game, you took it home and played it with your friends, and there was no additional cost? Yeah this isn't that game. No story mode. Just a sham of paying extra every month to play a game online with jerks and foul mouthed a-holes who take video games way to seriously."
5,Great Game,"More refined and polished game. If you are going in as a new player, it's a great experience. As a lover of the originals, I did notice when things were changed but it didn't detract from the game. I enjoyed the added side quests, as well."
5,THE FUTURE OF GAMING,"This is the most amazing thing I've ever experienced! I am completely amazed! VR is most definitely the future of gaming! First game I fired up was Eve Valkerie. Wow! I was in the game! In the ship! When I was about to take off, my adrenaline kicked in and next thing I know, I'm shooting drones, flying through ship debris and having massive space dogfights! I never was so into a game in my life! After that, I was checking the view on a beach near Mt. Fuji! The way the VR completely puts in the game is astonishing! I see a very bright future for PSVR, and just VR in general. Heck, Skyrim? In VR? Very bright indeed."
1,One of the worst games I've ever played,"This is not a review because I'm a new player and the game is too hard. I am a high level player of these NHL games and after a full week of playing and giving it countless chances, I can say that this is one of the worst games of all time. The features are amazing. I love how in depth the game is. But the gameplay itself is beyond pure garbage. The opposing AI will never ever be off your player. They can read exactly where you're going and make turns as you make them. Physics means nothing to the opposing AI while your AI is a joke. Passing feels completely random and don't even bother using stick lift. It doesn't work. The AI has a recovery time of zero while you get held down by unrealistic physics. I can't even begin to explain how frustrating it is. I like things to be difficult. I don't want to easily win every game. Losing games is good because that means the challenge is there. But I cannot deal with feeling cheated because of how unfair the game is. Winning even feels bad because the experience is so frustrating. EA is awful and I cannot stress enough that no one should waste their money on this horrible game."
5,DLC is worth the extra cost-major expansion,"I would first say that people need to ignore the reviewer who said it didn't install from steam.  That was a misunderstanding of the delay for steam updating the game.  It is now on steam and downloads and works fine.  The expansion does what it advertises, and that is a bit more than previous expansions.  Like the Sword of Islam and Republic expansions, it adds playable groups, this time the Pagans (Including norse, baltic, african, and mongol strains of pagans), as well as Zoroastrians.  It also adds an earlier start date, something not done in previous expansion DLC.  If you ever wanted to play as vikings, as Lithuanians, as mongols (including the great Genghis Khan and his descendants), or start at the beginning of some of the great dynasties in Europe, this is a well worthwhile DLC to get."
5,Here's a solution to those who say this game is hard...,"This game is FUN and it's a must-have for those who love Sonic the Hedgehog (like me). As I've read in negative reviews, many people think this game is just too difficult to play. One thing that helps for those who agree, is if you go to options and change the WII remote position to VERTICAL MODE rather than it's default HORIZANTAL MODE. Seriously, it's WAAAAAAAY easier to play the game that way! It'll still take some time to get used to, but once you have it, it'll be EASY and a total blast! I highly recommend this game and changing the WII remote settings to VERTICAL MODE. Enjoy!"
5,Does Work!,This controller does work with your PS4 and very much feels like a ps controller. I like  this a lot. the battery life doesn't seem as good as a ps controller but that doesn't bother me. I really just wanted a ps4 controller that wouldn't be 40 or more dollars. This very much fit the bill.
5,Perfect replacement parts!,Everything worked great! The new analog thumb sticks work perfectly and no more drift! I'm happy it came with 4 metal locks since 3 of my Joycons were loose.  The two screwdrivers are the perfect size. No striping the screws!
5,"Lots of fun, but you'd better have a fast computer.","I adore SimCity 3000, but I have to admit it can be a frustrating  experience on a slower machine.  I have a Pentium 233MMX, which admittedly  is old, but still well within the System Requirements stated by Electronic  Arts.  Unfortunately, even with all the animations and processor-hogging  options turned off, the game still runs slowly as the city expands.  I'm  sure it's great on a PII or faster, but sadly the old Pentiums just don't  cut it.  If you've got a faster machine you'll love it, but people with  older machines might want to stick with older versions of SimCity until  they upgrade."
1,"It should remain a fun, carefree time for girls","Short. Puzzle driven. The whole purpose of the game was to solve puzzle after puzzle after puzzle. ND is about solving mysteries and following clues. The game included a woman who was married to another woman (see photo); this is not true to the ND theme and concept. Since the games are targeted toward girls aged 10 and up, parents should have been warned ahead of time so they could choose whether or not to expose their daughters to this.  All political platforms should be kept out of ND games. It should remain a fun, carefree time for girls."
1,Cant use any tokens.. free or purchased.. UK region game not US,My son loves the game but can't redeem the tokens that came with it because this game is a UK region game. Cant even purchase tokens on ps4 either because it's a UK game and our region is US. It won't work because they are two different regions. You should put that in the description.
4,my 6 year old seems to enjoy it....,"We have a long commute to and from school, and we play games in the afternoon to unwind before homework. My son prefers the autobot game to the decepticon one, as it is a bit easier for him."
5,Awesome and works with Razer Huntsman Elite!,These kaycaps are amazing!!! I love how they look on my Razer Huntsman Elite! I wish all of the caps were compatible but I understand that Razer uses a non-standard bottom row... Honestly even with the few caps that can't be swapped it still looks perfect! I also like the feel of the caps a little better than the stock ones from Razer
5,Coolest keyboard EVER,Coolest keyboard ever!
2,Panty Raider: What a waste of money,This was a horibble game. All you have to do is take a picture of 3 models in there underware(no nudity in this game). After that the game is done. It took me 5 min. to beat this games. If I would have know this before I bought it I wouldn't have. This is one of the worst games I ever bought.
5,Love Em!,Work great!
5,Unbelievable,The most graphically impressive game i have played in my 25 years of gaming and honestly nothing comes close...nothing. This like playing a pixar movie in IMAX 3D. And also the game its self is great and super fun.
1,Don't buy this for gaming,The description states for gaming and works with PlayStation and switch it doesn't just spend the money for the elgato.
5,Turtle beach headset worthy,I have a 600 stealth for an Xbox. Got a PC and wanted to keep the headset. Bought this. Plugged it in. Pressed the pairing button on both devices and bingo. Mic and headphones. No issues. Good into so far (2 hours)
1,One Star,It wasn't like the pictures
5,Exciting and good looking single player game.,"After reading the great reviews of this game I went out and bought a Gamecube just to play it and I'm glad I did.  After finishing Ninja Gaiden on the Xbox, I have been searching for the next great game.  I tried Doom 3 on my PC, but was unsatisfied.  I also tried various Xbox games, but none were as good as Ninja Gaiden.  Well I can honestly say that this game is as much fun, if not more, than Ninja Gaiden.  The graphics are not quite as good as Ninja Gaiden on my 94"" diagonal projection system, but I am trying to get the Gamecube component cables to improve the picture quality.  Gameplay is good.  The contols are well designed and the game is not too hard and not too easy.  Save points seem fairly spaced.  One caveat is that you can buy guns, health, but not ammunition.  This forces you to choose your weapon to match your opponent and use it wisely to conserve ammo.  I highly recommend this game."
5,Quite simply the BOMB!,"I love this game!  Okay so I am a Magic addict, not only that but I am female which I have found out is a rare creature in the realm of Magic, and it's many mysteries.  This game is great fun, especially if you don't get  to play the card game very often.  There are two ways of playing, you can  make up your own deck and then play against the computer or you can use the  interactive part of the game and go into the land of Shandalar and try and  defeat the five Wizards, each Wizard representing a different land type.  This works in a similar way to playing the computer but in this way you can  collect rare and unique card along the way to boost the basic set you are  allocated with.  There are four levels, Apprentice, Magician, Sorcerer and  Wizard.  I would recommend that if you are a beginner go as an apprentice  because it is easier.  Playing on the Wizard level is like playing in a  real tournament, and can be exceedingly frustrating! Apprentices play with  a one-colour deck rather than mixed colours, which makes an easier game all  round.  Like in the card game, the computer version gives its cards the  same strength and weaknesses.  Blue being based on spells and magic, green  being earthy and fast etc.  The graphics are good, as are the sound effects  and you feel you are actually getting a prize when you win cards off the  creatures you challenge.  You can go around Shandalar picking up extra  cards by trading amulets that you are allocated at the start of the game,  or buy buying them with gold that you win, steal, or are given.  It's a fun  game, that is totally addictive.  I have been told there is an expansion  pack available but I have yet to find it.  All the same it is a great  computer game and well worth having if you love Magic and want to play the  game on your own."
1,They suck,They suck
5,"Better than I thought, especially for the price",Well-made and affordable. Securely and efficiently stores 24 cartridges..
5,Seller has good customer service for issues.,"White not black, games were well used but work. New yoga mat. All items shipped separate."
5,5 stars if you bought this at Amazon,Unfortunately I didn't buy Simcity from Amazon and opted for the direct download from EA's Origin.  Now I'm stuck with a game that's barely playable and I have no recourse to get a refund. In the future if it's available through Amazon I'm buying it here.
1,"The review is for Amazon, not the game.","I'm sure the game is fantastic, but don't order it from Amazon, even if you have Prime membership. Their supposed ""release day delivery"" is a joke; I pre-ordered a month ago, and they still haven't even shipped it. Again, I'm sure the game is awesome, but Amazon is not."
5,"Own Ocean, Own Rainforest","Both games have a similar style, even though the individual games are different. I own both. These are relaxing, addictive games to help unwind from the daily grind.  I have seen a growing number of adult games for DS that have really impressed me. These two games are wonderful play while watching t.v. or just for taking a lunch break...."
5,Great and fast,This was delivered very fast and in great packaging. Very great and works perfect. Only 1 dissatisfying things is it didn't come with the little headphone mic but I can buy one easy. Will definately look at this sellars page for gaming stuff.
1,Beware,I returned mine. The factory seal was broken and it was an older unit. Got a brand new 2018 unit from GameStop with the factory seal intact for a hundred less.
5,Works perfect. Does exactly what it says.,"Been playing on the 1st charge for days. Couldn't tell you how many hours. I always seem to lose track of time when playing. So far I am impressed and would recommend it to anyone who does not want the hassle of AA batteries. I imagine that translates to almost everyone. I purchased the white to match my One S. A black version is also available, Unless something drastic happens in the long run You can't go wrong with this purchase."
4,Good replacement for original bar,"This is as close to the original bar as you can get without buying a refurbished one straight from Nintendo (and at a higher price).  I had to replace it twice after my cat discovered how fun it is to chew the cord.  The only real complaint I have about it is that I wish they could thicken the cord on it.  It seems like a lot of people have pets or vaccuum cleaners eat it.  I also have to put the sensor bar on a stand and on top of a book so it can sense my remote correctly, but I had the same problem with the original one too so I think half of that is a problem with the controller itself."
5,Works in Canada!,"I was a little concerned about this, since it states USA only, but it was on sale, and I figured it was worth a try. THe code works even in Canada!"
5,Quality Item,I am more than satisfied with my purchase. Thank you!
1,will be returning,"Well its too late for me to cancel my order so I will be returning this for a refund,I didn not know this was gonna join the same fate as Spore with the limited 3 install crap,I change my Hardware and reinstall my OS at least once every 6 months to keep things running smooth,Its really a shame that they are screwing over the paying customers and that Crytek is falling victim to EA's hair brained scheme to decrease piracy when infact all this is doing(as we can tell by the reviews here) that it will only promote a higher piracy rate on this game,Hope they learn their lesson when this game only sells maybe 100,000 copies which would only be to the unknowing group of casuals,Well I will rebuy this item when and if they take this limited amount of intsalls off"
5,Great upgrade,"Even if you have or haven't played p5 play this it's the ""complete version."
5,If you ever move your Xbox One X around... Buy this!,"It works perfectly for the xbox one x. I move back and forth daily from house to house to apartment and I don't know how I did it before this honestly. More than enough room for cords and controllers and a few gadgets. Headset did not fit (Mine is very large, a smaller one would probably depending on what else is inside) but I was not expecting it to anyway because of its awkward shape and clunkyness. Hard outer shell protects everything so there are no worries. Highly highly recommended for anyone who moves an xbox one x around."
5,This mouse rocks!,"I am a computer accessory geek. I buy mice and keyboards like some women by shoes and I have to say that this is hands down the best mouse I have ever used. It is comfortable, light, smooth and just damn cool to look at! I have one on my Mac and one on my XP machine and it works just as good on either one. Highly recommend!"
1,Caution! May brick your PS4,"This game appears to have been released to soon. Various glitches. Last one crashed my PS4.  The game could be fun, but not yet. Horrible story. Tedious loading screens. The 2 stars are for the game play and battle, which is fun. At first. Then it becomes repetitive. The graphics are good, but again the map all has the same basic look. Hopefully some updates will solve some of these issues. Update: Changed to 1 star. This games crashes all the times, freezes my PS4 and is completely unstable. This will be the last game I ever purchase with EA or Bioware attached to it."
4,Rome Total War Anthology,"Works on Windows7, is very stable. Longest time I have had this game up is 18 hrs. No bugs or Game crash unless the optional settings are pushed, such as highest quality Video options with the Huge units option  . This tends to increase instability. I am currently using a Toshiba Satellite L775 64 bit system, 6 GB ram, 500 GB Hard Drive. My screen size is 17.3 inches and the wide screen option on this game doesn't fill the entire screen. Over all this classic game is still very playable. The seller was prompt, and packaged the shipment very well."
5,Comfortable even with big ears,"To be fair this is my first wireless headset but I really like these, I play video games and do a lot of zoom meetings, and these work really great for both of them. Even out of the box, the installation was ridiculously easy, plug and play, then I just turned on the headset and it was ready to go. I also really like how it mutes the mic when you lift it and it feels pretty light. The only thing I do dislike is that it does get a little warm around my ears but then again that might just be because of my big ears."
4,Pretty good.,"What else needs to be said, it's Minecraft for the PS4. I bought this game for my son as he loves Minecraft and so far he's loving this game. That's the good. The bad? There are elements in this game that push you to purchase additional things. For instance, you need a PSN subscription to play multiplayer. Ok, that's fine and pretty much expected. Other things like theme packs (i.e. Halloween), can be played but the world cannot be saved unless you make an additional purchase. Overall though it's a nice game."
1,Burns through batteries,This thing works great but you only get about 6 hours of game play out of it (and it takes 4 batteries!!).  I've had this for about a month and am ready to throw it away to save money.
5,Five Stars,Grandson loves it!!
5,My daughter is very happy,It is working as good as the originals my kids use the controls and they haven't complain. They are happy playing in this quarantine times.
5,Evercool Defender Turbo - Working GREAT!,This isn't a game.  It's a cooling fan. It's amazing and the only one that I found to work properly for the old school PS3 system. It was delivered quickly and I have been using it for months now.  I was off of work with an injury and literally had my ps3 on for 14 hours a day.  I hardly ever heard the playstation's fan come on to cool itself.  This has definately been a worth while purchace.
4,No manual or instructions included.,It is a great game but I sure wish there were some instructions.  I am at 73 years old and do not have the knowledge of a 10 year old  to work with these things.  If I could find a manual or instructions somewhere I would be extremely pleased!
1,Not a good value,Didn't work at all. Had to return it. There aren't any instructions on how to use it and it doesn't work with all headphones. I'd say buy it if you already know it'll work but maybe go in person to scoop one.
1,"VERY DISSAPOINTED DIDNT WORK ON ARRIVAL (""BLINKING BLUE LIGHT OF DEATH"")","First of i been waiting for the ps4 for half a year of pre-ording it and when it arrived at my house today i plugged it in really easy ( 5 min ) i followed all instructions perfectly, and when i turned it on for  the first time all i got was a blank screen on my tv ( no signal ) and a repeating blinking blue light on my ps4 , i did everything from changing the tv, hdmi cable and even installed and reinstalled the hdd, and still nothing, i did everything anybody has stated and nothing, i still get the same thing , and its not the the hdmi port being mess up because i had checked closley and its fine, pluggs in perfect. Im very dissapointed , and for anybody whos looking to buy this or the ps4 i advise yall to wait for sony to fix this problem because im pretty shure most of every body who bought a ps4 got a similar problem from what i got."
2,It's getting more praise than it deserves,No where we good as the ones on 3DS. The game performs bad on switch with low frame rate and more pixelation then a nes game. What magic the other games had are gone. This game is bland with glitchy boss fights. Adding to the mix that an enemy counter attacks you if you heal sometimes the enemy will be in default mode and hit you then get four more turns. Talk about a dumb design choice. I love turn based rpg games. I love jrpg games but this is as mediocre as they come. It seriously needs a performance patch and game tweaks to be considered OK.
4,Pretty good EA,"Well, to start off this review I have to say I have never played a FIFA videogame on the Wii before so I gave this a try. The players look somewhat cartoonish and the fans are still pixelated. The game is not Gamecube controller compatible, but the controls are easy to learn especially with the nunchuck. The game starts out with you naming your city and team. From there you can go to Intercity Mode where you can make your team a world class team. Other modes are your usual tournament mode, streets to stadiums mode, and a street mode. Streets to Stadiums mode is where you can create a player and make him a star. It's basically Be A Pro mode. Streets mode is my favorite as of now. It's a basic street futsal 4v4 match. It's fun because you can do tricks off the wall and use power ups too. The Wii FIFA is made more of a fun to play with friends type of game as to where Xbox or PS3 FIFA's are meant to be more competitive. FIFA 15 for the Wii is a game to play if you want arcade style play. If you want more realistic play stick to Xbox or PS3."
5,Nice Color. PINKKKKK,Nintendo is my childhood memory. Pink color is fantastic. I bought two machines. One for myself and another one is for my girlfriend. We both like it.
5,Solid product. My favorite option out there.,"I rarely write reviews but I wanted to for this. Great little case. Plastic feels nice and thick. Not at all flimsy. Case opens and closes perfect, aligns nicely. The game slots are great as well. Nice and easy to pop the games in and out, yet they're very secure. Would recommend!"
1,DO NOT BUY FOR DEPLOYED MILITARY,I purchased this a a pre-order.  I did not see any requirement on the order page showing that an internet connection is required.  If you are thinking about purchasing this game for a deployed military member they will not be able to install or play it.  Maybe someday when I get back to home I will be able to take advantage of the fifty bucks I spent.
5,Best there is!,"I own 9 hidden object games, from The Hidden Object Show to Ravenhurst, and this is the FUNNIST and most enjoyable game I own.  I love the screensaver option and, although the same layouts exist, it's a new game every level.  I highly recommend this one if you're going to spend the money."
5,Works as advertised,"The product worked as advertised. Had a little trouble getting my PC to recognize the kinect, but I don't believe it was product related."
5,Persona Souls,Just the right amount of  frustration mixed with enjoyable Atlus RPG mechanics.
5,Visual Masterpiece but.  not everyone's cup of tea,Make no mistake. This game is not a shooter or an action adventure. The developers were going for only thing. Providing a cinematic experience. And that they have delivered in spades. This game is hands down best looking console title. It tells an interesting story with excellent characters and  rich lore. If you are not ready for a cut scene heavy linear experience where  story and dialogues take precedence over plain shooting then you might want to rent or borrow the game. But if you like me are tired with open world nonsense where most of time is spent on fetch quests and collecting parts (DAI) this is a welcome relief. Looking forward to a sequel where they can improve on many aspects namely improved gameplay and reduced QTE.
1,Worst Forza game ever,"I wish I could give this game zero stars because it doesn't even deserve a single star. I am a long time Forza fan, I've been playing since the first game and this is just trash. Everything started going downhill with Horizon and this is the nail in the coffin for me: I will never buy another Forza game."
5,I would recomend.,"Works great, fast shipping and priced right. Would recomend!"
5,my second one!,I got a second one because the noise cancellation is great!
5,Hours of Fun,"Be prepared for a few hours of setup before playing the game - patience pays off!  Another great idea from Nintendo! Just when you thought you had seen everything in gaming, Nintendo surprises regularly! A fantastic gift for kids! My son and daughter both love the robotic arms!"
1,Broken within a month,"Bought these for my fiancee for his birthday a month ago and they are already broken. There is absolutely no sound coming through and when I tried to see if I could send these back in to get new ones since they are basically still brand new, there is no return policy. Extremely disappointed."
4,fun but no real improvements,"Ok Ill start out that nothing really has been upgraded. Maybe the graphics...a tiny bit. Over all its an rpg where you build your character and your fate. Choose you style rogue, mage or warrior or change on the fly. Your never locked in to one way. So if your not a fan of the original game don't bother. But i love the game, and always trying to complete all the quest...its crazy huge and fun to play. I guess they are adding another DLC in 2021 so...there is something."
5,Motocross Madness 2 - Finally!,I have been testing Motocross Madness 2 on beta and let me tell you that this may be the number one game of 2000. I have played MCM1 since it's release and never before has a game held my attention like this one. I am a  retired racer and have always missed the feel and excitement of dirt bikes  and racing Motocross. After I retired the smell of a weedeater running  would send chills up my spine. But now that there is Motocross Madness  these feelings can be vented through the most exciting game ever made. But  wait! Now there is Motocross Madness 2! With a totally new look and even  more realistic feel. The new Motocross Madness 2 will bring racing on the  PC into the 21st century and beyond. You can't go wrong on this one. Plus  you can race the computer guys or go online with the big boys. Order now!  This is truely an awesome game. It also rocks! Cya in the Zone.
5,My daughter loves this keyboard,"My 13 years old daughter has a fancy Mac computer. She doesn't like the Apple keyboard at all. She begs me to buy this keyboard for her. She has been using it for a couple of months now and she just loves it. For a fraction of the price of the Apple, I must say that this keyboard looks pretty darn good, and it works very well too. Money well spent as my daughter uses this keyboard (and her computer) to do her homework and assignment, and she gets straight A's. Oh yeah, I'm a proud Dad ;-)"
1,Does NOT work on an Xbox X,"We bought this to use on an Xbox, which the ads said it would and it has a switch to chose which system you are using it with (Xbox or PC).  I feel this was deliberately misleading on the company level. We are sending it back and getting a Thrustmaster system which IS made to work on the Xbox."
2,"Wait for bargain bin, if that.","I have the exact same issues as ""Jake"", so I am glad to know I am not crazy. My kids (7 and 5) don't want to play this game anymore, so I gave it a try. The targeting function with Buzz's laser, a necessity, is ridiculous. The camera has to be adjusted almost non-stop with the directional buttons in order to see where you are going, forcing you to stop and move it every few seconds. I don't own many games but I thought that Disney in 2010 would release a fun, high quality game for their biggest franchise ever. This game, with its graphics, the horrible control responsiveness, and the ridiculous amount of loading screens, feels like a PC game from 10 years ago. And holy moly they play that ""You've Got a Friend in Me"" song on an endless loop (If you like this song, you won't after 30 minutes of this game). The first good review and the expensive looking ""commercial"" on the page led me to give this game a try. I am writing this to ask you to play it somewhere first before you buy it. It burns my biscuits that they released this poor game and are marketing it as if it is worth fifty dollars. Lesson learned."
1,Wth is this,"This game looks awful, plays awful, no campaign no lobbys, you have to exit after each match, the controls and gameplay feel awkward, will be sending back."
5,Cheap and looks great.,"the keyboard feels excellent to the touch and responds fast, the price is great, all around nice keyboard."
5,Works as needed,Easy to hook up
1,Steamy pile of ...,"The games themselves are ok. But the fact that everything is attached to Steam is awful. The worst piece of software I have ever seen. Support does not exist. No phone support at all, email requests been unanswered for over a week and now to top it all the account has been deactivated for no apparent reason. I am doing a chargeback and not buying anything from Valve ever again."
1,Save your money.,Horrible knock off of a genuine nintendo controller. Stiff and overly sensitive joystick makes it nearly impossible to play with. I also received the wrong color(gray instead of black). Overall I am dissatisfied with this purchase.
2,Fun but Too Short,"At first glance, this game has some very positive features, including a variety of minigames and a fun storyline that adds to the entertainment.  The minigames themselves work well as they are quite varied and include activities such as putting out fires by moving the Wii wand back and forth or racing away from authorities that are attempting to apprehend an alien companion.  Where this game seems to fall short is on length as even if played casually this game can probably be finished in a few hours.  After that, you will find yourself competing in the same minigames, which may be fun if played in a group but may not be very satisfying from a single-player perspective.  Additionally, unlike the original Cars game for Wii, there really is a limited focus on true racing, and there is no real open-ended racing where one can select differing characters and tracks in which to compete.  Overall, this game might be a good option provided one is looking for a group game that is easy to pick up and play in a group setting but for the price tag I would have hoped for more options."
5,Great for 3ds arrived on time,yahoo thanks
5,Love it,I got my son this for Christmas. He absolutely loves it. I was even impressed by the quality of everything. Love how the keyboard and mouse lights up too. Well worth the price.
5,BUY! Worth the every penny!,"Very happy with my purchase! Got an amazing deal on it, and it came in perfect condition, unopened box, all the cords, little head set, one controller and charger included and works perfect! My boyfriend is in love with it! Thank you!!!"
5,Outstanding product.,"To begin with the cable in incredible long, 10 feet more or less. Which is great because you never know when you might need that extra four feet. The controller has good response times and the buttons are feel great. I still have to break it in a bit but for any those who want a good controller for SSBM this is probably the best your going to find. It's incredibly responsive that moon walking with The Captain and even minis with Ganon are extremely easy. Even shine wavedashes all day, lol. I guess the color is cool because it matches the Wii but I really don't care that much, could just spray paint a regular one if I wanted it for aesthetics. Overall great controller, just hope it can taking a melee beating."
1,Nobody should be paying over 500 for there Xbox series x this is scam,Amazon should not allow this whatsoever this is scamming someone for double the price make it 500 or I will report this
4,I like the game,"I have been playing for a while and have created strange weapons, and acquired lots of powers.  I am a casual gamer and not the kind that is going to memorize dozens of moves or even remember half of them in combat but I am still doing OK in the fighting.  I have been doing quests and traveling, but struggling a bit with a boss fights when you have to fight a certain way.  The game was worth it for me.  I am a fan of Horizon: Zero Dawn, The Witcher, and The Ghost of Tshuma."
5,Great Guitar,Too bad it only works for rock band!  This is an awesome guitar (and it looks cool too!).
5,Great game for kids,"This game has just the right amount of complexity for kids. My kids are 9 and 12 and they love this game. The graphics are fantastic (and demanding). The game did freeze once but since I've installed the update, I've not had any problems. If you are looking for complex adult entertainment that comes with a steep learning curve, this is not the game for you. The city simulation is pretty basic but this allows you to try different city scenarios without getting wrapped up in the complexity of a myriad of simulation details. You can for example have two areas in your city plot. Have happy sims on one half and make real angry sims on the other. Then, create jails and swat teams on the good side to try to stave off the invading irked sims looking for a better life. I would have like to see some deeper dimension of city life simulation, but the game is fun as it is so I don't mind. If you tend to stop playing games because they get too complicated or hard, you'll like this game."
5,Nice wireless switch controller for a reasonable cost.,"My nephew got a Nintendo switch for xmas, I wanted to help out and get him a neat wireless controller. He is only 8 so I really didnt want to spend a ton of money on something that he is most likely isnt going to take the best care of yet I didnt want something to cheap that it would broken in 2 days. I believe this controller is the perfect happy medium. He has had it for a few weeks now and it is in perfect working condition. And he plays with it daily for a few hours. It was easy to connect and play with."
5,Great,The product is great and is easy handle and connect.
5,Perfect so I do not have to use autopay,Finally I found a way to pay early. I will continue to use this so I do not have to use autopay.
5,a upgrade to p5,i know it will be fun 3 and 4 were fun to play 5 is even better
1,Bootleg copies,"I bought Seasons 1 through 7.  When it arrived from Shanghi, China I was supicious.  Upon carefully examining the first season I found it was in cardboard sleeves.  Then I discovered the UPC code was incorrect and the stamps on the back of the CD's were also incorrect. The quality of the CD's were not bad for bootleg because the seller was crafty in the way he copied all the menus, etc., but it was not legit.  Beware of a deal that looks too good to be true!"
5,Perfect controller have no fear order this,So far everything has worked perfect. The control sticks are tighter than the original Sony brand controller which helps with precise aiming needed in shooting games. The controller worked immediately when I connected it.  I'm looking forward to playing all my favorite games again with this new controller. I'm also planning to order a couple more because this is such a good controller for around 15 bucks.
1,Preordered Item is NOT as Pictured.,"Not happy, I preordered this item and what I received is NOT at all like the pictures.  See pics I attached.  No clear cradle with LED backlight to indicate charge status, and I actually do not believe the model I received is even working; when plugged in with either one or two controllers docked with battery installed (only goes in one way), zero charge status lights on the front - display is dark.  I'd compare to instructions or troubleshoot, but the product came with none!  There was only a warranty card in the box.  Bad luck this week, the second item I'd had to return (unrelated).  Sending this back immediately."
1,"DOA, Piece of Junk, RROD,","Bought it at best buy, 2 hours ago. Hook it up, nothing on the HDTV screen. Restart and RROD,,What a shame,"
4,Great graphics and boss foghts,Only gave this a 4 star as i love the graphics and boss fights are pretty challenging.  Although ff15 is still better in my opinion as i love open world and lots of side quests.  The side quests in 16 are lackluster and not that exciting and pretty simple.  I tan out of side quests to do pretty fast as doesn't seem to be an abundance like in 15.  I do not like the more linear aspect also and wish they had made it more open world.  Overall its a fun game but just a little disappointed after playing 15
5,Climb up the scoreboard,"Takes a little time to figure out how to manipulate it but once you get used to it you can play your favorite FPS games with a huge advantage. The paddles have a natural feel and is shaped perfectly with the controllers design. Personally I use the kontrolfreekz grips, I cut out a portion of the grip and it makes for a more comfortable fit so it's flush in your hand rather than further away from the controller. The click of the strike pack is nice and easy to get used to, adapt your playing style to this thing and you'll never want to play without it."
4,Great game but it freezes on me.,I love this game. I love art too and kind of reminds me of photoshop but for a switch. Wish they had a blending tool. The troubleshoot was very helpful especially when i bought my switch in 2018. The pen didnt connect right away to my switch and looked at the troubleshoot and read that there is a trick with 2018 switches which helped  The only problem is it keeps freezing and i cant do anything. The way i fix that is hit the home button and go back to the game. Then like in 5 to 10 mins it freezes again and gets annoying.
4,"Interesting game, provides good experiences","This is an interesting game.  It allows you to experience major scenes in the movie.  It gives instructions on what to do to move ahead, and then more scenes get unlocked.  We have only done one year of Hogwarts so far, so I guess it will keep getting better.  My only peeve is that the first year flew by so quickly - there were other scenes that they could have included."
5,I highly recommend this game.,"In my opinion this is the best game on PlayStation VR! I was nervous about this at first because I didn't think it was a good idea to be playing a game in VR for as many hours as Skyrim requires. But I don't get sick or headaches while playing this for a extended time, I do make sure I take breaks every 10 minutes tho. This game feels completely different in VR! Fighting a dragon as it circles over you just can't be described! But on the downside this is a old game! The animations do break up and glitches galore! I really wish this wasn't a full price game since it's the same game that's been rereleased almost every year! But I'm happy with the immersion and was complete worth the price!"
4,This is a really good controller. My husband loves it and it works ...,"This is a really good controller. My husband loves it and it works really well. The only con is that the colored face plate is raised up quite a bit so some of the buttons don't stick out as far as they are supposed to. It doesn't affect how the controller works, it's just a little annoying"
1,DVD games are NOT the way to go.,"Sometimes I wonder if anybody has ever bought a game released on DVD. The truth is, DVD isn't any better quality for games, it's just slower. If you have a CD-ROM drive, buy the CD-ROM version. If you only have a DVD drive  on your comp, get a CD-ROM drive. DVD drives are slower than a good 40-50x  cd-rom drive, no matter what anyone tries to tell you."
5,Good,Good!!!
4,My 8- and 10-year-olds love it,"My kids are huge Lego game fans and are near-completionists of Lego Star Wars, Batman, Indiana Jones, Harry Potter, etc. (come to think of it I need to take them out fishing more often).  Anyway, they were not disappointed when they started this up.  The voice acting is well done, the gameplay is inventive and endlessly cooperative, and replay value is huge as with all Lego games.  Their rating: as good as Lego Star Wars I and II (their most favorite games), better than Harry Potter and Indiana Jones.  In 4 hours of gameplay we have had one lock-up so far requiring power cycling of the Wii and two situations where a character or vehicle wass hopelessly trapped requiring restart of the level."
5,Exceeded expectations,"Arrived on time, well packaged and works perfect.  A refurbished console it looks and performs like brand new.  Couldn't be happier."
1,pretty but not working,"Bought this product together with a new Wii.  Thought that I can save on battery.  Well, couldn't be more wrong.  Asides being somewhat pretty, this product is no good.  I believe the main thing is that the two included batteries do not work.  One never worked, and the other can only hold a small amount of power (left in charge over night and more), which would support about 30 minutes play time.  Because I don't have other similar batteries, so I have to say I don't know if it is the charging station or the batteries.  Not worth the trouble for me to send it back.  Switch back to AA rechargeables."
5,"Exactly what we needed, great seller with excellent customer service","Good value for the money, I needed another charger for my son's Nintendo Switch; the one I initially received was defective; I was ready to order another one just because we needed it and knew it would be a hassle to return it during this time. The seller had reached out to me just to ask about my experience; I explained the situation and was sent a new one immediately. GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE which saved me some trouble and money. The charger itself is a very good one, inexpensive but not cheap."
5,Exceeded my expectations,"I wouldn't consider myself a handy man, but I didn't want to pay anybody to mount my Xbox on the wall. Command strips we're out the question so I headed to Amazon to see what was available. After reading the reviews on numerous products, I decided to go with this one.  It was very easy to set up using just a leveler and screwdriver.  The price was very appealing also the fact that all I have to do to change out my Xbox one to another console is undo the straps and reattac them to them to the new console (no drilling, screwing, etc)  I highly recommend!"
1,Horrible,Headset wouldn't turn on
5,"Nice, sleek design","I really like this case. I am a 29-year-old, female gamer. I don't care for the cases that have cartoons and characters on them. This case protects my Switch while not looking like a 12-year-old boy's case. It fits the whole system and up to 5 games. It's not a heavy-duty case, but will protect it from scratching up against other items in my bag. I would not recommend this case for a child or someone who needs the additional protection. For me, this keeps the system from being scratched up while keeping all the parts together."
2,I LIKED IT BUT.......,"I just got my eclipse II one month ago and the letters are wearing off.  So far the E, A, N,S, U ARE WORN.  When the letters wear off it is clear , so  the black is wearing off.  I thought they were lazer etched from underneath?  Well this is horrible cause the light shines up through and you can not see the letter.  I am the only one who uses the keyboard and do not abuse or over use it.  strange, because it seems well built otherwise.  The leg keeps falling off too. Personlly I would like the light to be stronger on high, but others may not care."
1,Waste of money,"Got it on March 8th, last week the right stick started drifting. Return window ended on the 9th, so I'm out 79.99 on a controller. Never had this issue before and never ever had an issue with a remote after less than 2 months. Completely bummed. Amazon is usually really good with returns, but it is a 3rd party seller. Just goes to show that often the quality of 3rd party seller items is sub par."
2,My first Karaoke game - Disapointed,"I asked ""Santa"" for this for Christmas. I'm sorry to say I'm very disappointed.  I receive this version for the Wii game. For the price for this product I'm shocked that song selection is sad. ON the Wii version of this, there is no way to upload new songs, which means there is no way to improve the song choices...EVER! The graphics are cool, venues and clothes choices and fun and entertaining, but I would have been happier with more song choices and a crappier Mii. I'm thinking about looking for another Karaoke program to console myself."
1,Game is a waste of time. Trash Game,"i dont really writing negative reviews or any reviews in general. But after playing this game for several hours, i feel obligated to let would be buyers to do your own research before buying. Im a fan of previous fall out games but this one is a a big dissapointment. I would say the worst fallout game. First, the game has lots of bugs and glitches. second, its very hard to play the game solo as it really encourages cooperative play. And the world is very bland. Looks like bethesda is just in for money grabs. If i can make zero star I would and even the game is free you still lose because the actual game really is a waste of time. Fallout 76 falls miles and miles below the great games this year such as god of war, detroit, spiderman and tomb raider. Bethesda developers need to step up your game"
5,Listen to these babys!,"This headset is amazing. The price is affordable, and I got it in 2 days with my prime membership. There is an easy plug in with adapters(great for any set up) volume controls great quality sound. I really liked that i couldnt accidentally bump the buttons. Mouth piece was crystal clear. Nothing distorted or fuzzy. Soft on my ears and  my head so I can play for a while.  There are even 4 colors to choose. This is a nice gift for any gamer. I would recommend  this for any game."
5,Would you kindly purchase this collection?,"BioShock: Infinite is my favorite game of all time. That being said, I also loved the original BioShock (I never finished BioShock 2, so I can't say how I feel about that one). Unfortunately I had these games on my old PS3 and XBox360 respectively. To have them all on one system (PS4) and remastered in 1080p, especially with the Prime discount, there was no way I could pass this up. I decided to go ahead and play through the games in order and I am certainly not disappointed so far. Even though I did play BioShock through to completion, there's a lot I've forgotten about the story. It's so well done and beautiful. I'm so glad this was released and I recommend it to everyone. The storyline on these games is fantastic."
5,My kids love these!,"We have these for a few weeks now and my girls love these for their school laptops and no problem with the plugs, very sturdy and the cord length is great. Of course they love the color changes!!"
5,"As a 43-year old woman, I'm not too proud to admit that I still have my old Gameboy Advance SP.","I'm not too proud to admit that I still have my old Gameboy Advance SP along with a few games for it. After returning to the US after living overseas for a while, I pulled my boxes out of storage and found my Gameboy amongst other items I'd long since forgotten about. To my surprise, when I flipped the switch, it actually powered on which I find amazing because the game had been in storage for at least three years. What I wasn't able to find, however, was a charging cable for it. I ordered this charger cable with relatively low expectations and was pleased to see that it came with a headphone adaptor so that anyone in close proximity isn't subjected to my Mario Brothers escapades. My package arrived sooner than I'd expected and everything works perfectly."
1,One Star,The download paper for the modern warfare remastered was blank. No code at all. Will not buy again.
1,Preordered and received TAPED and Upside down,"This was supposed to be a new item, but as you can see in the pics, it was definitely not new."
5,Love this mouse,"I read the reviews on this and I was hesitant to get it because a lot of them said they didn't get the mouse from the picture.  The one I received was exactly like the picture.  The lights on it change color every few seconds and there are a lot more colors then the picture shows.  The mouse is so comfortable to use my hand fits perfectly on it, and I don't get the hand cramps I did with my old mouse.  This was a great deal.  I would suggest it to anyone.  My only issue was the packaging, it came in a envelop wrapped in a thin layer of bubble wrap,  I was afraid it may have been damaged, but no it works great.  Oh and I love the cord... it looks and feels like a really thin rope, so it doesn't bunch like the normal black cords do.  I love it."
1,Not happy.,I played for 15 minutes and couldn't get over my frustration. I feel ripped off by EA for not allowing reviews before the game was released and I kinda want my money back for buying TS1 under a different title.
1,Awful,The low price of this collection of garbage does not dull the sting of having spent that money. The games are no better than old DOS games. Some did not even run on Windows ME. Stay away from this product.
2,Game is good if you have friends that play,"Game is good if you have friends that play, this game is unplayable solo and just gives me problems as they impose a time limit on missions even if you are going in solo? Time should be disabled if playing solo as it is nearly impossible to beat it if your just looking for a casual experience buyer beware rent before purchasing."
4,Nice New features,"This new 2007 Deluxe version of Wheel of Fortune is identical to the downloadable versions now available on MSN and Yahoo Games.  That isn't a bad thing, mind you... its just the same.  There's no annoying video clips of Vanna White to slow you down, and it is extensive in the stat keeping department as well.  Moves along fast, and the Puzzle a Day is a really nice bonus that is exclusive to this year's version."
1,Did NOT work and SPARKS!!,"I bought this cause I wanted to play my PS2 games and had misplaced the AC Adapter. I was happy when I received it but that went away really quickly because the Adapter did not work. It seemed to be very, very loose but even worse was that it began sparking. Like major sparks when it was plugged in. This product seems like a fire hazard and a danger to people. You should avoid it."
1,Couldn't get it to work!,"If I could give this product zero stars I would.  I got this for my son for his birthday.  ""Best birthday present EVER!"" he said after opening it.  Then...it didn't work.  We tried to ""calibrate the board"" for about 45 minutes...still not working.  Got online and saw that it is a huge problem with the board.  I am not willing to move all of my furniture (as others have) just to get the game to work (and many times that doesn't work either!).  I will be returning it and will never buy another Tony Hawk product.  My son is really bummed, he never even got a chance to play the game.  I have told all of my friends that bought this for Christmas - return it now before your kid goes through what mine did!!!"
5,Great Deal!!!,"I wasn't sure what to expect in terms of quality ordering something like this on amazon but I am very pleased with the controller. The shipping was super fast, and the controller works impeccably well. It has a nice feel to it, and the sticks, face buttons, and triggers are all well-made. Overall a great buy."
5,Great sound quality,Great headset! I use it with my xbox and the sound quality is great! The microphone on it works so good on it. My friends are able to hear me clearly. This was definitely a good buy.
1,Preordered in september just for them to cancel it yesterday,load of bs if you ask me
5,A hidden gem,This game isn't well know but it deserves to be. Yes there are lots of bugs in the game. Once you get passed them it's fun  and very beautiful game. ArcaniA is not fast paced game. You'll have lots of choices in mission all at the same time. You talk to people and do their favors (missions) at your own pace. In conclusion if you like non traditional RPGs this is a game for you.
1,No dlc on disk,I'm a huge fallout fan and had this on pre order since it came out. The rumors are true NO dlc on the disc just a redeem code. They way that bethesda advertised this made you think it was a special edition game but in reality it's just the core game.
2,Not as good as the original,"Let me first say I own Dragon Age: Origins on the 360 and LOVE IT! This game however is Ok but doesnt offer the flare that Dragon Are: origins offered. Immediatly when you start to play teh game you keep asking yourself, man this game is different in a weird way. I ended up buying Dragon Age: origins Ultimate Edition on Steam and playing it again and running through the premium content. Sadly Dragon Age II is gathering dust."
5,Cant wait to get drunk and rock out with my..... bros! haha,"Everything went smoothly and I was rockin out within minutes. I've had every rock band released and RB4 is just as good as the others. When I look at the new instruments next to the old ones, I can notice the better response and quality. Cant wait to get drunk with my bros and smash some drums this weekend just like old times!"
5,Yayayayaya,My speed momentum and violence  went through the roof with the two time gracing my desk.
4,A must have,Works great as intended. I was worried bc people said it's way to heavy.... Y'all got some weak pencil necks the strap actually balanced the system out perfect. Feels great.
4,There is no headline:),"It is thicker than I thought it would be, The space bar is smaller than I thought,  a small keyboards, would work for gaming but it would be just fine so not super amazing. the keys are spaced close to each other than a normal keyboard. the keys are thicker than usual"
1,Just strait booty cheeks,it wasnt comfortable nor did it sound good but it looked kinda cool.  overall just save your money for a better less cheap headset.
5,"Majesty, a Fantastic  Game","This is an amazing game. You are the king of Ardania and you must set your land right. You have the power to destroy your enemies or let them destroy you. There are many quests in which you have to accomplish goals. The  object of the game is to complete all of the quests. You can build a major  economy or relax as your heroes wipe out your enemies and die. You can  choose to have one of three types of no-human races in your kingdom. They  are the Dwarves, Elves and Gnomes. Each of them have their own abilities  and weaknesses. You control a palace and anything that you make to go with  it. You can't control your heroes. They fight whoever they want but you can  persuade them to fight who you want with bounties. You can make different  temples too. Certain temples have religous problems with others so you can  only make three at a time. If you choose the Barbarian temple you will omly  be able to have one temple. Each temple has their own spells they can cast  if in range. Besides beefing up your kingdom you can beautify it too. You  can create Royal Gardens, Statues and some buildings that appear are  Gazebos and Fountains. In addition to the area around your palace you can  build far away too. You can create Inns and Trading Posts far away which  gain money for your kingdom. Inns are also helpful because they give your  heros a place to rest. Also, inside the kingdom you can create blacksmiths  to upgrade your heroes' armor. Overall this is a fabulous game and you  should buy it."
1,I have a shotty internet connection,"I loved the original SimCity game.  I played it for hours on end.  The graphics in this new game are great.  Now if only I could play the game at my house.  But unfortunately, I have a really shotty internet connection at home.  Maybe one day EA will create a version of this game that I can play."
5,we revived the PS 2.,done deal
5,No problems with skins.,"You guys need to understand that the adhesive coating damage from the joy-cons are from a third-party seller with no idea what kind of material Nintendo used for their console. I have tested this with my console. After a few hours, I took out the skins from the joy-cons and left no coating damage whatsoever. It does take a bit pressure in getting the skins out since there left on the joy-cons after a while, but again... it didn't ruin the joy-cons. Only thing you'll see is some dust. Just wipe it down. PDPgaming is known for their strong relationship with Nintendo and tested out the skins for Nintendo's approval. If you look at their twitter or facebook accounts, they have acknowledged it. Now... as for the skins, it is beautifully done and am enjoying the detail of my customized console. As long as you buy the skins from PDPgaming and not from a third-party, then there will be no problems at all."
5,Sleek and simple,"After being very impressed with the mount I purchased for my PS4 I had to pre order the PS5 mount. The mount is sleek and sturdy, I was a bit nervous of the fit because the PS5 has a curve on the side; but it fits nice and snug with the wall. Looks great, and no PlayStation on the mantle makes my wife happy!"
2,"Not much better, but now inappropriate for kids","2nd year in a row they chose music that is only rap. This year there's a song that is literally half bleeped along with the P word that isn't even bleeped.  First year ever I've had to turn the music off altogether so that my 8 year old can be in the room.  It's amazing that Hard Knocks which is a MA show can choose football related music with no bad words even though the show allows it, but Madden can't.  Game play isn't much different and may be slightly improved.  A couple big bugs fixed, many still remain in franchise mode.  Player improvement system revamped, jury is still out on if it's better or not, but they did eliminate the ability to tweak players into somewhat unrealistic superstar status."
5,Great Fun!,This game arrived before the due date and in perfect condition.  It is a great game.  It is really fun to play!!
5,Five Stars,good product
4,Seems okay so far,Charges my switch lite
5,Fantastic,Takes a while to completely learn how to use it but it is an outstanding device.
1,Beware!  Cannot transfer VC and WiiWare games!,"Nintendo's policy is that they WILL NOT transfer games from one system to another.  If you are buying this to replace an older model just know that you will NOT be able to transfer your downloaded content (Virtual Console, WiiWare games) to this system.  You will have to start all over and pay for the same content you've already bought for a second time."
5,AMAZING CONTROLLER REPLACEMENT,This is an amazing controller replacement if you don't want to spend the hefty price for a brand new controller. This controller is wired but it also works flawlessly. The response is speedy fast and I can play different games on my ps4 flawlessly. The only thing about this controller is the touchpad. I don't expect much from the touchpad since the price is already fairly cheap. You just need to press a little harder than a regular dpad from the original ps4 controller. Amazing controller and I will definitely be using this more often even during fast-paced game play.
1,"Broken, defective, faulty, shoddy",This game is chock full of crash bugs and doesn't even run well on a powerful system. Stick to the console versions.
5,Great Entertainment Value,"This game is so much better than Brain Age, which I got tired of within the first couple of weeks.  This game continues to keep me entertained with a great number and variety of games, as well as the ability to keep unlocking new ones to add to the  mix.  I also like the different categories of Stress Testing vs. Brain Testing, it just doubles the amount of games that there are to play.  This game is really fun, I have a hard time putting it down!"
5,Give it a week. Disable the sniper button at first.,"So I loved the Logitech G9. When it died I went with a wireless G602. The 602 was okay but not the greatest for my grip. I guess I'm a claw grip to finger grip type mouse user. So I looked up what was the best, the M65 seemed to be that mouse. I get it and hook it up and instantly hated the shit out of this thing. Why would they put this stupid button on the side. Eh God why. I go into the software which makes very little sense and disable the button, setup my colors and adjusted my DPIs. The first day playing with this thing I was pretty sure I was sending it back, the button screwed up everything. But I kept on, it was 40 bucks...I'll give it a few days. By the second day I got use to putting my thumb between the sniper button and the thumb buttons. Then by the third day I was completely use to the mouse and rarely smacked the sniper button. So now I've had it 2 weeks and turned the sniper button back on. It's really useful to be honest. My big problem with the G602 was I would hit the thumb buttons on accident all the time. This one I rarely do, if ever. And I have the DPI on the sniper button to be just slightly lower anyway, plus it's push to use, not toggle. My only complaint is that the middle mouse button is a bit heavy to hold down. I play Siege and when using someone who requires a constant press for the ability it can get heavy, but I guess I could re-assign it. Besides that I love the mouse."
1,Beware of major technical problem with Wii U,"My review is based on the fact I have not been able to play the game due to a faulty console.  I purchased a Wii U for my kids and gave it to them as an early Christmas present.  Took it out, spent a lot of time setting up, took down the old Wii, just to have it not work.  Tried 2 brand new Wii U games, Super Mario and Madden.  Kept getting invalid disk error.  I googled the problem to see if others were experiencing the same problem so I could figure out what i did wrong in set up. What I found is a LONG thread of people of experienced the same problem and that it is problem with the console - many of the consoles being sold by Nintendo have a bad optical reader and Nintendo's solution is to have you package it up and send it back for repair.  I am shocked that Nintendo would continue to put units out for sale KNOWING this is a common problem with the unit.  God forbid they cut down their inventory during the Christmas season and hurt sales.  Better to have a lot of frustrated parents and disappointed kids.  Shame on you Nintendo!"
5,Perfect addition to our Wii,We found an old Wii and needed something for the kids to do for the summer since Covid.  This have been a great addition to our console.  The colors are bright and synced easily to our system.
5,Fast console with excellent graphics!,I bought this for my nephew for Christmas to upgrade from his current X Box One console. He had me watch him play and I can honestly say that I even notice the increase in speed and the better graphics on this console. The download speeds for games are also much faster than on his X Box One!  He loves it so far!
5,Need USB cables for your PS3. Ta Da,"So, yes, I still use my PS3. It has the mini-usb outlets that no one uses any more. I needed two cables for charging and these are just right. The cables are solid and for me the 10 ft length is just right. They're USB cables, they're 10 feet long, they work as advertised and the price was good."
5,PS Trollboys,"Most of the 1 stars arent even verified purchase, meanwhile for playstation 4 there are 1 star verified purchases all over. Dont believe me? Goo look for yourself."
1,Horrible game - don't buy.,"Bought this on a whim, big mistake.  The game play is extremely limited, and made me feel like I was playing a game out of the 90's.  You really can only go one way through the game, so if you just keep clicking you'll make it through.  But the reasons I'm writing the review and returning the game are two-fold... The text comes out of order - characters refer to other characters that you've supposedly already met when you haven't, and, the entire game finally crashed on me.  It got into a loop while questioning a character and it would keep cycling and finally locking up.  Definitely a bad experience all around."
5,Best Casual Switch Game,"I've sunk a ton of hours into this game and I have no regrets! By far the best casual pick up and play game on the Switch and is one I would definitely recommend. Only complaint is that I am currently on my sixth in game year and it's starting to get a little monotonous after having collected all the artifacts, married several the in villages, conquered the mines, popped out 2 kids, made millions off of melons and have barns full of  fat and happy animals. That being said, each one of these things was an amazing challenge I prided myself in completing."
5,In love!,"I used several parts to complete this swap. Instead of buying a broken ps4 controller, it was far more easy going this route. The main reason for this purchase was to get the black out D pad along with the Share and Start button. Im happy with how it turned out."
5,"Just like the real thing, only cheaper",Works as good as the crazy-expensive Nintendo version.  Stands up to a 5 and 7 year old for several hours a week without a problem.  Why pay more?
1,Complete let down,This game is a HUGE let down.  It is awful and in no way is an improvement on the first Saint's Row.  That's probably why there was not a big PR event on the release of this game.  Do NOT waste your money buying this game!
5,"Drool... So good, buy quickly","I have waited for this game for years. Although Red and Blue were the same in most aspects and Yellow was just a minor upgrade, Gold and Silver are in  a whole new level of Pokemon. With the internal clock that tells the real  time and date means that you just might have to drop some activites on  Tuesday to make it in time for the tornament (Yes, in the game) You may now  have to balance out your life between Pokemon and real life bothersome  activities (Like eating,sleeping, breathing and buying batteries) The 251  pokemon give me the same feeling of wonder when I was first playing  Blue.(Wow! What's this, a sandshrew. Oh cool, a new town) The new types of  pokemon include steel and dark pokemon (Yes rejoice all you evil  Mewtwo-Gyrados loving fans)To ease the pain of waiting that you have  endured, here's some thing's to do while you are waiting: 1. Make the  decision between Gold or Silver 2. Choose if you want Totodile, Chorita, or  Cynaquil 3. Map out which pokemon you think you should trade to Gold (I  wonder if what that trader with the electrode on Cinnabar Island said will  make any sense... 4. Choose your 2nd in Command pokemon (not your starting  pokemon) 5. Select breeding pairs of pokemon  6. Take big deep breaths"
5,"An untapped gaming experience, completely awestruck","NEVER has a game affected me this way. So visceral and visually stunning - along with an absolutely compelling story weaving mythology, adventure, horror, and the flailing attempts to balance a mind teetering on the edge of insanity....This GOTY stuff...VERY Impressed"
1,"Only for game chat, not for game audio...",Doesn't play game audio so what is the point.
1,Banged up box,Busted up box. Don't buy on Amazon if you expect a nice box to display. Game play has been good so far.
5,"Packaged and shipped well, dreadfully boring game.","Everything came well and quick, but a boring game. Played about an hours worth and didn't touch it again."
1,Beware: Internet Required,Would have been very helpful if it was stated that this game requires internet to download the final episode since I live in a rural area where internet isn't available. Loved the first Life is Strange and was really looking forward to this one.
1,What PS5?,Still waiting months and months later to buy one. Still none.
4,Pretty good controller overall but really poor battery life,"These controllers are pretty cheap but they work decently and they feel pretty good as well, the thing that really sucks about them is how poor their battery life is. A long gaming session into a day this thing might not actually last through, if you plan on using this controller for long periods of time are you forget to plug it in at night you're going to have to use a battery pack charger or some such to give it power. Comparing this to another Bluetooth wireless controller that I have, such as the Wii U Pro controller, it is pathetic. The Wii U pro controllers battery life is about 80 hours which is insane well this controllers battery life is maybe 8 hours."
5,"Good console, great bundle!","I held out until now to get the PS4 - I've been mainly using my PS3 as a media center, but have loved the playing previous Uncharted games as well as Last of Us on it.  I'm quite pleased at the upgrade to PS4, and Uncharted 4 is AMAZING.  More importantly for me, at this price the bundle feels like a great value.  I'd say that if you've been wanting a PS4 but holding out, now is a great time to get it!"
1,Won't work for Windows 7,"We tried and tried but it does not work for Windows 7.  My computer is new, the disk was new, but after installation, it totally didn't work.  It says right on the disk good for Windows 7.  No, did not work."
5,Amazing,Hands down the most realistic boxing game ever made. The online play is smooth and not laggy like Fight Night Round 4. The campaign mode is brilliant and the amount of great boxers that they have is impressive. I have been a fan of Fight Night since it was known as knockout kings and this is the best boxing game I ever played. I highly recommend it.
5,It's a flying sim - not a game,If you run out and get this program thinking your getting a game your wrong. This is a flight Simulator and that is what you get. If your a pilot or an aspiring pilot and want to get some practice flying or try out what it takes to fly an aircraft this is a good way to find out. I've run this program on my PIII 1.1 GHZ WIN-XP laptop with 512 MB ram and 32 MB graphics card as well as a Celeron 1.2 GHz 256 MB ram and integrated 11 MB graphics and it has performed well on both systems. Have even flown between the two systems over my home lan with great ease. This program is much better with a flight stick and is rather difficult to attempt with a keyboard. I use a MS Sidewinder force feedback 2 stick and it works great. Program is a hard drive hog on full install though using up 1.7 Gig per system. Thankfully Microsoft does not make you have a CD in the computer to run the program so you don't need to have the software handy after install. Overall I think it's the best SIM out there. If your looking for a game look at Combat Flight Simulator 2 or some other shoot-em up game.
1,Horrible DRM scheme,"You have to maintain a constant connection to their servers or it kicks you out of the game.  Hope you didn't want to play it on your day off, their servers are having issues...."
4,The only reason I am giving them 4 stars is ...,The only reason I am giving them 4 stars is because when I opened the box the printed cardboard skylanders was missing from the package.  It was no issue because I am giving this to my Godson and hes not a collector an will actually play with pieces inside and all of them were there.  Caution only if I was a collector and didn't want to ever open the package then I would have sent it back.
5,Great game,My 4 year old loves this game! I bought it a little unsure how she would like it but it was perfect for her.
5,RE7 is a must buy!,"This game is amazing. Not like any other Resident Evil, yet it goes back to their roots at the same time. It's different but in a good way, not different in a bad way like 5 and 6. I've already ran through the campaign 10 times and love it every time. I play on xbox so I'll have to wait another week or so for the DLC, which is already out on PS4. But for anyone on the fence about buying RE7 I highly recommend you give it a chance. I think Resident Evil fans will be pleasantly surprised. This game is exactly what this franchise needed. I usually hate sequels but if they keep this up with RE8 I would be just fine with that."
1,Do not buy if your are planning game only in portable mode,I was so happy when PST was released on Switch. Unfortunately text on console screen is absolutely unreadable. Do not buy if you are planning to play only in portable mode like me. Will play PST EE on my PC instead
1,your best bet is ordering directly from Logitech,"DO NOT BUY THIS MOUSE FROM AMAZON. I have had two already, both of which were obviously used before (broken seal on the box, scuffs on the mouse itself). If you want an actual NEW mouse, your best bet is ordering directly from Logitech."
1,Did not work,"Didnt work, contacted seller, no response. Wasted my money, dont waste yours."
5,The other reviews with images lack a brain or basic reading knowledge.,"I'm going to say this with peer honesty. This fits perfect. The other reviews just didn't read the description. My headset with elite strap fits perfectly. It has room to fit an external battery inside, and a little bag to store my money in. Most the images you see are after market straps which are quite bulky. If you get an official elite strap it will fit in this bag. Only questionable thing is. Why a micro USB female input? The headset is usb c. That's about it. That can honestly be ignored and not be a big deal at all."
5,Cool vertical stand for PS4!,"I love this vertical stand and the fact that it not only holds the PS4 in a vertical position very securely, but it will also charge two controllers, and has a fan to keep the PS4 from overheating.  I didn't have a problem with that to begin with, but I like having the extra fans just in case that ever does become an issue.  The stand is made well and looks cool!  I like the blue lights that come on when the whole system is powered up.  My only issue is that I can't see the lights from the controller when they're plugged in confirming that they are charging, but I know that they are charged because the battery indicator when I use them shows to be fully charged.  All in all a cool stand, and a good price.  I would recommend."
5,I use this every day!,"I love this mouse so much. I was a little nervous when a lot of reviews said it was crap but for me, it has been amazing! The battery lasts probably almost a week and the silent click is so awesome that I now have problems using them because of how loud they seem in comparison. The wireless is so undescribably convenient! There are two buttons on the side and I have no idea what the front one does but the back one is auto run in World of Warcraft. There is also a weird button on the top behind the scroll that is a bit hard to push. No idea what that is. But for me, this mouse has been really awesome. Just some tips, sometimes one of the clicks gets stuck up, just (carefully, mind you) push it back down. Also, at first I thought the plug-in piece was missing but just look in the bottom at that kind of bar thing near the palm of the hand."
5,A must have,"The hype behind this game is well worth it.  This is a must have collection for any basketball fan.  The graphic in the game is outstanding and the AI and game play is unbelievable.  The players grunt when they take a difficult shot or take a charge.  You have to be careful with your passes because the computer is playing for real and picking off lazy passes.  Yes, they hyped the game with the return of Jordan, but it is not only Jordan that is in the game.  Malone, Stockton, Pipen, Rodman etc. are all in the game.  There are players in the game that we all forgot i.e. Bill Wellington with the Bulls.  The commentators does a great job with the play-by-play calling and it is bring back memories listening to them talk during the game about when Jordan had the flu.  They got all the drama surrounding that correct.  I did find a bug in the game.  Near the end of the game while, shooting free throws my coach Phil Jackson walked on the floor and stood in the lane. It does take time getting use to play of the game because the defense is much tougher as in previous games.  The Jordan challenges is not easy."
1,Eh,Doesn't beat skyrim
5,Solitary Wargamer's Delight,"Not so long ago, hex-based wargamers faced daunting challenges including set-up time, playing space and quality opponents.  These challenges forced most of us as adults to shelve our passion, content with the memories of high school and college ""gamer clubs.""  Fortunately, thanks to the dedication of tireless developers, we can now trade our cardboard counters for the lure of a glowing screen.  Korsun Pocket takes full advantage of today's robust software and architecture to create a hobbyist's dream: a robust, on demand, historically accurate gaming experience.  If you have a wargaming background, Korsun Pocket's intuitive gameplay allows you to learn as you go.  As you improve, the game offers a full range of options to help adjust for historical odds, player ability and ""what if"" scenarios.  Korsun Pocket includes a campaign game; a handful of shorter, related scenarios and a bonus campaign centering on Hitler's desperate campaign in the Ardennes.  Whether you choose to play as the Axis, Russians or Americans, this delightful PC wargame presents an elegant gift to the faithful among us."
5,"Great game, but new players may need extra help","I am really enjoying Disgaea 1. I am new to the series and I was worried I was not going to like the combat. However, I found that it was fast and enjoyable. If you are not new to JRPG but, new to the Disgaea like I am I think you will enjoy it. But, if you never played a JRPG but, you are still interested in Disgaea 1 I recommend finding a good walkthrough online, to help you navigate the different systems in the game because it can be a little overwhelming. But, if you are willing to learn and okay with the grinding in JRPGs, and a story and characters that don't take themselves too seriously then Disgaea 1 could be the game for you."
5,The best Vita,I wanted this Vita because I don't like the plain black ones America has. This Japanese import DOES play American games and the color is beautiful. You can change the language and set up the content manager very easily. I like how light-weight this second gen Vita is after using it for awhile and the feel of the rounded buttons is very nice. I love this Vita and I plan on playing it very often.
5,Best case hands down for switch games!,"This case is seriously amazing!  So glad that I bought it, the only down side is that it is one sided. Wish there was an option to purchase with the inserts on both sides. Either way WELL worth my money!!!  I ended up ordering 2, one for home and one for the road. Best and easiest decision I ever made. It is about the size of a comic book (bigger than the switch game boxes and a hard DVD case). Must have for any gamer saving on space while protecting your games!"
5,"Many of the games on here are awesome, I would recommend starting with Banjo Kazooie","Many of the games on here are awesome, I would recommend starting with Banjo Kazooie, Banjo Tooie, and Conker's Bad Fur Day. This collection is worth it for those games alone, not to mention the 27 many of which are also fantastic. Also if you're in the mood to throw a controller at a wall I would strongly recommend Battletoads."
1,"Sometime cheap is good but, not in this case!","Super cheap so I thought I'd give them a try. They looked ok and that was about all they had going for them. Sound quality was terrible no matter what adjustments I made, according to gaming buddies the mic sounded muffled and they had to turn me up to max in teamspeak to even hear me at all, the ear covers were plastic and didn't breathe., so after about 20 minutes my ears were sweating and behind my ears started getting irritated. I didn't even bother to put them away in case i should need a backup, I just threw them out."
2,Not as fun as I expected....,"After reading all the other reviews, I expected a great game.  I have to admit, the last Sonic game I played was the Genesis one.  Maybe the franchise has gone other places, but I personally just didn't like playing this game.  Specifically, my biggest problem was not being able to see the levels very well.  The colors are very muted and often have little contrast.  One of the things I love about most other DS games (the new Super Mario Brothers, for example) is how vibrant and easy on the eyes the levels are.  With this game, Sonic (or Blaze), along with the path you are running on, seems to blend into the background.  That might be fine for some games, but when a game's emphasis is on speed and rapidly moving through the levels, there needs to be better visual cues.  Just my 2 cents."
5,An Collector's Edition Worthy of An Saiyan!,"Amazing game and Collector's Edition! First off it does NOT come with the season pass! It was pointed out in the comments it does not include the season pass, it NEVER said it included the season pass in the item description section. But I feel the need to inform folks it doesn't include it. You can purchase the season pass separately at your local video game store (like I did). Anyway, the game Dragonball Xenoverse 2 is amazing! It's the best DBZ game to date! The combos are wild and brutal! The controls are excellent and responsive. The graphics are improved! I'm loving everything about the game! The steelbook is made up of high quality metal. I haven't gotten around to listening to the soundtrack yet, or the guide it comes with. Last but not least the amazing Super Saiyan Goku figure! It's over 13 inches tall and made with high quality material! The attention to detail is flawless! This figure is an must have for DBZ collectors! It's an all around nice purchase!"
5,Great game and I got all my content,Was delivered in good condition. The pre-order dlc was messaged to me later and I have been enjoying this title a lot
1,DOA,It was dead on arrival. Cant get anything but blue flashing light. I tried all the different fixes with no success.
1,Glitchy Poorly Written Game,"Been playing COD from the very beginning and I have to say that CODWW2 is by far the worst playing of the franchise.  I am playing on an Quad I7 with a middle of the road NVIDA card, system optimized for game play, via a fiber optic Gigabit connection.  The game stumbles and glitches, rarely get the drop on the opponent, always lose in a toe to toe battle.  I have played enough to have a true feel for when the software is not performing correctly.  Don't waste your time with this one...pass it up."
5,Awesome!,"Keyboard came in, looks exactly as described. The best part about this keyboard is the way the keys feel, it almost feels like grip-tape on a skateboard and feels very unique. I have a Mac with Windows 10 dual booted and it works perfect on both."
1,Right click doesn't hold. Keeps double clicking,"Purchased this mouse on July 2nd and as of the day of this review the mouse went from being a 5 to a 1. I really expected so much more out of Logitech and incredibly upset that in less then a month the mouse is already giving me issues. I purchased this mouse to replace my old razer deathadder which lasted me for approximately 3 years. I figured since I already owned the G402 that it would make sense to upgrade to a G502 and give it a shot with the weights feature. The weights were pretty nice and helped in a way, but what makes me give this mouse a 1 rating is the right click problem that so many people complained about. So when I play Overwatch I play A LOT of widow and recently the right click would always double click as I'm sitting there scoped in. It happened so frequently that I can't even play the game properly. So if you're looking for a game that you need to scope STAY AWAY. The double clicking is truly a problem and I decided to risk purchasing this mouse even after seeing so many complain about it in the reviews. So again, if you need to hold your clicks, keep searching for another mouse.  Shame on you Logitech :("
2,Tracking is crap.  Game is good.,"The calibration is pathetic for Nintendo in 2019.  It's far too frustrating to use.  The content in the game is great, but it's an exercise in patience more than a physical workout.  You can reset position and try different controllers all day, but it still doesn't know which way is up for more than a few moments.  There's no gyro calibration in the menu despite Nintendo's help documentation."
1,COMPLETELY DAMAGED BOX AND PLASTIC,"I bought this item as a gift, the first thing I noticed when unboxing was the cracked plastic holding the funko pop up inside the box, this is absolutely ridiculous considering NOTHING WAS DISCLOSED OF THIS in the description. When you buy a funko pop of this tier, you expect any flaws to be made known, which is not the case at all. Absolutely waste of money."
5,awesome and awesome!,awesome and awesome!  We all love it - great new features and looking forward to the next gen games to come.
5,Amazingly fun,"I remember back in the day when a little game called ""Stunts"" occupied hours of me and my friends' time.  This game captures all the pure fun of that game and adds an slick, modern-day presentation on top of it (graphics are wonderful).  The driving model is absolutely perfect for this type of game.  You can steer, brake, and even accelerate while airborne, which makes executing precision jumps a sight to behold (and a joy to perform).  In a day were most of the fifty dollar games I buy end up gathering dust before I feel I've obtained half of what I invested, it is a great joy to pickup a value priced game like TrackMania that just keeps me coming back for more.  This is the ultimate game to have on your computer when you simply don't feel like investing hours on your favorite MMO, or the precision required to play Gran Turismo.  Download the demo, and then I'll see you back here when you are posting how much fun this game is :)"
1,No co-op split screen,"No co-op split screen, this is the nail in the coffin Microsoft. I already switched all my computers this year to macs after the windows 10 forced update.  Great looking game but since I can't play with friends and family (the only reason I bought the game) it's going to sit on the shelf."
2,Bad Song Choices,I must agree with the other reviews. This is full of songs I didn't even know where in the movies. I have always been a Disney fan and they have so many great songs that are not on this game. The sound is also very quiet and hard to hear while you are trying to sing.
5,Almost like the Real Thing!!!,"I had a Mad Catz Wheel with my PS1 and only a child would have thought it was like driving a real car. BUT with PS2 it's a whole differnt story. Just plug in the electrical cord for the Logitech Force Feedback Wheel (YES, it's electrified) connect it to your PS2 and get ready for the closest thing to a real car without leaving your couch. This wheel doesn't just SHAKE it actually RESPONDS to the imaginary road and many a time you will have to fight the wheel and the laws of inertia to maintain control of your car, especially at high speeds (talk about realistic). On Rallye courses you can feel the gravel beneath the tyres and the slight jolt of a wheel bounce. Super Speedways have a tendency to pull your car to the outside (due to your high speed) and you'll be fightin' the wheel alot. With F1 2000 you can calibrate the Wheel for precise handling of the G.P. Circuits (you'll feel like Michael Schumacher winding your way around the course). I liked this wheel so much I bought a 2nd one!"
5,This game is seriously fun.,"Very realistic and very hard, if you're looking for an easy game don't buy this. But the storytelling is amazing and I really enjoy the fighting, just took a while to get the hang of it."
2,"Want total frustration, buy this game.","This is the worst of the series.  Lets see, cannot make Quick Saves sometimes, check points are so far and few between that when you die, and you will, you get sent back 30 minutes.  Very sparse resources, you will run out of ammo all the time."
1,overpriced for used,why would i pay almost 500 dollars for a used switch when i can go to nintendo's website and buy it brand new for 300
5,This is wickedly fun...,I was reading through Game Informer and I'm not understanding why this game got a mediocre review. This is one of the coolest games I've bought in a long time. The graphics are great. The story is fun. The knife you get is useful for attacks but the pepper grinder is an excellent weapon. If you are thinking of buying this game I would say go for it and ignore the reviews. In fact I'm going to ignore the reviews period from now on. I would have missed out on a great game if I would have listened to them..
5,"Glad to have it, but you MAY want to wait.","As someone who likes to have the ""New Shiny"" as early as possible, I was very pleased that my PS5 arrived on release day! I have had a blast with it so far! Demon's Souls is a brilliant launch title, recapturing and improving upon the 2009 PS3 title. Miles Morales continues the magic from 2018's Spider-Man, in a shorter, but more focused campaign. But shockingly, the bundled-in Astro's Playroom is probably the most fun I have had with my new console! It oozes fun and charm and is simultaneously a love letter to all thing Playstation and also a thorough showcase of what the DualSense controller is capable of! For me, this purchase hit all the right notes, but I could definitely say that a large portion of gamers can probably wait to get one until there are a few more exlusives!"
5,Superb realism and graphics,I have followed the Falcon 4 saga for a number of years. After much weeping and gnashing of teeth the user groups and the manufacturer have gotten together to produce this masterpiece. It needs a beefy system to keep up with the graphics potential without losing framerates but it's worth it. Astonishing in every detail.
1,CODE DOES NOT WORK,The code does not work in origin.... I cannot find help or a way to get my money back!!!!
5,"Stunning visuals, great story","This is probably one of the most pleasing games I have ever played. There is enough variety you will keep playing, and the story will keep you engaged beyond the gameplay and some of the best visuals I have ever seen in a game, period. The landscapes are breathtaking. Makes me want to visit Japan."
5,The Greatest RE Of Them All!!!!!!!!!!!,"What can I say this is without question the greatest RE in the series!!!!! The graphics, gameplay, everything is right on ""Q"" for what a PS2 game should be. I will be honest and say that the Gamecube version is graphically superior to the PS2 version but who the hell cares?!!!!! The only thing that really truly matters is the fact that this gem has finally been released to the PS2. Those of us who hung tight with sony and didn't jump ship just for this game after it was announced for the GC can finally rejoice in the glory that is the first definitive sequel since the Code Veronica release almost seven years ago. a rather lenghty dry spell from capcom. Not with standing the disaster that was OutBreak. The weapons are awesome in this game with very nice updates to the sniper rifle, mine thrower, and rocket launcher. The game is in a way a slight turn by capcom in terms of there are'nt as many puzzles to solve. Which is something this franchise has always had a considerable emphasis on. This is just pure adrenaline, Lay the smackdown on their candy asses jaw dropping fun!!!! I in a way kind of felt by my first impression that this was kind of castlevanyia meets RE in a way. You know being in that dark far away land surrounded by hostile locals. The only thing I really have to gripe about is the loss of the auto aim feature. But other than that this game is flawless for a PS2 RE game. Replay value is awesome consiering that there is an exclusive side adventure only available to the PS2. In addition to the Assignment ada minigame there is a lenghtier mini game called Separate ways where you get to cover more or less the same ground as leon, but through ada's perspective. You also have the option of starting a new game after you clear it the first time, and when you replay you can start the new game with everything you had in the end of the last game. Bottom line is if you already played this for the gamecube then you ain't missing a whole lot.  The premium edition is definitley a must have for the die hard RE fan.  For only 10 dollars more you get a limited edition laser cell artwork of Ada Wong Limited to only 60,000, and each has a certificate of authenticity and is individually serialized.  You also get a exclusive prologue booklet that kind of chronicles the stories and gives a little synopsys of each RE going back to the first one that kind of adds to the story a little, and finally you get a making of RE 4 DVD with the package as well.  Bottom line is: if you are a die hard PS2 fan that hasn't had the opportunity to play this game until just now all I can say is get it get it get it get it NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You will not be disapointed!"
5,Perfect,This is EXACTLY as I'd hoped and just what I was looking for. Originally bought a different case but wasn't satisfied...grips weren't easy enough to grip and didn't dock. This one docks easily (NOT too tight) and the grips make the switch much easier to use. I think the ones that think the dock is too tight are probably sliding it in backwards or something?
5,Good bundle,my old arcade system finally gave out after 5 years no red ring so i got this instead its pretty nice and works great its got wifi built in and its very quiet!
1,Not on time,Pokemon i love you. But late...i waited all day for this game nothing now i have to wait and hope it comes tomorrow
5,Very Pretty,This keyboard is soooo cute. It works really well and the sound of the keys are very satisfying. If you have a pink aesthetic or you like the color pink this keyboard is perfect! The lighting is really nice and the brightness is adjustable. There are also different light settings.
2,Another crappy Assassin Creed game.,"In true Assassin Creed form. It is garbage.  Assassin creed 4 black flag is the only 4 star game, as long as you stay on the boat."
1,Gets in the way of the buttons!,"I was very excited to see the NFL faceplates made for the PS3 but very disappointed in the way this fit over the controller.  Installation is very easy as it just snaps on the pad. Once the faceplate is snapped on, it covers the spaces between the circle, square, triangle and X buttons as well as the D-pad leaving it very difficult to push the buttons down.  Having this faceplate on the control pad makes it very uncomfortable and a hassle when playing a game.  I have already sent mine back to Amazon."
4,One of the best,This is quite possibly one of the best Nancy Drew PC games we've ever played.  We've played each one (a group of 4 of us) and enjoy the ND games since they're family friendly.  This one is especially enjoyable because of the challenging puzzles and we found the subject matter very interesting.  The graphics are getting better with each game.  Out of the 17 ND games to date this one is my personal favorite (and we're only half way through the game!!)
5,Very good replacement,Our original remote got stepped on and broken. This has definitely been a good replacement!! None of the kids have complained!!! I certainly plan on keeping this brand in my wish list for future purchases.
5,Excelente producto.,"Es un producto original, no hemos presentado ningún inconveniente en su funcionamiento."
2,"The sound was okay but not great, the microphone is a huge highlight of the ...","Buyer beware, only designed for people with a particular head. Not very forgiving to people who have medium sized head or larger. small ear cups that smash your ears and non adjustable frame only some silly elastic strap. The sound was okay but not great, the microphone is a huge highlight of the headset though it was great."
4,"... one died and i must say this is a awesome headset, the only reason i cant give it ...","I ordered this headset after my old one died and i must say this is a awesome headset, the only reason i cant give it 5 stars is because i have large ears and the drivers on this headset are a bit too small for me plus i have 1 inch gauges in my ears so if you have large ears or large gauges i don't know if i would buy them but if you don't then these bad boys are rock solid. I'll def be looking into buying a different pair of Astros in the future."
1,Isn't Working On Switch,Didn't connect to Switch no matter what method I tried. Useless.
5,This so much better than having your controllers plugged in with a cord ...,"This so much better than having your controllers plugged in with a cord dangling all over the place and falling on the floor. Controllers sit snug, it looks nice. It appears that it stops charging once the controllers are fully charged, the little lights in front go off."
5,Five Stars,my son loves it
4,Interactive and engagin,My 9 year old like it so far. It's not very intuitive and my daughter is struggling through it but at least it's challenging.
5,Game review,"This game is just about as fun as the original Pokemon Stadium.  It has the four cups: Pika, Petit, Poke, and Prime from the first Pokemon Stadium as well as four new ones.  The cups each contain a variety of Pokemon trainers you have to defeat.  You can upload your own Pokemon from Red, Blue, Yellow, Gold, or Silver and pit them against the other trainers in the Stadium Cups Mode.  Some cups have one full tournament of eight trainers total.  Each time you beat a trainer, you get a badge.  The badges don't pertain to their Gym type though.  Other cups have four Ball tournaments: Poke Ball, Great Ball, Ultra Ball, and Master Ball.  Each Ball tournament has eight trainers making the total number of trainers in that Cup 32 trainers.  This mode is single player.  There is also a mode called Gym Leader Castle where you can face the Gym Leaders from the Game Boy games.  You first face the eight Johto Gym Leaders from Gold and Silver. Then you face the Elite Four and Lance.  Then you move on to facing the eight Kanto trainers from Gold and Silver.  The Kanto Gym Leaders are the leaders featured in Pokemon Red, Blue, and Yellow but in GS, they are stronger trainers.  After that, you move on to facing the strongest trainer from Gold and Silver: Red who was Ash and the player you controlled in the Red, Blue, and Yellow versions.  This mode is also single player.  Don't have Pokemon from your Game Boy game?  Pokemon Stadium 2 has Pokemon that you can rent and a whole lot more stuff.  Have fun!"
1,Waste,No game only a code!!
5,Love at first touch.,"I love this keyboard for a gaming keyboard, fell in love with it as soon as I got it!"
1,Cop Killing on a lego game...are you kidding me?,"My kids think this game is really fun, but I was incredibly upset when I saw them playing as villains and killing cops. I find that completely unacceptable. Just thought parents should know..."
5,Awesome stick it has a touchpad!!!!,I love The fightstick i love yhe hayabusa lever it has but i changed the ball top. Also i had no problem with the kuro buttons but i just wanted different colored sanwa buttons. Best alternative to te2 especially since its cheaper.
5,Who Knew That Oblivion Could be Fun,"This game is amazing. It delivers on all levels for me and is a leap ahead from Morrowind. I could go into detail about the graphics or A.I. but by now most of us have seen videos exemplifying these things, the real beauty in Oblivion comes with behind the scenes improvements. The biggest of these for me is real time physics. Now when I crush somebody sideways with my mace they lift off the ground and follow the arc of my blow, and proceed to land in the appropriate way a real body would. Any item that is equipped in their hand does not drop with the body and becomes its own item following the force of the blow as well but on its own. The first time I hurled a fireball past its intended target it slammed into a table cluttered with stuff and everything flew. As for the problems alluded to by others about button mapping issues there are plenty of hotkeys and quick menu buttons so it is really a non-issue. Also I want to say that I love the collector's edition if for nothing more than the pocket guide to the empire. However I love flavor text and was one of those guys who spent more time reading his magic cards than playing with them. All in all great game by my count and I would encourage others to give it a try."
4,good,"this is an awesome controller. I got this for my son. his old controller broke so I got him this. When we got it, it was nicely packaged and not damaged. when he first used it he loved it. He said it felt really good. the grips worked and it worked with his pc. overall this is a good controller to get for a present or just to use. I would recommend this product."
5,Republics? Oh yeah!!!,"I bought Republics DLC, and I love it!!!! As a very rich republic of Italian wiseguys, I made a nice indent into history. By attacking local rulers, I was able to establish trading ports in many regions, competed with rival Republics for the almighty dollar, and whacked a few cousins to get some money from them. I really love this expansion!! While it isn't a completely new game, the neat money focused experiance is pretty cool. You have to finance a family business, so you gotta be rolling in dough to compete with the other Doges. If you are to buy any expansion and expect a different focal point, get this expansion. It doesn't open half the world up to you like the Sword of Islam did, but it's a good deal. Bottom line, it's a great buy and will keep you occupied for a while. Original game required to play. Steam required as well. If you didn't enjoy the original game, you'll most likely not be throwing a party over this, but for everyone else, go for it!!"
2,Not a true couch co-op game,"Buyer beware, while the game says it is a co-op multiplayer game the main storyline is anything but.  All the 2nd player can do is control a corset that can collect things and stun enemies but even that functionality does not work very well.  Controls are extremely sensitive for 2nd player and anytime the camera moves they have to try and compensate but that doesn't work well.  Very disappointing!!"
5,Fun game with tonsa new innovations,"This game, to put it bluntly, is a combination of Mario, Animal Crossing, and a coloring book.  This is the coloring book part.  It is really fun because you get to draw your own hero and a lot of times in your adventure draw like a cloud to get across a gap.  you get to draw with pixel-by-pixel drawing if you want and if you do you can just use a template or make your own which is quite hard in the scope of things.  This is wher the Mario part comes in.  You have to go in to 4 separate gates which represent 4 different realms.  You go through side scrolling adventures which are excruciatingly long.  You run, jump and ground pound just like in mario.  Fun sidecrolling with boss battles at the end of every realm. This is the animal crossing part.  You also can monitor the population of your town.  You have to draw certain things like a nice sign for a restaurant and the town crop.  Every time you complete a level you will have rescued 3 people, which will get added to your population.  Overall this is one AWESOME game.  I recommend it to anyone that likes mario and stuff like that."
5,Unreal,This game is absolutely crazy. Love the new animations and feel of the game. Even joker is going to be in it! What else can we ask for
1,DOES NOT INCLUDE CORDS DESPITE DESCRPTION SAYING CORDS ARE INCLUDED!!,Very disappointed. Game cube was without av and power cords. Description of device clearly says it comes with these things but my invoice says it is only consol. This would have been okay if I had expected to purchase these myself but the deceitful marketing has prevented me from enjoying this gamecube.
1,Product was defective upon arrival,"Dont Buy! For some reason I'm having to write another review because the original one I posted seemed to some how dissapeare. The microSD simply did not work. I continously got an error telling me to restart my switch and reinsert the SD card but it didn't work. I then used a a different microSD card I had laying around which worked perfectly with my switch. When I instered this microSD into my computer it wouldn't even detect it! The most frustrating part was the 10-15 minutes speaking to a SanDisk representative. After using the technical support rep with amazon, they were able to patch me through to a tech with SanDisk. After going over a some trouble shooting steals the rep determined the microSD card was defective. She asked for my email and number so she could email me instructions on how to send this one back and get a new replacement. I know got an email or any further instructions on how to replace the defective product I got from SanDisk. Ultimately I decided it was not worth the hassle and returned the item to Amazon for a full refund."
5,PEACE AND QUIET AT LAST!,"Our son would walk around the house playing his Nintendo Switch all the time with the volume all the way up and when you have to work from home it drives you insane.  I finally decided to find a bluetooth adapter that he could attach to his Switch and use his headphone.  I am so happy, my wife is so happy, even the dog is wagging his tail again.  I tested the product and did not find any lag on the sound.  I can go pretty far and still have connection.  After about an hour of playing with it I did not find any interruptions with this adapter.  It works great.  I would greatly recommend this bluetooth adapter.  I tested it with the USB adapter it came with on my grandmothers pc and it works great as well."
1,No class system. COD controls. No voip. Sucks,"If you are expecting a good BF experience in this title, you won't get it. No traditional classes, meaning everyone has any item they want. So everyone uses medic items, but don't bother healing you. Some games you have 50 snipers on your team. No voip is dumb. Sliding around like call of duty just adds to the feeling of not being battlefield. I tried for 100 hours. This game sucks. Get a copy of battlefield 4. It is really cheap and is a lot better experience."
5,Great replacement controller,This was a gift for my grandson. He said it was exactly what he needed and it worked great.
1,Warning: Does not work with new system update,"Microsoft has announced that the new system update, scheduled to go live in November 2009, will disable all unauthorized memory units.  This will be completely useless then, and even worse, any save data or profiles copied to it will be totally inaccessible.  Microsoft's memory prices for the 360 are completely ludicrous, but unfortunately, now there's no other option."
1,Really wish I didn't buy it,"I have to subscribe the Gold Live service to use skype, amazon prime video etc, WTF?? I already paid for amazon prime, why would I need to pay again? Customers need to pay a subscription fee to use free software like Skype, God! This is just the stupidest idea I have ever seen! Also, this machine is too buggy."
1,XBONE SUCKS,"Console won't even start up, Clearly the xbone was a rushed console, get a ps4 and save yourself some time and money."
5,Nice Addition,"A little hesitant on the purchase, but pleasantly surprised when received. Hand fitment is just right. Programming the buttons couldn't be easier. Nice APP available for customization. Only negative for me is not being able to adjust the color or schema of the LEDS of the mouse itself. As it stands, it cycles the colors on it's own. Would be nice to be able to set it based on preference. Rechargeable is a huge plus, so no changing batteries. Range is great, pickup is clean. Great gaming or regular use mouse."
5,Good product,It lasted a whole year until my daughter decided to peel it off
1,Boring!,"The DS version is absolutely awful.  I bought both the DS version and the WII as it looked interesting.  The promos are for the WII version.  I actually bought a WII just to play the WII version of this game.  I'm completely sastified with the WII version, but the DS needs to be avoided."
5,"Take it from me, this keyboard is a winner","This keyboard is the most amazing thing you have ever used.  I have used mechanical keyboards continuously since the 80s for my software engineering.  Even when the mechanical keyboard was no longer in style, there was only one keyboard company making a mechanical keyboard in the USA during the 90s and 2000's.  That keyboard is the Avant Stellar, a clone of the original Northgate keyboard, a design that IBM used.  Yes, I have used mechanical keyboards more than just about anyone on the planet.  That said, the Corsair keyboards are my current go-to choice for most things.  I own many of them.  however, this keyboard from HAVIT is probably the best mechanical keyboard I have felt since the Northgate.  It is absolutely wonderful and makes me consider switching from the Corsair.  You can't go wrong with this one."
5,Easy to use program that offers a lot of features ...,"Easy to use program that offers a lot of features to help make your writing project organized and enjoyable.  I like it most because it can house many aspects of your writing project such as miscellaneous notes, character information, outlining, pictures, etc.  In addition, it offers formats to assist in structuring a story or building a character profile. I am very pleased with WriteWay...it works for me."
5,It plays the games,This renewed game unit plays all my games like a new one would. The video output is sharp and the game play is steady. I recommend this game unit for anyone who is a PS2 fan.
1,Fun but obviously released broken,"Bethesda released what is arguably the funnest piece of broken and unplayable game software in recent memory. Do yourself a favor and purchase this for PC or XBOX is you have those options available. Sure, they may fix it but for those that do not connect online to the Playstation network this game will become completely unplayable due to a very big bug. The problem is that as you play and solve quests your save file grows in size until the PS3's memory cache can no longer keep up. The framerate will then slow down the the speed of a high tech flip book. Bethesda should have known better but released it anyway. What a shameful cash in."
1,This is Bad,"This headset tangled like CRAZY. If you try to untangle, it will just ravel right back up. I tried to untangle it today, and it broke! Snapped right off of the remote. Avoid this headset like the plague."
5,Buen aparato para jugar mejor en el movil,"Me ayudo mucho a jugar mejor, muy buena calidad y resistente"
5,Almost like the original 360 controller,Everything about this controller is great. It's very tight and crisp and even has very sensitive movement through the joysticks (unlike other cheap copies that are either on or off). The joysticks are even shielded with a cover when shipped to prevent potential damage to the calibration. Only complaint about it is you can only turn the Xbox off with this controller. It has to be turned on by pressing the main power button on the console. No biggie
5,More like a dream than a game,"Beautiful graphics, evocative period music, hidden items that are at least plausible for the time period and sometimes part of the story, strong voice acting and narrative straight from the book--all these add up to an emotional adventure, more like dreaming the book than playing a game. For me, it was a more visceral experience than watching a movie. If you love reading The Great Gatsby, I think you will like this. If you want mysteries, adventure, challenging puzzles and won't be happy with anything else, don't buy it."
4,Overall review of the keyboard. 4.3,"Overall I would say that the keyboard is a solid 4.3 stars out of 5. The multimedia buttons are really helpful especially when I'm trying to pause my music in the middle of a game. The keyboard lights are really nice and I love the multiple different options (my favorite is the flowing rainbow one). The keys are well spaced out and that's perfect for me because I used to fat finger a lot. The last compliment for the good the good things the hand rest is really comfortable and lets me play for multiple hours perfectly fine. One thing that I didn't like about the keyboard was that the C and V keys are hard to click and since C is my crouch button and V is my voice chat button it makes some scenarios difficult. The last bad thing was that the keys were kind of annoying at first, but I have gotten used to it and I am starting to like it. It's just that the people around me find it annoying."
4,Excellent quality sound,"The sound is very good and high quality. It cancels out minor background noise very well, although you can still partially hear people close to you. I enjoy that I can take off the cat ears whenever I want. Makes going out in public with them on a lot less embarrassing. The two plugins for audio and microphone work very well with my computer, although you have the option for Bluetooth AND single plugin for something like an older phone's headphone port. The headphones are cushioned and very comfortable. My only concern is the quality of the microphone. You can hear buzzing in the background and it took a good hour of testing and changing around the input on my computer to minimize the buzzing. I can not get rid of the Bluetooth microphones buzzing sadly."
1,junk,"got it and never worked gotta wait 2 weeks for them to fix it, and they said for the inconvenience its free(yes cuz its manufacturer issue) dont buy until they fix themselves"
2,Disappointing,"I LOVED my dreamGear comfort grip for my old 3DS XL and even emailed them several months before this was released to see when this one would be available. You can imagine my horror to find that unlike the first, the bottom has to be removed to change out the game cartridge. Couple that with rubber that can become slightly disfigured from repeated removals and it's a recipe for a poor follow-up to a once awesome product."
5,Awesome,Works great! My son loves it!
1,Dont buy,To much story game play is terrible makes you watch entire story
1,One Star,"Online play gets boring fast. No single player story for a 60 dollar game? Only half a dozen maps. around 12 weapons only, and none of them are customizable...... the variety in this game is very limited.... avoid this game save your hard earned money for something else..."
5,Good game for someone with an imagination,This game is a lot better than RCT 2. There is so much more you can do and build. There is a mode called Sandbox mode where you have unlimited cash and you have all the rides unlocked. The only con in this game is that the size of the land you get is not that big. Yes you can fit a lot of rides but not enough.
4,"Very fun! A bit short, though","I'm not a sonic expert... Or long time fan... But I have to say that I had a blast playing this. I wish it had more levels and I miss taking corners like in generations in a ball. The level select was a little bizarre, but not too difficult to get used to. Luckily you can hit up and down to move in order, so if you get lost as to where you were last, keep hitting up and you'll find the newest level."
5,What in the world?,MCXB 360 this awesome. Nice but they could add horses but still fun!!!! :) So you should get it. Awesome
1,Please Read- NOT HOT SWAP,"First, this is a great keyboard. I really liked it. I got it as a beginner to mechanical keyboards. I'm giving 1 star because when I went to hot swap the switches I broke one. After opening the board I realized that they were soldered on.  Please make sure you know what you're buying. I'm not sure why the description says nothing about the board being soldered, especially as the box specifies that it is hot-swappable. You CAN NOT change the switches on this board."
4,Good fitting belt,"The belt fits large waists comfortably. It's great to have my hands free while learning the Zumba steps. The only issue is locating the buttons on the remote easily since its on your side and tucked inside the pocket on the belt. Overall, it's a good accessory for Zumba fitness."
4,Sketchy packaging,"The packaging is super sketchy, basically a zip lock baggy. My husband said they work but wouldn't buy again because of packaging and possibility that they were previously used."
5,the best controller for super smash brothers melee,"This white controller is, in my opinion, the best controller to have if you play super smash brothers melee for the Nintendo gamecube.  The controller is very durable (will last for a long time through button mashing), stylish, and you can perform all the technical skills such as L-Cancelling and wavedashing with it.  Anyone who is looking to replace their nintendo gamecube controller to play Melee, i strongly recommend getting this one."
2,Bummer.,"Item was not described correctly. Minor scratches and regular wear was acceptable and described correctly. However in the description it stated the item was tested and working correctly. Upon receiving the item and doing the initial set up, I had to pay to unlock the parental controls since I had no idea what the current password was. After going through all that hassle and unlocking the device I was super disappointed to find out the wireless was not working at all. Cannot connect to any wi-fi. Even had my home wi-fi settings changed to accommodate the devices requirements and nothing. Once the wireless button is turned on 2 seconds later I get an error message. Cannot use any features that require the wireless to be on. I have purchased used games before and this one was definitely a bummer."
4,Great Game!,"I have always been fascinated with cooking so I thought I'd try one of these games out and I have to say it was a lot of fun. The game has many recipes for you try out and you may even learn how to make them yourself after playing it enough. The game makes perfect use of the Wii's motion controls and the controls function very well for most of the motions with the exception of a few that require you to get a feel for them. The game is also packed with mini-games that are amusing and also has a practice option that allows you to practice any part of a single recipe so if you are having problems with a certain part you can practice them until you get them down perfect. The game only opens a few recipes at first but you will earn more as you complete the ones you have, if you enjoy cooking then you will enjoy this game as it makes it fun and without the mess."
5,A stylish blast right out of the gate,"I received this game right on the release day and have been having a blast. The art direction is top notch from Platinum Games, as the cyberpunk aesthetic starts off right from the intro sequence. The game is pure eye-candy. The combat is fun, and easy to get the hang of. The astral chain game mechanic is fun, a bit challenge at first, but the game forces you through training that gives it a very low learning curve. Unlike a lot of action, fighting games, this one is forgiving if you want it to be.  The story is getting pretty interesting, there's a good mix of puzzles, fighting, and story.  A very good start to the first few hours of gameplay."
1,One of the unlucky few,"Pulled it out of the rather shoddy box, plugged everything in... aaaaaaaand it's a brick. Sony says it will be WEEKS to get a replacement? Really? I was truly excited to play Assassin's Creed after skipping over the last gen versions. Now I guess I'll either pick up the last gen version or return the PS4 version and pick it up with Xbox One. This sucks."
1,cluncky,"been playing games for over 35 years, if you cant beat the first mission and have to redo it 25 times (jumping from roof to roof) it's probably best to put it down and let someone else waste their time....hate clunky games and clunky game charachters who run into walls, hang off ledges etc when your just trying to hop straight ahead...a mess of a game....I believe the reviewers of these games on Amazon are paid by the developers...they got to be...this game is garbage."
5,"Awesome, but learn the controls","The only reason people are giving this game low ratings is because they don't like the controls. It's a new game, the controls are different, they take time getting used to, but you can learn them no problem. Another thing people complain about is the motion controls, but those are pretty much optional. Don't use them if you don't like them. This game is a lot of fun and the controls are smooth once you learn them. It's pretty similar to StarFox64 (it's like a remake with a slightly different story and different stages) but with StarFox Assult mixed in. It's a lot of fun and a bit challenging. It's a shame people are still putting this game down over the graphics. Bad graphics don't make a good game bad, and vise versa, though I think the graphics look nice. I think if this game is given a chance, people could really enjoy it."
4,Shattered Greatness,"When I first saw a preview of this game I  couldn't wait to get it, after I played it. I'm happy I got it, this game is very satisfying to play this is a good step-up from Web of Shadows which was nice too.  I gotta point out what makes this game good, you're not just 1 or 2 Spideys you get to play as 4, each with their own unique moveset and purpose.  The Spideys are: 2099 Spidey he's from a hopeful future, seems to have a lot of  aerial levels,  then Noir Spidey  a 1930 version of Spidey who's all about stealthy and sneak attacks, then there's Amazing Spidey good old classic self-explanatory and of course the Black Suit Spidey with the awesome speed, strength and agility.  Each one of these Spideys have their own unique world, purpose and bosses they fight to find the shattered pieces of  the Tablet of Order and Chaos hence the name Shattered Dimensions.  A new feature in this I really like is the 1st person fights, when  you get to certain points in a Boss battle you switch to 1st person for a short period, that was a great idea.  Now for my review STORYLINE definitely better than past Spidey games 5Stars, GAMEPLAY 4 unique Spideys to play as 5Stars, BOSSES 4Stars, GRAPHICS 5Stars. Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions 4STARS"
5,Amazing product and amazing company,"There was a defect with the one they originally sent me but I have to say this. They have the best customer service!!! Not literally 3 min after sending them a message and pictures about the faulty product they responded with quick help, an apology, and a tracking number for the replacement product. This has to be the best experience I have had with any product I have bought on Amazon. After receiving the replacement not only did they give me a functioning product that worked perfectly but they also gave me 2 back ups and a case. And to make things even better... I got a card and a small apology note from the owner!!! I wish all companies were this pashionet about their business. Please if you need to buy any products this company provides, buy it from them."
4,Good value for your money.,"Keep this in mind before you purchasethe X-box 360 Arcadebundle. I had to buythe 20 GB hard driveseparetely, which is a must if you want to play the old X-Box games. In order to play the old X-Box games, you have to connect your X-Box 360 to the internet, or wait for a update disc from Microsoft. Thisis just a minor hassle, however. The game disc that is packaged with the arcade bundle is really addictive and fun to play. I would not buy this bundle and instead buy theX-Box 360 bundle with 2 free games and 20 GB hard drive instead."
4,Bit of a glitchy model.,"Shipment was very quick. However, when I pulled it out of the box and began setting it up, I did notice that the supplied hard drive has a few problems. Applications hang at times, and games saved to the hard drive have occasionally crashed requiring a return to the Home screen or a full restart of the console. It could just be my model, but it is a disappointment for a machine that is supposed to be incredibly powerful based on the hardware it comes with."
5,Good thing the charging cord that originally came with the ...,The cord that comes with the product does not work when connected to my PS4. Good thing the charging cord that originally came with the PS4 works with the product. Great buy and quality works great.
5,AWESOME!!,"I got this thing about a year ago.  At first, it ruled.  After a few months, one of the speakers started to make a popping noise every once in a while.  I emailed monstercable, and they sent me a new one, just like that.  A few weeks ago, one of the ports on the subwoofer went.  I emailed them back and they sent me a brand new one.  Now my system rules again"
5,Build the Bear,"I purchased ""Build the Bear"" DS Nintendo game for my 5 year old granddaughter and she loves it!  Some of the DS games are a little more advanced for her, but she is able to enjoy ""Build the Bear""!  Even her little brother, age 4, enjoys it too!!"
5,Beautiful Game!,"When I first started this game up, I was truly shocked and amazed! The 3D effects in this game are amazing, they blew me away! The graphics are clean and clear and so beautiful, the the puppies and kittens really do pop out and seem so real. Every little hair on their bodies stand out. Much better then the older Nintendogs games. It's so cute taking my Shiba Inu pup for a walk and watching him roll around in the grass or chasing birds. It's just a beautiful game to look at. I love that, instend of having 3 different colors, they have (using the shiba for ex.) 3 different black and tans, 3 different reds, and a tanish cream, all with different markings, some pups are even smaller then the others. The only downside is you can only keep 3 pets at home and 3 at the hotel (less then the older Nintendogs games). But other then that, it's a beautiful game with amazing 3D effects, super cute, and very fun."
5,The Action Pack Game,This game is excellent a wide range of weapons available there are tons of codes u can get for this game there are real weapons they use in the army and one of the best games ever made there are so many army games u can buy  out there i hope u order this game its at a great price. There are all  times of enviroments to play from beaches to forests this is an action  packed game.  My favorite thing about this game is the internet play its an  excellent game hope you like it.
4,Huge improvement over Classic Creep Capers,"You always fear a licensed console game these days.  For an example, rent Classic Creep Capers.  If you were over 5 years old, you probably didn't enjoy it all that much.  So I was a bit fearful when renting this one.  Much to my surprise, it was very enjoyable.  There are obvious technical problems to it.  There is marked slowdown throughout when Shaggy or Scooby is running.  The enemies do get to be redundant.  It actually reminds me of a lower quality Crash Bandicoot game.  Still, as far as licensed platformers go, it is fun.  For Scooby fans out there, it's well worth checking out and probably even worth shelling out the 30 clams for.  There is enough to it to have some decent replay value.  If it is for somebody 8-10 years old, I'd bet they love it."
1,Problems,"I'm so mad about this product. Got this for my son for Christmas and it worked great for about a month, now it does nothing. Since I ordered it before Christmas I can't return it. Imagine that, it stops working days after the return policy is up. Awesome."
1,Nintendo is dead to me.,The fact that these are REQUIRED to get the full value out of a product you just bought it disgusting.
5,"The Clone Wars have begun, and you're in the action","Jedi, tanks, gunships!  What's there not to like?  This game puts you right in the middle of the action of The Clone Wars.  Drive your hover tank through the rocketing explosions of missiles and pulse lasers, then leap out and attack armies of battle droids with your lightsaber as Mace Windu (c'mon, you know you want to be the slickest Jedi ever), then climb into the Assault Gunship and take down Separatist spaceships as they try to take off while dodging laser fire from fighters.  Pure adrenaline!  I highly recommend it!"
5,Great Value,"Been using these for gaming, a couple of weeks now. The fit is comfortable, not too tight. The cord is not the typical silicone coated wire but rather a braided, tangle free cable - It's a bit stiff, but loosens up after some use. The 7.1 surround sound is really nice and the boom mic provides clear audio. I really like the ""mute"" when you rotate the mic up - very convenient when you have to cough or speak off-mic."
1,Heroes III online game code,"One of my favorite old games however, this purchase does not allow you to play the game. It appears to be only for online multi player. If you want to play standard Heroes III maps, and lands do NOT purchase this"
4,The best Madden on the DS yet,"Another year, another Madden game on the DS.  This time around though, Madden NFL 08 ends up being the best installment of the long running series to hit the DS yet, with EA making some vast improvements over previous incarnations of the series.  The first thing you'll notice is that the 3-D player models on the bottom screen of the DS are much improved this time around.  That being said, they still might not be a whole lot to look at, but the game does look better in the graphics department this year overall.  The control scheme has also seen some tweaks, as has the overall gameplay and various play modes as well.  Not to mention that the Wi-Fi capability also ends up being one of the best features of Madden NFL 08, and is every bit as fun as it should be.  What really hurts Madden NFL 08 though ends up being the small amount of glitches that plague the overall game.  These glitches appear in the form of the game's graphics engine as well as the opponent AI (which is also quite forgiving at times, but then again, this is Madden after all) and are quite noticable as well.  Not to mention that the play by play commentary is hardly as prolific as what it could be, so don't expect to hear a whole lot from the man himself while you play.  Negatives aside, Madden NFL 08 ends up being the best Madden game to hit the DS yet, and for football fans that own a DS and are craving a more than solid NFL game (like you have any other choice), then look no further."
5,Works great with some draw backs,The keys are very responsive  but don't have a great distance for the usb but directly connected works just fine. Also I didn't expect the keys to be as loud but they still do the job and the you can change the color of the rgb backlight. Other than that it works as intended to
1,"Great hardware, TERRIBLE software","A hardware platform is only as strong as the software available on it. There is a dismal amount of content on the platform, similar to the apps available on a first generation iphone. The hardware itself is amazing, but their ""walled garden"" approach means that the software will always be mediocre at best. The tech is ALMOST there, give it one more generation and we'll have a VR headset that isn't this walled garden nonsense!"
1,Fake product. do not buy,Product was fake
1,Want to practice your drawing?,"I can't believe after buying the Limited Edition which came with the Prima strategy guide I still can't get the slate drawings to work. You have to have them absolutely perfect or you'll spend hours redrawing them. This is the most frustrating game I've ever played. I finished all the other Myst games in a few days. And enjoyed them mostly. I've spent 3 days and numerous game guide sites trying to figure out how to draw a symbol in Todelmer good enough to move along. If it wasn't for the startegy guide I would have assumed I was on the wrong path. I was able to get the first few slate drawings to work only after multiple tries. Never did see the difference from one that worked and ones that didn't. Any one want to buy this before I throw it the trash? I wouldn't even take your money. It's that bad. Also emailed Help at Ubi and they were absolutely no help. But of course, what did I expect."
1,not a game for children,"Ever since I bought this game, my 5 year old cousin has been chanting some diabolical verse about being the best like no one ever was. He has been chasing small animals and throwing balls at them. Whenever I ask him to stop he just tells me he has to catch em all. And just the other day he got enough badges to train Charizard so...I guess you could say I am reasonably concerned about this."
1,Disappointing,The game is lifeless.
5,Good product.,It a nice product feels comfortable and I like that there's no sound when you click. Highly recommend.
1,Persistent connection required,EA made a choice to require a always on internet connection to play this game which ultimately ruined it for me.  If you like waiting in queue to play what should be an offline game then buy this.  This series peaked at SimCity 3000 and this game will hopefully inspire a reboot.
5,Fam,It's lit
1,You get what you pay for.,Crap controller. Directional buttons are inconsistent. Do not buy!
1,scam,LoL the price
5,Great DDR starter kit ...,"I've been using this product for a couple of days now and have no complaints at all. I've been interested in buying an XBox to play DDR and decided to go with this first to see how much I'd use it. It works perfectly and is a lot of fun. No, it doesn't have high-definition graphics or a top 40 soundtrack, but for the price it definitely delivers."
2,Urban Camouflage ???,Ordered Urban Camouflage but got the Blue one ...... SMH ...
5,"Good value, excellent quality.","So far so good! Installed very very easily and it's an absolute perfect fit. Two little air pockets, but they were gone by morning. I'm happy with my purchase thus far! Would highly recommend."
5,Pleasantly suprised,I bought this game for my wife thinking it was childish and was not interested in it myself.  Boy was I wrong the game play is very appealing and the grafics are excellent.  I now end up playing this more than her.  It is an excellent game and I would recommend it to all ages.
4,Great Real Time Strategy game for Xbox owners,"At first I thought this was a second-rate Warcraft clone, and to a large extent it is, but I have to admit that I am having a ton of fun with this game, drawbacks and all.  Xbox owners are freakin' starving for strategy games and this one delivers.  Warcraft fans should enjoy this game as it is basically a dumbed-down version of that game with a few new quirks and great graphics.  One of the fresh ideas is the titans which you control and can use to stomp down many a foe.  One of these is a giant ogre that can eat enemies (or allies) to regain health as he swings his club in wide arcs, sending bodies flying.  There is also a giant slime that dissolves and absorbs enemy units to increase it's mass and power, a giant boar that launches flaming projectiles and rocks from a catapult on it's back, a lightning elemental, and a giant spiked ball that simply crushes the opposition.  Controlling these guys is superfun, but only a small part of combat.  As the game progreeses, you take over different goblin clans with various abilities and individualized units.  You only get 10 active goblins to a clan at once so choose your units wisely.  Each clan (you usually control 2 or 3 at a time) is assigned a button so you can leave one to defend basecamp, one to search for resources (gold for destruction and souls which are earned through battle or at soul fountains), and one to attack the enemies base along with a titan; or you can send all you've got at the enemies at once, or use any other strategy you can think up.  These features are what make this game original and fun to play even if you've played Warcraft to death.  Sure, the game lacks that game's depth, but it's still a lot of fun and you can't beat the price.  Besides, there isn't much RTS competition on the Xbox besides the also excellent Alien vs. Predator: Extinction.  The only major drawback to the game besides the aforementioned lack of depth is the lengthy cutscenes spoken in goblin language and subtitled.  They are actually quite awesome to look at and the story is cool (if pointless) but they take a ridiculous amount of time because of the subtitles which stay on the screen and hault the conversation so that there is a maddening 5-10 second pause between each line of dialogue, presumably to give you time to read the subtitles.  Apparently they think we all read at a 2nd grade level.  A single-player, customisable skirmish mode would have done wonders for this game, but there is only a multi-player version which I haven't played yet so I can't review that aspect, though I imagine it's sweet.  If you are a RTS fan and an Xbox owner who doesn't play PC games, your prayers are answered (in part) by this game and AVP:Extinction.  There are dozens of better RTS's out there on PC. But if that's not an option than this game is highly recommended."
1,Errors and disconnections within hours...,I plugged this into my M1 Mac Mini and transferred some data over.  Started getting errors and disconnections within the first few hours of use.  Returned to Amazon.
2,Lost in translation...,"Ironically, I had preordered the console version of Call of Duty long before I had played the PC version. Yet with the release date oh so far away, I decided to take advantage of the recent price drop of the Call of Duty PC game hoping that it would tide me over. However, after playing countless hours of the game on my PC, I'd have to say that Call of Duty: Finest Hour is a bit of a disappointment. I understand that a console has nowhere near the processing power of a PC, yet I couldn't help but feel underwhelmed by FH's graphics which were simple and bland at best. However, I was mostly disappointed in the lack of save points throughout a level. That meant after spending ten minutes or so blasting your way through a difficult level, you would have to start the campaign all over again from start to finish if your player is killed. I always appreciate a challenge, yet not when the odds are overwhelmingly stacked against me. The one aspect that the console version did translate well was the ""war is hell"" theme. The beginning level featuring you as a Russian soldier taking back Stalingrad from the ""steeking Germans"" was intense with gunfire raining all around you and enemy soldiers around every corner. The death animations are overly exaggerated which made in difficult to distinguish whether or not an enemy was either wounded or dead only to have them shoot you in the back. I played this game for only an hour before I filed it away with my other games. I imagine that I will someday go back, but in the meantime, I'm having too much fun with the PC version."
5,the fun of my life,"I am a 53 years old guy, it seems very old to be playing video games but let me tell you something. after the wheel was here, I spent 20 dollars on making a wood stand for it to drive more comfortably and got a used Forzamotorsport video game and let me tell you all this is more adictive than heroine, I just can't stop racing around Hockenheim, Atlanta, indy etc. there must be an AA for this game!!!!!"
1,500 dollar paper weight,Don't really play it due to that the controller hardly ever works even after following Xbox steps on resetting the controller and also won't sync other ridiculously expansive controllers!total garbage.
1,Scalper,This product is not from an authorized retailer and is charging over double MSRP.
2,Ouch!,"I have been robbed!! I cannot believe that I paid 40 bucks for this game! Nothing at all like the other wii dance games. The songs are great but the moves are the same on every dance. No guy would dance like they have the guys dance on this game and the girls all look trashy!! Nobody can match the movements because they are computer generated. Very disappointed. I just can't believe I waited this long for a country version and this is all they could come up with...My daughters wanted me to give it a 1 star rating. Disappointing. Sorry, maybe next time."
1,Gross,Nope. I'll give you 100 bucks.
1,"As others have stated, the PC physical copy only ...","As others have stated, the PC physical copy only installs about 5gb to your hard drive.  The remaining 20gb has to be downloaded from steam.  So, if you have slow internet, it will be hours or days to be able to play it.  There is no reason to buy a physical copy."
5,Driving Is Great,"If you like racing games, getting down and dirty around Daytona, sharing paint with the best then this steering console is for you. It is durable and when it is mounted to a secure surface,it can hang in there when the others bend and crack. I highly recommend this console as one of the best I have ever seen or operated. Money well spent!"
5,The best PS4 headset on the market!,"This headset is amazing. Perfect clarity and connecting to the PS4 was easy. I was debating between this headset and the Astro A50 Gen2, and these are just as good for a third of the price. If your looking for a truly wireless headset with 7,1 surround sound, get this headset!"
5,Works EVEN BETTER than one I bought from Nintendo!,"Connected with ease, and silkily glided the icon across the screen faster than Nintendo brand! The box came with a truly charming business card about the company that made the experience more interpersonal, an amazing touch that touched me."
5,Does The Job,"I'm a mechanic, and honstly i've had alot of screw drivers wear out prematurely - especially small tips like this. I've used it to repair the Wii nunchuks that my son broke the buttons on, and it worked perfectly. I see no reason I won't get good life out of it. Hold it in the screw firmly, go slow, then go to the hardware store and replace those stupid triwings with phillips head screws. And like other reviewers, the price was right..."
5,"Do not give up on this, totally worth it!","So so so happy with this purchase and service! I got the adapter  and it initially would not work and kept showing no signal. I read some reviews and saw other reviews stating the same issue but decided not to give up on it after 1 failed attempt. I emailed the seller, let them know the issue I was having. They quickly got back to me within a day of how to troubleshoot by using a small cotton ball with a ljttle alcohol on the connecting piece to the adapter and suggested as the n64 probably had not been used in some time it would need to be cleaned to make sure no dust settled. Well sure enough thats all it took. Turned my n64 back on and it worked right away! Pictute quality is what I expected being this console is from the 90s and technology has just exploded since. So so happy with this purchase all around and definitely recommend!"
5,Comfy and easy to use!,"The controller is very easy to use, as well as very easy on the hands. It's slick and sit naturally in your palms as you play with it. Tried many games with it and it's really nicely compatible with games with little to zero setup time on it. Completely plug and play. IMO it's completely worth the price tag!"
5,BETTER THAN TURTLE BEACH!,Really amazing quality. Good price amazing sound. I would totally recommend this to anyone to anyone who wants a fantastic headset. Totally beats turtle beach!
5,Great game controller,Good quality and perfectly connect with my Xbox.
5,Love this game,"Definitely one of my favorite games of the year. Very fun and very addictive. I completed my first playthrough in about 32 hours and I fully intend to start the second playthrough right away. I can't think of much to say that you don't already know -- millions of guns, lots of exploding heads, great style and character to this game. I giggled like an idiot the whole time. Highly recommended!"
1,Doesn't work at all,Mine doesn't work and it makes me sad.
5,Fits Oculus Quest 2 with halo strap.,This Rift S case holds the Oculus Quest 2 with IOVROIGO Adjustable Halo Strap for Oculus Quest 2 perfectly! Make sure you have a lens cover if you store controllers in with the Quest 2 or put the controllers in the lid pouch.
2,This game was a letdown and a waste of money,"This game was a letdown and a waste of money. The towns are no longer open, and you cant travel between lots in cars and brooms and things, and I understand that you need to cut down on some things, but why not make it only one town but have it still be a quality one? Also the graphics are worse than sims 3, and the whole feel of the game is that it came from sims 2, not after sims 3."
2,Tiny Heads Only,"When I received the glasses the lenses were partially popped out of the frame from shipping so do not expect any durability. The lenses themselves work great. I was impressed with how much longer I could play video games on my PC, or just use my PC, without little to no strain on my eyes. A huge downside, and why I am going to return them, is that the frames are designed for people with smaller heads. After not even 2 minutes of wearing these glasses the arms near my ears were hurting the sides of my head. There are others that cost more but after this experience I believe that the higher cost is justified."
1,"In 1997, this game would have been, well bad...","OK.  I was looking forward to this game.  Giant robots, with guns, blowing up stuff.  Nuff said!  Well, no.  From the moment you insert this game in to your Wii (on the disc start screen) you begin to see the home made production values that ""shine"" throughout the game. From the menu with no options (why have a menu).  To given 15 seconds to select your character, in a single player game, where the characters have different stats.  Then to the absolute lackluster game play.  Hint, to beat the boss without getting hint hold left.  When you're all the way left, hold right.  Apparently the boss has no clue how to lead a target moving in a straight line at a steady pace.  Not to mention that you have to shoot at like a billion things, and have NO autofire.  Save the life of your wiimote and don't even bother renting this one.  Too many good games out there to waste your time.  Or pull out a Saturn or Dreamcast and relive some quality games.  Hell they looked and sounded better ten years ago as well."
1,Game opened and downloadable content code used.  BEWARE.  NOT SEALED,Game came with plastic sealed around it but the seal on the actual game was already broken open.  Looks like someone bought the game and returned it for the free downloadable content code.  Amazon seriously.  Exactly as pictured is how the game came.  OPENED.  It is theft when someone opens a game and steals a downloadable content code for what I paid for
5,Finally a game about the Pacific Theater,If you like fun war games and are tired of fighting the Germans all the time this game is great.  I think most people forget there was just as much if not more fighting in the Pacific.  Do not listen to all those game geeks the graphics are great for PS2.  The best part is it is accurate in its history.  It is also rated Teen which means kids can play it not just big kids if you know what I mean.  I would like to see the game companies allow parents to turn the language off on some of these Mature games.  This is a great Christmas gift to get kids who are 10 and above.  Have fun.
1,"Do not buy, not anything as advertised.",Would give zero stars if possible.  This is product is Not hard. This product is not water resistant.  I paid a ton for next day shipping that never happend....  The case is nothing as advertised and to make matters worse completely reeks of cigarette smoke. The package smelled so bad that I had to throw it away as it made my office stink.  Bad company and I hope Amazon shuts you down.
5,Some of these reviewers are waaaay off.,"First of all , this is the best overall itteration of 2k yet. Yes, it is better than 2k11.I  have been playing this game since dreamcast and have never left. This game has excellent,commentary,animation,immersion,and gameplay. The legends mode is fun also. Overall a very,very solid game. I will say that the online needs fixing. But we are reviewing the game at its core. Meaning can a person without internet access enjoy the game. The answer is yes. I also won't blame 2k for the lockout. They can't add certain things into the game until the lockout is resolved. To all the reviewers who give 1 and 3 stars. Sounds like a personal problem or you misled your own self because when I read your reviews, they are both petty and ridiculous. 2k has been talking about what will be in the game for half a year. So if you purchased it expecting to have nothing but Jordan challenges, the wnba, and an nfl combine mode , then you may need to stop playing games altogether. Awesome game. Better than 2k11. Learn to adjust and adapt. If you don't like it, go buy EA's new basketball game whenever it comes out."
5,Great product,"Just built my very first pc and this bundle is really awesome! The lights all look beautiful and the sound of the mechanical keyboard is like Music to my ears! I also got the havit led big mouse pad and everything together looks stunning! The headset could be improved upon by adding a mute switch. For the price, this is worth every single penny."
5,Best game I never heard of,"Best game I never heard of!  My wife tells me to stop playing because she thinks I'll have a heart attack.  I've never been a soccer fan, but when you play with Rocket Cars, well, that's something else......."
5,great improvement,Old charger had to set the controller in the charger and it  would take just a little bump to stop the charge. Being able to plug the charger in to a cord is much better and the split cord makes it great to be able to charge to controllers at one time.
1,Would not work,"This was the 2nd Wii I tried to buy for my kids for Christmas. The first one was literally physically broken and this one would not let us move past the ""select the language"" screen. Very frustrating and disappointing for my kids. I am an avid Amazon user and RARELY write reviews- but this time I had to. I do not recommend purchasing."
1,"Don't buy this, this is NOT XBox 360 Power Supply","Save yourself hassle and don't order this item, because it is not XBOX 360 Power Supply. It is a power supply of some sort, but not for XBOX 360. I bought this and now have to go through pain of returning this :("
1,Worthless junk that will not load on my computer.,I tried for over 3 hours and the program will not install.  The disk will not work and I can not download the program from their web site. I wanted to upgrade to a newer version but I can not get it to load.
1,damaged,My child can't even play the game cause it was damaged. Got scratches all over it. I would like my money back because I done went and bought him another one somewheres else
5,Good time,Fun game.  You have the option to play just with the camera only and it does a nice job of picking up your moves.  My wife and I had a good time showing each other's dance moves off together and the video at the end showing our actual moves was fun.  Overall a great game and well worth the price of the game and the PS4 Camera.
1,Soo sound it makes me want to buy a new xbox instead.,"Wow, what can I say? Playing RDR2 for a week now, this thing sounds like the year 2000 CD drive playing quake or a little drift car drifting nonstop while I play. It honestly sounds like a cheap computer case fan that is spinning up and down constantly. It's so loud, it's annoying. Buying this power supply makes me want to go out and buy a new Xbox One so that I can play in peace again. I can not ever recommend this power supply to anyone."
5,The kids love it. One of the few games that can ...,The kids love it. One of the few games that can be played by four players simultaneously on the same machine on the xbox.
5,Good wheel stand,Met expectations
4,Fun Game,"This game is basically like the Grand Theft Auto series, but in HD and with more options.  I am a huge fan of the Grand Theft Auto series, so this game is right up my alley.  I would highly recommend this game to anyone that has similar tastes in video games."
5,Dual Charging dock for wii,"Great product, charges remotes for wii, does take a little while, but gives a good charge, light changes color when charged. My whole family has bought them, it really saves on batteries."
1,Vote with your wallet. Don't buy!!,Try adding splitscreen and maybe you'll get your fans back
5,No quarters needed!,Couldn't get my hands on the nes Classic mini but I didn't come home empty handed. A lot of these titles I use to play in arcades. I think my favorite part is I can save my games and no quarters needed.
4,"Comfy, but loads of light leakage.","Super comfortable with an excellent fit, but the thin orange plastic of the frame leads to an annoying orange glowing light leak all over the place. I placed electrical tape all over the the offending portions of the orange frame to black out the internals. Unfortunately, this also then plugs up the added ventilation holes to stop the lenses from fogging up. They need to make the frames either thicker to reduce light leakage, or just flat out a different color. Might have to give VRCover a try."
5,Best game ever!,I love this game!
1,I love Pokemon. I'm highly disappointed that it was suppose ...,"I love Pokemon. I'm highly disappointed that it was suppose to come today. And it didn't, now they are making me wait"
5,WARIOWARE ROCKS!!!,"Warioware has been my favorite franchise since the original came out and as a long time fan I have been waiting impatiently for the  last 15 years for a sequel. I was admittedly worried that it would not match up to the classics especially considering the new character based gameplay but boy was I wasting my time. This addition to the wario world is great, it looks, feels, and plays like the rest of them with new exciting elements and more replayability then ever. if your already a fan of or never played one is irrelevant get this game asap you wont regret it. to be loved and enjoyed by kids and adults."
1,Defective item,"Used this product for less than one day and it's defective.  Contacted the seller and they agreed to replace it.  After requesting that the seller tell me how it should be returned I received no response.  I am now sick with a useless,  defective item and will be selling other avenues of resolution."
5,Really fun game!,This game is a lot of fun!  I am not a gamer just a 40 something year old that loves a fun Wii game!  It's not hard to figure out and it's not complex. It's just fun.  My 8 year old and 20 year old love it too.
4,the device works exactly how it is suppose to its just that it feels like a cheap chinese product,"4 stars only because quality made, the device works exactly how it is suppose to its just that it feels like a cheap chinese product, i feel like i have to treat it like fragile glass or it may snap into pieces. but anyways the second version comes out soon that is suppose to fix that by making it a separate device plugged into console by cable."
5,Every Black Household in the World Should Have These!,These are the best black history DVD's that I have ever seen. They build Black people up instead of reminding them that they were slaves at one time. We need to know that we went through slavery but we are the trailblazers of history and innovation.
1,Cool concept ruined by Activision's greed,"Being able to create your own custom Skylander sounded like a really cool idea when the Creation Crystals were announced. You can chose from 1 of 10 different battle classes for your Skylander from brawler, to ninja, archer and other choices. There are all kinds of different ways to customize the Skylander and as you play through the game, you can unlock new parts. The thing that ruins the crystals is that there is no way to completely reset them. In past games every figure has fully been resettable back to level 1 and you can chose an upgrade path again. With these crystals, once you select a battle class the decision is final is there is no way to change the battle class. You can't even try the class in the game to see how it plays before making your decision. Yes there is a warning in the game saying the decision is final but most kids aren't going to realize what it means considering past games said the same thing about the figures and could be reset and there is no indication on the packaging that these crystals can't be reset. If a kid just picks the first class choice given and realizes they made a mistake, they are stuck with that choice forever. There was an option to reset the crystals in early versions of the game so it's obvious Activision changed the ability to reset the crystals just to get people to purchase more crystals."
5,Very interesting hybrid,"Chronicles of Mystery is a spinoff of a PC version of this game. Although the PC version is a classic adventure game, DS version has a different approach. The game is a mix of a hidden object game, adventure puzzles and most importantly, a lot of cool minigames, all this together makes a hybrid that surprisingly works really well. The graphics are great, story is not mind blowing but it fits the climax perfectly and the amount of additional content consisting of hidden object games and minigames is impressive. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone that likes adventure and puzzle games."
5,A great gamepad for a mac,"After 25 years of using PC's I decided to buy a Macbook Pro.  Great machine, anyway, I wanted to play some games on it and I had played tomb raider back in the days.  I need a gamepad to go with it.  I saw good reviews on this one, ordered one and received it, it didn't work.  I called Macally tech support and they told me my gamepad was bad and to get a return.  I contacted Amazon and within an hour I had a prepaid return label and a new one that had been shipped.  Got the new one, worked the first time.  Took a little while to get used to the controls but it works fine!"
5,Best PC gamepad out there,The XBOX 360 wired controller is the best PC game controller out there. Many games available on the PC translate very well to a controller format since it's pretty common to see ports between the various platforms these days. It works just like it would on an XBOX and Windows 7 automatically recognizes and configures the controller for you. No complaints at all. I have two that I use frequently for gaming on the PC.
1,Xbox Powerblock P.O.S.,Don't buy the AC adapter from this place. They are crap! The first one that came went to the red light of death as soon as it was plugged in. I contacted the seller who sent another one that immediately went to the red light of death again. So I contacted the seller yet again and I was told I had to ship them back to them which the shipping where Im at was more than the original cost of the adapter. So here I am with two more fried adapters and no working Xbox.
5,super item,"I bought this Item for my grandson, which made him so happy to receive it!  He just love it! Thank you!!"
1,TERRIBLE!,it lasted 3 charges and died permanently. BUYERS BEWARE THIS PRODUCT IS TERRIBLE!!! the sony battery may cost more but its worth the money.
5,Worked flawlessly!,Worked flawlessly!!
5,Good,Works like it should. Takes awhile for the controller to link even tho it's wired
4,Good product,Charges great
1,Buyers beware...,"Got my GP4 replacement from... and the game still would not start.  I went on the Internet to search for answers, and I have found many others experience the same problem.  For those (including me) who know very little about the ins-and-outs of the PCs, I would not recommend this game. I have GP 1, 2, 3, and I was eager to play this highly anticipated 4th version, I have nothing but disappointments."
5,Happy kids,Kids are thrilled. It came with both games in a combo box.
1,Should have called this Groundhog Day....,"If I could give it zero stars right now, I would.  I was so looking forward to this game.  Keeping in mind that I am not an adolescent with an endless supply of mountain dew and doritos (no offense, kids), I do enjoy gaming and have been since the very first Zelda game ever released.  That being said, I do not like this version so far.  The 3 day clock is one of the most frustrating things I have ever experienced!  You lose EVERYTHING if you go back to day one.  The tedious task of having retrace your steps and do it all AGAIN and AGAIN and AGAIN  is deflating and annoying. They could have at least thrown us a few bones and let you keep accrued items. At this point, I am going to try and return it.  So very disappointed...  And to all of the trolls who have nothing better to do than insult and attack people for having an opinion, please do not bother commenting as I will ask Amazon to delete any rude or offensive commentary.  Actually, I may just leave the comments so others can see how ridiculous you all are."
4,Pre order,"The game itself is great, my son loves it, but note to self...do not pre order games, the price is cheaper a few weeks later than for those who pre ordered...pathetic."
1,Can't use it  can't read it,When removal  coad strip  couldn't read coad on card  now I can't use card  disappointed in quality  product  made cheaply  never had this problem before  .
5,Awesome!,Really cool headphones that sound great! Highly recommended. These will make a great Christmas present.
5,CFS 3 Best sim ever?,"I'm a big sim fan I have all the combat flight sims so far and a few of the flight sims (combatfs 1,2 fs2000,2002) from what i have seen and read about this game its every cobat fligt simulators dream. 34 flyable aircraft bombers fighters torpedeo bombers and jet fighters! it has 3D sencery and alot of special features. Tail Gunner 2 if you have combatfs 1 you'll know what im talking about. Tail gunner 2 was a programe for cfs1 which let you use the rear,waist,tailand frontal guns on a bomber but it stopped you from using rockets. so what steveiy did (the guy who made tg2) was ask microsft to include tailgunner in the latest version of combat fs and there is a virtual gunner cockpit for it. Take it from me it looks stunning.Forget of the panel as we know it today because evrything is a virtual cockpit. No more 2D panels. You heard me mention fighter jets thats right they've been so knid to include fighter jets they are: Me262 A, Gloster Meteor, P-80 and the De Halivand Vampire they also included a little thing called role playing which i think is fun. You create a pilot give him a name a background and how he got into the aviation industry. He can be killed. Thats about all i can tell you for im running out of sapce and i could go on forever.But if you enjoyed 1and2 you will love 3. buy it!!!!"
5,Fun game,Jus like the old bandicoot jus 100 percent improved.
1,"Product is great, but Synapse ruins it","product worked fine, but Synapse 2.0 was unusable so I was unable to edit key bindings. sent in a letter to support detailing my issue but only got a generic copy pasted response that asked questions that showed they had not read my actual issue, and the response was severely out of date at that. would have given four to five stars but the issues with synapse make the product drop significantly in value. would not buy again until synapse is straightened out"
1,Agreed! Not for younger children.,"Bought for Christmas for my 7 year old, thinking it was along the line of Lego Batman, which he LOVES.  He's a smart child and reads exceptionally well, but is not enjoying this at all.  At some point we'll look up some help on the internet for him and see if that doesn't generate an interest.  It seems to be more of a long term strategy type game, rather than a jump in 'intuitive' style game.  He does love the intro with the skeleton's waking by the guard, ignoring the gate.  The graphics are detailed and excellent.  I'm sure in the long run he'll enjoy it, but it was not a hit.  To summarize, probably not for the younger crowd, but older kids who like more thinking and challenge will probably love it."
1,Don't buy it it's crap,Crap...just crap got a dead on arrival after ordering in June....Sony is all cheering in back round about the launch told the Rep they shouldn't cheer just yet cause it's crap....I would think for the price they could do better than this...horrible
1,not good,"not very good, very boring and mundane game, try final fantasy 8 instead."
1,?????????????????,"this game was a complete waste of my money, didnt even finish the game. im a big sons of anarchy fan, and love motorcycles, which is the only reason i bought this game in the psn. but what a mistake that was!!! game felt like it was made by a bunch of novices. shooting a gun in the game is useless for only headshots seem to work, graphics are like those of ps1, too much loading, and the random sex scenes is just plain unecessary. not even worthy of a grindhouse type feel to it. its a shame though because this game could have shown so much potential if done right. my advice....dont waste your money or your time, you'll regret u did!!!"
5,Good buy,Meh no code so your basically buying a basic ps4.
1,A Real Piece of You Know What,"This thing DOES NOT WORK. Do not buy. We've spent two days trying to calibrate the controller with the system and never successfully got it calibrated. It's very sensitive to bright light, but even closing all the curtains and shutting off the lights does not make it work for us. When I got online to search for a solution, I found that tons of people are having the exact same problem. So now I have a hundred dollar piece of crap that's completely useless. Stay away from this product."
5,"Shinobi, The Classic  Super Ninja is Back!","If your a hard core gamer, you have probably played the Sega game Shinobi. Now 8 years later, Sega is putting out that game for PS2 that couldn't be cooler. In this game, you will play as Hotsuma, a lightning fast ninja swords man, who must protect modern day Japan from evil Demon ninjas . This kick ... ninja can slice through enermys with his katana (sword), run up and across walls like the Matrics, and use ninjyutsu (ninja magic) to obliterate any enemy in his path. This will be an extremely high-speed combat game with very challanging enemys, such as thirty foot tall demons, demons that can turn invisible and even military tanks. This game is going to be a very hard, very bloody, and very intence. If you don't like those kinds of games, don't get it. If you do, this will be one of your favorite games!"
1,Could be good BUT,This game is great if you can play multiple turns in one sitting.  However there is an issue with the save game feature where the AI basically resets every time you have to load your game.  So if you can only play one or two turns before having to save and then load again later the AI will not expand at all.  You are left playing a fatally crippled opponent.
1,NOT HAPPY,I DID NOT FIND THAT IT WAS LIKE DIABLO II AT ALL I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED IN IT. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS TO ANY TRUE DIABLO GAMERS.
5,Great product,Works perfect
5,Fleet Command,"This version of the Game is spectacular............Playing this in Windows7 is awesome................Same game,different platform........If you are into War sims,you'll be delighted with it.................."
1,Does not work,Will not sync with my device. I'll be returning it.
1,The unit that shipped to me was complete garbage and wouldn't play a single game,"The unit that shipped to me was complete garbage and wouldn't play a single game, and Amazon won't help you at all.  Buyer beware, these things are not tested at all"
1,Might be ok for kids,"Like the previous reviewer, I'm hooked on the Nancy Drew PC games and pre-ordered this one.  There is no challenge to this game at all, you walk through rooms and everything that you are supposed to see is highlighted.  The mini games that you play to make characters more willing to talk are extremely easy.  It might be an ok game for a child, but if you're an adult and want something that even remotely resembles the Her Interactive PC games, don't waste your money on this."
5,Good game,Very creepy. I'm 24 an this game freaked me out. So much to the point where I needed to turn it off an calm down a bit before playing again. I haven't beat the game yet but I'm very happy with my purchase
5,Was a big hit for my older son on Christmas ...,Was a big hit for my older son on Christmas. Both my boys opened it and played games.  Brought back memories for me and the older son.
1,this is the most terrible fishing game i ever bought,"put the game in my ps4 and it updated , so was having some fun then it kept reeling  and never got fish in , ps4  turned it off and said it errored it then up loaded a patch, well that was the end of my fishing took poles and I did everything I could too get fishing again , did the tech part and it showed how to get everything then it went too fishing again and there I am without no fishing gear,now my friend come tried too get it working and he couldn,t get it working, VARY BAD GAME spend 22 hours trying too  get it working  didn,t even need 1 star it should have 0 stars"
2,I have been super excited to receive this as I have been waiting ...,I have been super excited to receive this as I have been waiting a long time to get an xbox one because I wanted the Halo special edition one that I hoped they would and finally did come out with. I was ecstatic going through the box looking at every little thing and then I unpackaged the actual xbox itself and I noticed a small little scuff on the top of it. I know it might seem stupid to some people but when I buy something this expensive brand new I expect it to be in pristine condition. The xbox one halo edition looks like a piece of art so that little flaw really does bother me. Not sure if it can be returned over that but also it shouldn't happen in the first place. Also the thing wouldn't start at first. It would make the noise of starting but then not actually start. At first the button was unresponsive and nothing wold happen. Unplugged the HDMI and put it in the HDMI in which got the sound effect to work then put it back into the HDMI out and then it would start. Also I had to hold it through the whole sound effect for it to start if I didn't it would only play half the sound effect and stop.
5,Good game great improvement from 14,Plays really well. Improvement from Fifa 14. Ea definitely tweaked it more. I would recommend if you're a huge fifa fan. fifa 15 plays really well I'm a bit surprised. Well done to you Ea. Fifa 15 is both fun and challenging. You'll experience a lot of grief and happiness while playing just like when you're watching a match. Plus graphics look better than 14 imo. :D
4,Know what you are buying.,"This is one of the least expensive places on the internet to get this new version of the game. But this is not the Limited Edition which costs a bit more. The Limited Edition version has interviews with the game development team, special mods, and some original artwork, developer diaries and alternative packaging concepts. But, if your not interested in all this other stuff not part of the game itself, save your money and order it here."
5,"COMPACT, QUICK, LIGHTWEIGHT, PERFECT!","I thought this would be kind of bulky and cumbersome but it is actually quite compact and fits well next to my PS4.  I never needed one before and am grateful that the first time I ordered one it was of the best quality.  It charges my controllers quickly and is more efficient than having to keep my PS4 in rest mode to charge them up.  I appreciate the very prompt and quick delivery of the product, along with the very strong packaging."
5,Protect your iPhone camera Lens!!!,These have helped save my grandsons camera lens a couple of times.  He is a mechanic and always has his phone in his pocket (why? I don't know!) and is bumping into things.  These have definitely protected his camera lens on a couple of occasions!  Worth the cost!!!
5,So much fun!!!,"So much fun with the perfect amount of challenge. Love being able to play the game as Luigi instead of Mario's hat, that's for sure! I haven't played Super Mario in 30 years but I picked up the controller and was able to pick up where I left off and impressed my 8 year old son! I loved and appreciated the familiarity of the classic characters and was instantly addicted to playing with AND against my son, lol! If you're looking for a fun game for all ages, then I definitely recommend you buy this now - you won't regret it!!! Love, love, love it!!!"
1,Refurbished Nintendo Switch!,"When I received my bundle, nothing was wrapped in the original plastic packaging. When I inspected the screen of the Nintendo switch, there is a white particle in the lower right, in between the touch screen and LCD.. Very distracting while the system is on because it appears to be dead pixels... I will update with pictures later. Also it looks like someone attempted to clean the screen with glass cleaner or something that damaged the bezels. I want a new switch.. This is unacceptable."
5,"A great collection, better than anything Namco or Midway did","For the past few years, Midway and Namco have been rereleasing old games in their collections.  They would throw 6 to 8 early 80's games on a cd with nothing extra and charge an insane amount of money.  Then along came Activision.  Activision obviously learned from Midway and Namco's mistakes.  Instead of 6 to 8, you get 45 Atari 2600 games.  Want extra features?  Ok, how about TV comercials from the 80s and those patches you could earn for their games.  But they did not stop there.  They added a truely impressive 80's soundtrack to keep you going.  There are also added ways of playing the game.  For example, one method overlays clouds over the game.  Another has a large rotating cube with the game on each side.  These extra ways of playing the game are interesting, but you will mostly just play the games the way they were.  Overall, this is what a collection should be like.  If you want to relive the classics or are interested in where the video game industry first got its start, you should check this out."
1,What a mess...,"I was looking foward to this, mainly because I like the Rugrats show. At the time this game was released (about June 1999) the Rugrats TV show had pretty much become a show for kids only with nothing redeeming for older audiences. With that in mind, the Rugrats license didn't need a game like this. This game tries to cash in on the success of Mario Party, but it fails to do that. Why? This is just a normal board game, which is all fine and dandy, but there's absolutely nothing to make you want to play this again. It has no mini-games like Mario Party. It has only one, count it, one play mode, and because of that, the replay value is really low. Even the four-player mode can't reedem it. But that's not all. The graphics are so bad for N64. I've seen PS1 games that look better then this, and those games came out years before this one! Why THQ didn't support the Expansion Pak is beyond me. I think it would have helped. The biggest problem (that I also stated above) is that the game is literaly over before it begins, and being priced at almost any dollar amount, this game is a rip-off. It may have been worth it if it was priced at a low dollar amount, but I wouldn't bet on it. There is some good though: The sounds and voices are nice, the controls are very simple, and the Rumble Pak feature is nice. But since it's so short and boring, it destroys all the fun. I know THQ was trying to aim this at young kids who aren't good at video games, but they failed even on that level. Games like Tigger's Honey Hunt (also on N64), are made for young kids in mind, but are also enjoyable for older audiences (and games like that usually have more replay value). Even for its target audience, there is no fun to be had here. Skip this and let your kids try Tigger's Honey Hunt instead. But if you really need a Rugrats game, get Search For Reptar on PS1. It's the best Rugrats game out there (though that's not saying much) and it has much more replay value then this."
5,great launch game,"As you already know, it's a clever and fun game.  What's even better is you can just order it here digitally, get the code.  Go to nintendo's website, where your account is linked to the switch.  Put the code in,  when i checked my Switch later, it was already downloaded and ready to go lol.  perfect!"
5,Great Game and Great way to give as a gift,Yes this is only the voucher for the download but it was perfect for us because it gave the case so it could be put in the sticking for St. Nick's Day.  This is a great way to give this as a gift becuae it gives a tangible object to wrap.
1,One Star,Scroll wheel didn't work. Mouse wants very comfy
5,Five Stars,The adapter works well with a Raspberry Pi with an installation of RetroPie.
5,Awesome Game!!!,A great game for nostalgia.
2,Disappointed,"This game isn't near what I expected from EA Sports.  I'll give credit for the sharp graphics, but there are only two modes of play: exhibition and tournament.  There is NO SEASON or DYNASY mode!!! Unbelievable!!! EA, you've again failed to make a solid college basketball product.  I'll be returning my copy tomorrow.  Potential buyers beware."
5,It does not look like a RENEWED SET,"Yes it is a RENEWED SET but it came in the ORIGINAL BOX  , however there was now instructions and a few of the cables did not have boxes or labels on them .  However with a few videos on YOU TUBE it was easy to set the VR headset up without the instruction sheet.  It worked perfectly from the start and has become popular in th efamily to either watch 360 VR videos or playing VR Games.  Renewed or refurbished is a gamble sometimes but with the backing of AMAZON it should be a good and rewarding purchase of this type of good"
1,Epic Fail,"Wow I have really liked the work out games, the sports games, and the adventure game so for for Kinect.  But this one ... what an epic fail!  This game is the one that will seldomly get played.  Thank God they didn't bundle it with the Kinect or I would have taken it back to the store the day I got it.  Horrible motion tracking and control during game play, it's at a level far below any of the other Kinect games.  You will be disappointed if you buy this.  I really had high hopes because I wanted to play beer pong and bean bag toss with my friends when we partied at my place.  It has a lot of games but they are all so frustrating to control."
5,This is Going To Be A Really Awesome Game!,"I have played and beaten the first game of Kingdom Hearts and it was truely awesome. But if you think that It'll be the same as the PS2 game...you are wrong! Instead of running around and slashing at enimes you run around and choose card to play. For example, you have a number of cards in your hand, you and whoever you are fighting play a card at the same time. Who ever has the higher card attacks as much damage as shown on the card. Donald and Goofy are not with you in this game but you can summon cards with them on it and they will help you for a brief time. You can also use other cards such as Genie, Bambie, and all the others. Although the screenshots may seem like their from the first game they are not. Sora is on the path where the first game left off. A hodded mad comes and tells him up head is a mansion with someone inside that is very dear to Sora. But to get to that person Sora must loose something very important. As Sora wanders throughout the mansion memories come back to him. Such as Neverland, Wonderlan and Halloween Town. But he finds at the end is up to you to find out. So play the game! It is going to be truely awesome!!!"
5,worked flawlessly!!,"Im just going to say my console is working great. It is everything I expected. Do not get dismayed by the low reviews on here. If something doesnt work, people are going to post about it instantly. You never get the good reviews until later.  I love my ps4 ! The next generation is finally here!"
1,The game is a lot of fun. But Origin has some screwy setup where you ...,"The game is a lot of fun. But Origin has some screwy setup where you get screwed out of playing the game after a month. Then you contact support, they get you up and running again. You don't play for a couple of months The game doesn't work. Contact support again and they won't help you at all. Don't buy anything with the Origin name on it, you will only have misery and disappointment from the fact that they took you money."
1,Code went invalid in less than 24 hrs - beware,"Purchased last evening, went live in my Sony account.. today notified the code is no longer valid..."
5,The doctor will see you now.,With a high-quality sculpt and sturdy craftsmanship; the Dr. Mario Amiibo is a worthy addition to the wildly popular line of collectible figurines. Great for Super Smash Bros. players and fans of the Dr. Mario puzzle game.
5,I like this case!,"Ok, so I just got a PSP3000 and needed some good protection. I am an adult with medium size men's hands, and, although I like that the PSP is small, I find it's almost too small for playing pleasure. In fact, when I first got the PSP3000, I was jammin' to God of War, side-steppin' and slashin' baddies with Kratos' blades when the PSP almost flipped out of my hands! Because the PSP Slim (2000 or 3000) has such a small form factor, if you have medium to large hands, you should definitely consider getting the Logitech case. The  case is a clam shell design that fully protects the PSP from front to back and allows access for you to play the PSP while it rests within the case, therefore giving it a little more bulk for those of us adult PSP users. The upper part of the clam shell also folds back and doubles as a stand if you want to set your PSP on a table to play. Also, the case includes a template that you can use to cut out pictures, illustrations or just about anything you want and use as ""wallpaper"" inside the case. I'm a grown man and I didn't think I'd ever avail myself of this little feature, but lo and behold I've now got a nice little human skull illustration on my Logitech case that I downloaded for free from the Playgear Pocket Skins website. Lastly, the Logitech case is also very, very reasonably priced. That's my two cents. . ."
1,This product is fake. Please save your money and ...,This product is fake.  Please save your money and wait to buy the real one.  This one is double the price.
1,WARNING: 4 GB Xbox Users - DO NOT BUY! WON'T WORK IN HD,"I preordered the game and was really looking forward to it, but unfortunately EA did not disclose that the game won't play with HD content (as it's intended to be played - as they show you how the game looks like in the demos) with a 4 GB Xbox system.  The game without HD looks like something from the original Xbox - not a current gen system.  Do a search for ""installing HD content Battlefield 3 Xbox 4 GB"" and you'll see all the complaints. They screwed up big time with this."
4,A Tight fit if you're tall or thick.,"Its a tight fit. I'm 6'1"" and 200lbs. If you have thick thighs it may be uncomfortable after an hour or so of playing. There's two metal pieces that also jut out directly into your legs. You'll also need to put a pillow behind you in the chair or your back will hurt. Otherwise decent but a stand and separate chair might be better ergonomically. Also hqve no idea how to mount a handbrake to it. Using an xl65r shift mount."
5,Shiny,"Buttons feel and look great, YouTube gave me the install instructions as I've never rebuilt a controller so figuring out the springs took a moment but nothing super difficult. Biggest complaint, I didn't buy another set for my other controller yet."
1,"Horribly Online, Horribly Broken",Not even the massive paycheck EA gave me to say something positive about this game could make me look past the proven unnecessary always-online DRM and atrocious number of game breaking bugs.
5,A great option from KontrolFreeks,"I am a big fan of the lower directional joystick and the higher aiming joystick. The Vortex are a good option for this because you can get both styles in one purchase rather than having to buy two sets. They snap on easily enough. The directional cap is concave and easy for your thumb to sit against for long periods. The convex aiming stick is ideal because it allows you to roll your thumb over it while aiming, while a convex stick could potentially cause slight slippage when you're trying to aim precise at awkward angles. I have no complaints about the vortex design, it allows for some good grip. The color choice is not my favorite, but it's not terrible either. Overall, I am very satisfied. I do recommend KontrolFreeks and have them on all my PS4 and Xbox One controllers."
5,Durable and compact,My son loves it!! I wish that I had purchased a case that could also house his AC adapter and Joy-Con support.
1,Typing is HORRIBLE!!!!!!!  TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! RUN!!!!,"I had such hopes for this keyboard, but the longer I use it, the worse it gets. Numbers don't type; numbers type in duplicates; numbers type in triplicates; letters don't type; letters type in duplicates; letters type in triplicates. I have to either bang on the keys to get them to work or touch them V-E-R-Y  S-L-O-W-L-Y to make sure what I've typed is correct. Takes twice as long to type something than it would on a ""normal"" keyboard. If you want something that looks pretty, this is it. If you want a keyboard that actually works, run like the wind and purchase something...anything else!"
5,Greymoor,"Very excited to finally receive my Greymoor CE. Everything is beautiful. The statue is very detailed, the coins are solid and  have weight to them. I especially liked the movie tin,  which has felted spaces to keep your coins. Wished they would have packaged the coins in the tin instead of  the tray the statue came in......took me at least 30 minutes to remove the coins...lol. All in all a great CE..I have all of them."
5,Nice,Perfect for the Wii controllers
5,Worked Great.,"In the images the Blue is the OEM joystick and the green cable is the new ones. The green cabled ones have a hard piece of plastic to allow it to be inserted into the connector easier, which worked great on one of the joysticks. On the other the little hard piece fell off, but the seller immediately turned around and shipped me replacements. There were no directions included but a simple youtube search taught me what i needed."
5,"AWESOME KEYBOARD FOR THE PRICE, WOULD DEFINITELY PURCHASE AGAIN!","If you want a nice static RGB white keyboard (meaning the colors DO NOT change, but light up nicely with option to fade lower or turn off) this is the best Keyboard you can get for the money.  The keys feel good and have a little bit of grip on them.  This is not a mechanical -type keyboard so don't expect that kind of feedback when typing on it.  The keys respond great so if you're a typist you'll love this keyboard either way.  It's clean looking and I'd definitely purchase this over a standard keyboard, especially for the price!!!"
5,Great Farming Simulator Game!,"Bought this farming simulator game for entertainment purposes.  I am hopelessly addicted to it.  You can do just about anything you want in this game.  The possibilities are unlimited!  You can also download mods or even create your own mods to alter the game if you wish.  Here you can farm with crops, animals, or you can go into the logging business.  The choice is yours!  I would recommend this game to anyone.  The equipment depicted in this game are based off actual equipment and the graphics in this game are incredible.  Well worth the money."
1,Worse Choice Ever,Listen when people say this DRM is a problem and a pain. Right now I have a fifty dollar paper weight. I wanted to play this game it looked great for X-Box but it causes to many system problems even on a very powerful gaming computer. I went from trying to play Mass effect which caused several software conflicts and system crashes to going back to Icewind Dale a game made In early 2000 without codes and protection. Now I must admit I will not buy any product with DRM or anything like it. Now I will wait till the hacker and piraters fix it and then if I want it I'll play it. Ive only felt the need to have one hacked game because I didnt think it would be good then I bought the expansion packs which still made the company some money. Bottom line is this program only effects Legit buyers making them get pirated versions. Only get this for X-box if you own one
1,Doesn't run on MAC OS 10.6 (Snow Leopard),"This product would not load on my MAC running OS 10.6 (Snow Leopard), despite its advertised claims."
5,Very good product,These are awesome! They lock in place and do not come out! I really shook my wii remote whwn I got these to make sure they did not come out.  I'm not even using the silicone sleeve which does not come with this product and it works great. Overall I'm preatty satisfied.
5,Just finished playing,"This is the first of the ND series that I've played without having to look up cheats a hundred times. Unlike the previous adventures, there were several places (not just one) where Nancy was caught in a ""second chance"" situation - I think that makes it more exciting. I played the Senior Detective and only got really stuck twice - otherwise the hints were pretty helpful. This probably isn't the game for the very experienced gamer, but if you have played and enjoyed any previous ND games, you will not be disappointed here. It's low on violence and high on creative thinking. I wish there were more female oriented adventure games like this series. Have fun with it!"
1,Not what I expected,I received the game that was ordered. I however received the game in a case with no art work and no poke'walker. Pretty disappointed!
4,The next big game?,"Aside from Halo 2 on Xbox, one of the most talked about games thats going to be released this fall is Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. Many new features have been added from previous games in the series. Its going to be a much larger game. You're not just stuck in some small cities, you've got a much bigger area to explore. The graphics look improved from what I've seen in screen shots, and I doubt they're will be any pop in, because for a next generation game, pop in would be pathetic this far into PS2's lifespan. You can steal new vehicles, including trackters, and my friend told me he saw a screen shot of a guy mowing a lawn. You have to eat in this game to keep up, but, like in real life, if you eat too many fatty foods like donuts and you dont exercise it off, then you're charecter, Carl, will become a fat guy. This game will be set in a ghetto type area in California. Early rumors said that the next Grand Theft Auto would be set in Las Vegas, but those were false... its set in California (that would have been cool, though). In the past four Grand Theft Auto titles, it was annoying how you couldent swim. You could rob a store, you can steal a car, but you couldent swim. Well, this time, like in the recently released (and dumbly titled) ""Driv3r"", you can now swim. Woo hoo! If Rockstar North (previously DMA (Doesent Mean Anything) Design Games) can add exciting missions and enough new gameplay to keep this fresh and fans happy, then it'll have yet another hit on its hands. This is not a final review."
5,Best wireless mouse on the market,"Logitech has pushed the boundaries of wireless gaming mouse. It's only 80g, long battery life, and the overall design is fantastic. I heard many users complain about the left and right click being overlapped, but that was only a problem on the older version of G Pro wireless. You can contact Logitech for a replacement for the new version that the issue has been fixed."
1,Gross and Unprofessional,"When I opened it there were fingerprints and hairs inside of it and the device had not been factory reset. There was a good bit of information on the past owner, luckily no credit card info had been saved on the device. It works fine but I won't be buying anything from them again."
5,Save our controllers,This worked out better than buying new controllers. My husband had to do a little adjustment but if we order the right one he wouldn't have. Worked great!
4,a good replacement for the original Rift,"I purchased the original Rift a year or two ago, and I enjoyed it a lot but had issues with the tracking cameras as well as the way it sat on my head, making it near impossible to play comfortably for more than an hour. With the Rift S, setup and tracking is much easier, as well as the comfort level. Minus 1 star for a compromise when it comes to audio"
5,A Must Have!,"This Action Replay is a must have if you want to play Jap games on a US system or vise-versa. It has over 8000 blocks of memory to save your games, and is a gameshark as well. A very nice product, but a word of warning: It is best if you just leave the AR in your system as you will wear out the cart. slot taking it in and out at an alarming rate. And the only way to replace it is to find a parts satrun with a good cart slot!"
1,One Star,Cool product but there was a monster in box. Would not buy again. Would not recommend.
1,Does NOT come with adapter.,"the description of this product states it has all necessary accessories and parts however does not come with an AC adapter that is needed for the product to work. We could not use the product. Had the description been accurate I could have ordered the adapter at the same time. I hope the description gets updated. If you read the reviews, order the adapter."
1,Requires a bethesda.net account,"Beware, this game forces you to register a third party account to be able to play even the single player campaign."
5,Made a kid smile,My 8 year son really love this game
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I purchased this case because it was the only one I could find during the Christmas season. This turned out to be a total waste of money. This case is only big enough for the DS, that is it. There is no room for games or the charger. It actually has 2 openings on the bottom where my son's games have fallen out. Save your money for a better case."
1,Super NES Classic,"Thank you Nintendo for making it difficult to own a Super NES Classic. After much research, I'll have to go the alternative and use a Rasberry Pi 3 which will include over 2,000 SNES games. See what ya' done make me. :)"
1,I Don't Like This Game AT ALL!,"About myself, I've never been a Nintendo owner until the Wii.  So I've never played any previous versions of this.  It seems to me that this game is only fun for people who grew up playing other versions of this.  There was so much Buzz about this game when it was coming out, I wanted to get it, which I regret.  For me, it got boring really fast. It just seems like more of the same over and over again.  I'd rather play Wii Sports Boxing, or even Punch-Out.  My young son doesn't seem to like it much, either.  He'll turn this game off in 10 minutes, where normally we have to force him to stop playing video games.  Rent this one before deciding to buy."
5,Teenager approved,"I bought these for my youngest son. They were at least the 4th headset I've purchased, none have ever lasted very long. We haven't had them long enough for a true endurance test, so I'll update in the future if needed. What prompted the 5 star rating is my son letting me know that his friends have all been asking what brand his new headset was because the audio was outstanding,comparable to a desk mic. So far, a great value. This is following sets from Turtle Beach and Pyle. I went with a lower cost set since it would be cheaper to replace. To date, they exceed the performance of the more expensive sets they replaced."
1,Check your location before purchase,I am not able to use outside US and not able to get a refund
1,One Star,Complete garbage.
5,Awesome,So far so good!!!!! Awesome color l!!!!
5,Just what the gamer ordered!,Was a little sketchy on how I would like this grip. Thought about it for weeks before buying it. Now that I have it i'm glad that I made the purchase. it makes the Switch Lite much easier to hold.
5,Surprisingly great!,"I bought this since my regular Xbox mic stopped working, and I'm honestly pissed I used to spend money on those when this is just plain better! Fully immersive, surprisingly good sound cancellation (not a feature, just the headphones are powerful enough that you can't hear anything else), and the mic responds great. My only gripe is i'm used to having my mic on the right side, not the left, but even then that's a minor complaint! This is worth every penny."
5,Amazing Game - Definitely Buy,"Maybe if the other reviewer werent so busy ramming his political opinions down your throats, he would've had time to mention that Minecraft is one of the greatest games on the Xbox 360, and a must buy for any elite gamer, casual player, or family."
5,PC Gaming,"I use this for PC Gaming and nothing else. It's lightweight, with smooth functions and no plugins required. I'm using it to play Octopath Traveler, FF12 Zodiac Age, Far Cry, every emulator from N64 to SNES, and the center button even activates my Game Bar on Windows 10. Came in a small box bubblewrapped."
5,Feel like I'm really flying a space ship,Use this for Elite Dangerous in VR and it really completes the experience. Feel like I'm really flying a space ship.
5,"They work, they feel right","Been replaying some old games with these and they both feel exactly like the original Nintendo ones to me, It's been years since i held a GameCube controller so there could be minute differences but at the end of the day, these work so i cant complain"
4,A nice gaming headset...,Ordered these for my gamer son and he loves them. He wanted a headset that he could use while he plays Destiny and makes YouTube videos. They're comfortable and have good sound as well. The only issue is that they're HUGE and could have been slimmed down a little bit but they're otherwise really great.
5,Very satisfied with a shopping.,"The quality of the bag is good. The game machine is just right in. The shell has a certain degree of hardness, which plays a protective role. Other data lines can be placed inside. The design is reasonable. It's very convenient to take out. I always like it. It's very suitable. I can put a power bank"
1,Buyer beware! Zero stars,"Buyer beware!! This is a scam. Bought this for my 9 year old grandson's birthday. He went to use it and it didn't work. We called Sony and they said the card number was already in use. How embarrassing! I emailed the merchant explaining the situation and all they said was that it was a brand new card and unused. Yeah, right! Frauds!"
1,trash,trash
5,Love this QUIET mouse,"Im not a gamer. I ordered this mouse because the clicker is silent and I wanted to use it in meetings without disturbing others. Also it lights up :-). The light can be turned off to save battery, separate switch from the mouse itself. Very ergonomic . The only thing i DONT like is that the button on the left by my thumb is easy to click and it takes you back in a browser so Ive lost some stuff I was working on when accidentally hitting it"
5,Same old game! Same old charm!,I love this game! It's the same old package just with a brand new coat of paint. This is probably the most polished pokemon game ever. What can I say about this game that hasn't been said before? After all these years still a lot of fun! Definately recommended!
1,NOT for GameCube Minidiscs,"This is a CD case plain and simple.  It's not made for MiniDVDs, and the discs just slide around inside it and will probably get scratched  after a while. I'm surprised Nintendo even let them make this.  If you want a real MINIDVD case for your Gamecube games, go with Pelican brand.  It's tiny, MiniDVD sized, has a soft foam case and holds 12 discs back to back.  Hopefully Amazon will offer it soon."
2,I purchased the first starter kit by Pelican,"The one that included a travel case, 4 disc jackets, screen guard, car charger, USB data cable and a polish cloth anyway I didn't much care for it. The USB cable is too short to comfortably put the PSP on the desk while transferring files. The cable is only about 2 feet long so its only long enough to sit on top of the PC which isn't too safe because it could fall. The car charger is cheap because earlier today the thing burned out and when I noticed it the thing was very hot to touch. I had to pull it out of the dc outlet with a napkin! I'm starting to question Pelicans accessories especially since the recall of the power brick now this. On to other things the case holds 4 UMD's with the jackets on, but the two that go in the flap part of the case puts pressure on the PSP screen which over time probably could damage it."
5,A true masterpiece,a true masterpiece in every sense of the word. Ignore the haters this game is amazing.
1,I gave my life. Not for honor. And not for this.,"This game had such promise considering the people who worked on it. Heck I pre ordered out of excitement. But alas I was deeply disappointed. Don't waste your time with this game. The story is bland and the combat is abhorrent. Bullet spounge enemies, no way to control the game. Heck even nearly bricked my PS4. Save a life. Don't buy this. Buy better games."
2,Not the Halo game I was waiting for.,"I bought two copies to play the campaign co-op with my son, and I'm not so happy with the purchase. This is not the Halo game I was waiting for, or hoping to play. The story was lackluster, and borderline incomprehensible unless you follow the expanded Halo universe in other media. Plus, the Master Chief was MIA in his own game and Blue Team was woefully underdeveloped. There's no chance at all that I'll preorder another game from 343. What a letdown."
1,Wrong item. Are you kidding me?,i got a completely diffrent item than I was expecting. It's all hdmi plugins with one out put plug. Seriously. I had greater expectations than this.
1,Disc drive is dead,Disc Drive is dead.. just like most of the other 1 star reviews. Microsoft is sending me a replacement in 7-10 days. Will post a real review after that.
4,Leather Crafting With My Janome HD 3000,Love my Janome HD3000 - Used to make leather purses. Wish I could use on thicker leather - I have to shave the edges before sewing. But I still love the machine!!!!
5,Sony PS4... this IS next gen gaming,"Extremely friendly user interface,  smooth graphics, new dualshock design.... the PS4 exceeded all of my expectations. This is also ready to play right out of the box. Controller, HDMI, headset, and 30 day trial to PlayStation Plus (free games on PlayStation Store). If you want to experience the next generation of gaming, get the PS4. Nuff said."
1,Why,So much money for what a joycon Rediculous
5,listening,"i purchased these for gaming because i couldnt handle the big headsets that are used . i figured these would be awesome and especially light. well honestly the sound was really really good imo, but my ears couldnt handle these as well. i never use or have used any type of headphones or earbuds, always just used speakers for things, so this venture was all new to me. i needed something with a boom mic , so thats why i needed some type of headphones and i just couldnt get use to something in my ears.  eventually had to return these , but it wasnt because of the sound or mic functions. so if your use to earbuds and are looking for an inexpensive but great sounding speakers, these would be a good buy"
1,Money hungry,This game is riddled with micro-transactions the likes of which I've never seen from 2k before. It's literally shameless. It honestly ruins the experience.
5,Madden 21,Great Graphics! Great game play! Deff go get it! Like the new features and small changes
1,One Star,I like what I have played so far but political correctness ruins everything so I give it one star.
5,Incredible for ALL ages!,"This hamilton soundtrack was the first soundtrack I bought off of Amazon, so I was skeptical. I was curious to see what I would get after seeing reviews that the CD was not Hamilton. Surely enough this was not the case with mine. My family and I have played the soundtrack in the car daily and can't seem to get enough of it. It is perfect for all ages. My husband ( a history teacher loves it) and my kids can't get enough of the raps ( especially lafayette) . The CD arrived sooner than expected in one day. It came with two CD's ( Act 1 and Act 2) , and two small books that had all of the lyrics.  As far as soundtrack prices go this was fairly inexpensive. The two only downside to this soundtrack is that you can not download the music onto a phone or a laptop and you can't get enough of it! My family has to take a long road trip coming up and we can't wait to take it with us."
5,Love my Hello Kitty Chair!,"I really love this chair a lot. I ended up getting 2 of these chairs for myself and my mini. The leather feels so soft and amazing, and the chair is so comfortable."
1,Blue light of death,"Received a dead machine with blue light of death. It will not boot, it just has a blue flashing light."
1,Llego incompleto,El codigo ya esta redimido y lo compre el juego antes con la pormo
5,All new all better,"I really thought I'd play this game a week and go back to my old Sims. I loved making houses and neighborhoods so much, and I had so much stuff from Sims Resource and Well Dressed Sims. I just knew there was no way this game could satisfy my building urge. I was very wrong. I have been sucked into a world of stories and intrigue. My best friend and I discuss daily the differences our stories and Sims lives are taking. Who they are marrying, who they are sleeping with, who was born, and who died. When my first Sim died of old age, I actually felt a sense of loss. It's a lot of fun, but be prepared for addiction. Don't get this game unless you have a lot of free time. I'm pretty busy right now and it's driving me nuts. I highly highly recommend this game."
1,Would have been 5 stars but the product is defective,"Out of the box I was very happy with this product, it felt nice in the hands, and fit the joycons nicely. It wasn't until I played a game did I realize that the product was defective. You can see in the picture that they put two right bumpers in for one of the controllers which made it impossible to push the button down. I have asked for another set, and will update this post later."
5,Great for little ones just getting started!,"This set of games was just perfect for our 4 and 5 year olds who are just getting used to working with the remote and playing games on the Wii. No jarring graphics or overly disturbing scenes. These are all plain simple games that everyone would enjoy. The graphics are not the best as one would expect from today's technology, but that's a minor issue. We are loving this game!"
5,Driven,"Okay, I have three different race wheels and this is the best of the three. It tops the one that comes with the game. I would rate the one that came with the game the cheapest of the three. I have to be honest here even though this is the better of them, there is not that big a differance. Go with price."
5,Not just for the Lite,I was worried because my son doesn't have the lite and thought I bought the wrong thing but it works for the big ones too. It works in that black thing so you can play on the TV. ( I don't know what it's called. ) No errors of incompatible popped up like other off brand one may. I bought the brand Nintendo chargers twice and they broke because of bending my son is rough with them but this is working out great!
5,"Cheap Xbox hard drive, for the WIN!","We got our hard drive and installed it on the XBOX 360 with out any issues. Since this XBOX had no saved games on it, we did not have to do a data transfer. Easy peasey. If you have had your XBOX for a while, you will likely wand to pick up the data transfer cable; Other than that, it is a tool-less install. This drive has been running in for several months now and has not had issues."
5,Must BUY!,My son has never been happier with any other Xbox controller as he has with this one. He says his hands fit it perfectly!
4,Good Game,"This is a good game, I literally couldn't put my controller down. Not the best graphics, but for how good the story is the game doesn't need great graphics.  Someone said here it's anti white propaganda, I guess they just couldn't take how the USA was in the 1960s. The language is definitely harsh at times and the way treated some of the people in the game is harsh, but too me it's what bring this game to life."
5,"Works great, colorful. No mouse pad needed.","Great mouse. Doesn't need mouse pad. Which is great because my keyboard tray doesn't have room for a mousepad. Can use it on black wooden table. Colors are great. You can set color for each dpi setting. I use it to play league of legends. Works well so far, I love it."
5,Awesome game if you like the movie!,"I had never even heard of Deadpool before the movie, but I loved it so much that I had to try this game. It feels a little bit like an old Sega Genesis game with updated graphics and I mean that in the best way! There is a good combination of shooting and fighting and the story is entertaining. There is a lot of the same Deadpool humor that is in the movie so if you enjoy old school video games and liked the Deadpool movie, you should love this game!"
5,"Great device,  poor software,  great 3rd party software","I use ds4 Windows with my Asus 4.0 Bluetooth to use my ds4 for pc gaming and emulation games before and was great until I moved into apartment with tons of wifi interferance.  The Bluetooth dongle  still worked but the latency crippled the wireless function.  I hoped that the ds4 adapter would not be hindered by proprietary software and found out that ds4 windows added support for it.  The dongles wireless connectivity is fantastic with ds4 windows.  Works great with pc games,  remote play and emulations.  It's a shame that the dongle only supports 1 controller at a time."
5,Great game! Just know in order to use wii ...,Great game! Just know in order to use wii motes for multiplayer game you must have the wii pro controllers that plug into the back of the wii motes like the nun chucks connect. That's the least expensive option. You can also use wii u game pad and wireless wii u pro controllers.
2,Disappointed,"The developers took a good game and really messed it up. I played Fallout 4 for hundreds of hours and was eagerly awaiting the release of Fallout 76. After playing Fallout 76 for 10 hours, I wish I could return it. If you never played Fallout 4 you might be able to enjoy it."
5,Great value,It is worth it. I personally like the clicking sounds when I play
5,No Words,"Honestly I thought while reading this book that I was going to have so much to say about it. I highlighted comments in yellow, inspirations in blue, shocked moments in Orange and with all that this book has left me speechless. If I were to say anything it would be that you truly have no idea what a person goes through unless your that person, even if you walked the same path you still have no idea about a person. Do not judge things you know nothing about, do not condemn a person for things you don't have the ability to understand, do not hate just to hate, do not take sides in a debate of political and social standards as everyone is different and right in their own way. Live your life the way you choose to live, believe in what you do and who you are. Support your friends and family and spend your time helping others rather than judging and becoming upset over things in this world you either do not understand or can not change. Life is precious, see it for what it is and what you can make it by being open, understanding and loving to all those around you that do not wish you harm. Make life worth living for everyone that you can. Not Speechless after all!!!!"
1,Doesn't last!,"Looks like others have had the same problem - wish I'd known beforehand!  This nunchuk lasted about two months, then started working sporadically and then just died.  It was not mishandled.  Hardware should last a lot longer than that!"
5,Good indie,More games like this please
1,Heavily censored,This version of the game is heavily censored which is a weird decision since the Japanese version is not censored and it also have a complete English language support so if you want to experience this game without any cuts from Localizers then i advise you to buy the Japanese version from Amazon Japan instead.
5,"As a loyal Mario fan I waited in line for three hours to have this gem of an amiibo, totally worth the buy! AMIIBOS RULE!!",GOLD
5,Just right!,"Love it! Switch fits just right and although it was a little odd (least for me) for about an hour getting used to using the bumpers and triggers, adapted quickly enough to where I don't know why I didn't have this right when I purchased my Switch. Great feel, flexible (just enough give), and though I find it a little funny there are small openings for you to release the joy-cons, they're wrapped by the case itself so guessing it was just easier to leave the mold like that when making the case. Whatever it may be, great great case!"
1,Too many negatives.,"Draconian DRM, inability to save, small city size feels more like simtown, expectation to buy from simstore and DLC at launch, lack of terraforming or road control.  This game is still unpolished and needs a lot of work."
2,Poor button response,Not very pleased with this remote. The buttons don't always respond and often need to be pressed with a great deal of pressure.
1,Bought...regret...,"Playing the game, it was terrible.  The server, the DRM, the wait for EA to supposedly fix, its just, just GODAWFUL!  Do not buy this game, it is not worth it.  The way this game is set up, it seems to be another milking product planned out using dlcs later.  Either way, I cancel my card payment as a desperate attempt to get my refund.  Want a full review? Just look at the thousands of other 1-star complaints on this incomplete game."
1,Just check the average of ratings,"The ratings are almost entirely one star since this combat update, and it is such a shame.  People who have been posting against it are not only disappointed in the product, but are hurt by the fact that they REALLY LOVED the game before the update...the game you are buying is wonderful, but once you connect and it gets updated into its present form, you will see exactly how uninspiring it is...I would not flat out recommend you don't buy it, but I would recommend you wait a few months, so that when you do buy it, the game might not be in a condition that sours you on it immediately.  They did build a great game.  Admittedly they almost entirely trashed most of the things I liked about it, but the people are still there to maybe make it good again."
2,Only one save slot and only screen fit and scan line option for visual updates,"I bought this from gamestop not amazon but wanted to give a review firstly let me say there's nothing wrong with the game its self I do think the inclusion of the gameboy games is a little pointless  with the console versions in the same package.  The visuals are not touched up at all as far as I can tell and I know because I still have my Sega and SNES carts with systems and I also have these game running on emulator on my nvidia shield tv and to be honest they actually looks better on the shield, really just the option to stretch image to fill screen and ability to add a scan line filter that's it bo other visual improvements have ben made to these games.  The worst disappoint I feel is the fact that each game only has one save slot so that means only one person can save there progress which is rediculas in 2019"
5,"Fun, but not exactly like other Fallouts!","Fallout 76 feels just like almost exactly like Fallout 4, but you have other players in your game now. Sure there are no human NPCs but other players are their replacement. If you have friends that also play this, I suggest you play with them for the full experience. Overall it feels just like Fallout. Just with others people."
1,Madden 21 is EA's worst attempt at Madden since Madden 06 on XBOX 360,"Madden 21 is a glitch filled, buggy mess. The Face of The Franchise mode is bare bones. The story is mediocre and laughable. The Yard mode is clearly made just for EA to push more micro-transactions on top what they already have. Superstar KO mode is literally just copied and pasted from last year. If you enjoyed that move just play Madden 20. Franchise mode is the same as it was in Madden 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 25, and 13. MUT mode was also untouched showing that the only work they did in this game was the new mode The Yard, except that the yard isn't even polished and is just as buggy as the rest of the game. Stay away from this buggy, broken mess that EA has the audacity to call a game. I am advising you, DO NOT BUY MADDEN 21!"
5,Rugged and stylish,"This box is well made and has foam padding to protect the Xbox.  It also has plenty of room for storing 4 S-controllers, all of the cords, and 6 games without any trouble.  You can fit more, but that is all I have, and it all fits comfortably.  The case itself is a little on the heavy side, but all of that protection and beauty must come at a price."
5,If You Love Jigsaw Puzzles...,"I have always loved jigsaw puzzles. But this is the first time I have ever put one together on a computer. Puzz 3D Orient Express has 4 difficulty levels, from easy to super-challenging. I started off on the third level  which is the challenging level. That level is just as challenging as the  1000-peice puzzles you buy in the store. The only difference is this: once  you put the puzzle together, the fun doesn't stop. The difficulty level you  choose determines how much of the Orient Express you can explore. You get  to meet all kinds of different people as well as learn about the history of  the train. Plus, during the exploration phase, there are other games along  the way as well as clues to a mystery guest who is supposed to board the  train. I haven't finished the exploration portion yet, but I am already  thinking about going back to rebuild the train at the super-challenging  level. This way, I will have unlimited access to the entire train. This  Puzzle is very addictive and fun."
1,Stops working a couple of months after purchase,"This is the second pair I've bought, and the sound starts to cut out after a few months like there's a short in the cord.  I'm very careful with the headset and never wind the cord, and I've never had a headset do this before."
1,Very Disappointed,I am very disappointed with the graphics of this game they are terriable and cheep looking. The game also is slow and pauses and I have to wait at times for it to catch up.  Also the split screen is hard to play in two player.  Overall not happy or impressed
5,Having trouble? Read here!,"So just like everyone else I had trouble getting my licensecond key to work. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THE ZIP FILE FROM THEIR WEBSITE. Go to your amazon account from a laptop or desktop, go to the games and software link and click the link that says how to redeem this item. Copy the link provided in another tab in your Web browser and it should download a zip file automatically. I am a US user so I don't know if it varies from different countries. Since I downloaded from the correct link it has worked perfectly. Just follow my directs and save yourself some headache."
1,GOT A BUSTED WII,BEWARE of seller SPIRAL DINOSAUR!! Extremely disappointed. I even ordered one that cost a little more in the hopes of getting one that was in good shape. It doesn't even work. I don't think I have to describe how disappointing it is to set the whole thing up and then the CD drive wont accept the disk. Amazon should be aware of defective products they are selling.
1,"good idea, but doesn't work","We have had the wii mote for about a month.  It is great....when it is working.  The whole time we are playing games, it will pause and say that ""communication is interrupted.""  Then in a minute it will start up again??  Now this morning the playchuk stopped working at all.  This is increasingly frustrating to a 5 year old....and his mother!!  When it's working, I really like it; but I'm returning it."
1,Until then Sims 3 is best option available at the moment,Realize you aren't buying a complete game even though you are paying for one.  This game was designed to sell DLC and store content.  Hopefully some other developer will see the potential here and give EA a rival to their Sims franchise so they don't pull these shenanigans.  Until then Sims 3 is best option available at the moment.
5,Busy Mom,This does keep my 3 year old busy.  It's good that you advance no matter if you clear the previous screen or not which allows him to play a lot longer than other games that end if you don't win.  There are some cute games in it that do teach him something but aren't too hard for him to understand.  I like this one.
5,PS3,"Lost the cord from my ps3. It being pandemic and all, i wanted to play some old games to pass the time and I found this cord. It is the perfect replacement.  Plugged it in and fired up the ps3 and now I'm playing Tiger Woods PGA 07 all over again!"
1,"Cool, But Not.","I bought this thinking it would work for the Wii to play Twilight Princess, but the signal cannot pass from the WiiMote to the sensor bar because the foam of the sword blocks it making this a useless item."
1,SCAM DON'T BUY,Terrible practice. More than double then you'd originally pay. I don't understand how people like this sleep at night
2,Headset Great . . . Microphone Not,"I like this headset's looks, I like its sound quality, but there's one problem. When I first plugged this thing in, it didn't even register that there was a microphone on it. I tried to go to the control panel and set up a microphone setting - still didn't work. For some reason, when I plugged it back in for like the eighth time, it decided to register and my friends could finally hear me. However, they said, I sounded really awful, distant, and dull. I messed with the settings, and it didn't help at all. I'm going to be returning this headset."
1,HATE IT!,"Just received the game today after waiting a month for it's release only to be extemely disappointed. I thought this would be great to play on a 52"" screen. There is sooooo many graphics, constant view changes and  movement, you never know where you or the ball is. At one point you are only viewing the top half of the machine so as you hit the ball and it begins to head to the bottom flippers you have no idea if you hit the ball until the full view returns and you see you've missed it. Too many time you cannot see the bottom flippers. I thought the 3-D effect would be nice, but it's horrible. I guess what I'm trying to say is everything is way too distracting. A ""still"" overhead view of the machine would be nice. There's even a time when all of a sudden you're seeing a side view of the machine - you try to hit the ball but of course you can't. This is the first pinball video game I've ever tried, maybe I'm just too use to playing on a real pinball machine where you can see the entire playing area at all times, but I must say this was a very annoying experience. Definitely getting rid of it. I should have known better than to buy it before any reviews came out. I've read great reviews about other games but I wanted one for the WII. I'm curious to read what others have to say. Guess I'll go back online (on Amazon of course) and continue my search for a fun pinball game."
5,Kids need to stop whining about the Securom we get the point,"This game is a worthy port that has seen attention to critical points. The game is very well in its gameplay, graphics, and features. The story is immersing and interesting. Many flaws in the xbox 360 version have been addressed and improved upon in the PC version as stated by the Gamespot Review and many others. The kids need to stop crying about DRM "" we get the point "", and on top of that, rating the game when they don't even own a copy. Amazon should only allow reviews based on your actual order history, but yeah, Mass Effect for the PC does not disappoint."
2,This program is vaporware.,"This game is vaporware. I bought this because the site said that they were working on incrimental updates and had lots of screenshots showing major improvements. The unfortunate truth is that the site is no longer taking regestration, and you are limited to only two installations of the software before you must contact the company(which is not responding to emails any longer) Buyer beware, therwise a fun game."
1,no just no,Real money for fake money and you can't fully enjoy to product you already bought till you pay more money hmm wait a min doesn't that sound like extortion?
5,"Works, no problems","Worked great, exactly as described.  Switch is much faster with wired internet"
1,"I'm sure it could technically get worse, but I'm not sure how","I'm sure it could technically get worse, but I'm not sure how. It was delivered in a package that had been torn open and crappily taped together. Memory card didn't even work, it shows there is space but nothing will save to it."
4,"Good, but a bit disorganized.","I enjoyed watching Kasparov discuss the Queen's Gambit with such brilliance, and I agree with other reviewers who say that he comes across as down-to-earh. There is no question about his passion for the game, and any chess player will enjoy the commentary of this legendary grandmaster. I give it four stars because a better production was actually possible. In fact, with a bit of focus and organization, this DVD could have been a valuable instructional tool. The problem is that Kasparov goes on many tangents, and while this is occasionally unavoidable when discussing variations, it can become tedious. It's not a matter of his English, either--he expresses himself well. Overall, I couldn't help but get the impression that this was filmed haphazardly--that is, he probably just sat down and began discussing the opening any which way. What was needed was the careful selection of themes within the framework of the lecture; the DVD could have been divided into crucial minilessons that retained focus instead of random observations with loose-fitting titles. If the aim was to teach, then the approach needs modification. I'm a decent player with club and some tournament experience. I followed him as best as I could, but I can see a beginner being easily overwhelmed and quickly losing interest. As a fan, it's a pleasure to watch him discuss the game; as a life-long student of chess, I expect more."
5,Great rhythm game!,"I imported the Japanese version when it was released and I bought the American version on release as well.  Both are identical in terms of content and it's amazing to finally play the game with translated menus.  A lot of customization and unlockables, can't wait to get them all.  Hopefully the DLC comes too.  Buy it to show Sega we want more of this in the US, and hopefully they localize more quirky games."
1,Didnt Include Advertised Riser,"I like Arcade1up machines. This one advertised the machine and the riser, but when it arrived and I assembled it there was no riser included. I had to go back and double check and it is advertised as being included."
1,"Not what we wanted, not what we expected","I understand a new game will have glitches, but to glitch when buying your first part for your first car in the story mode? Garbage. Also the handling of the cars is laughable. Pretty sad how the best NFS game that will have ever been on the PS4 was the 2015 edition."
5,"Hell, its about time.","This game is going to be worse for my social life than oblivion, my frends won't see me for months!"
4,Mac had a rought start but now works perfect.  KIDS HAVING FUN,"I bought this program for my mac and while I could get it to load it would not keep track of anyone's progress (like it stated that it would).  I contacted the company and was given a patched program that works perfectly now.  I am using for my oldest child to learn to type and the younger one gets on at times too.  It is fun and highly rewarding.  Now that the progress is tracked it is great as he is moving through and learning new things.  The games are so much fun for him, makes it almost seem like a video game and yet he is learning to type at faster speeds.  I love that it breaks it up into chunks that are easier to digest and that there are so many motivating and different areas and games to learn.  I also like the reports and feedback that it gives.  Where I can see the letters and areas where he excels or has difficulty.  I can also see his speed vs mistakes.  This is a great tool and I am so happy that it works perfectly on a Mac now."
4,Ok-but only 1 pair of socks,"I also didn't receive 3 pairs of socks and remember reading the description on Amazon that 3 pairs were included. Of course, I think they realize their mistake and have since changed the description. I emailed the manufactur dreamgrear.net with my name and address and received a response very quickly (same day) that they had a misprint on their packaging but are honoring the misprint and will send out the missing socks in aprox. 4 weeks when they receive the new shipment. So we'll see what happens."
1,Is this Madden '12 or '09?,"For the unfortunate people who can't afford to purchase a PS3, and have to settle with buying Madden '12 for PS2, I feel sorry for all of us. I feel like I'm playing Madden '09! Where are the upgrades, if any? The rosters are so wrong! I caught myself releasing, trading, and picking free agents up (on basically every team!) just to update the current transactions that have happened the past few months. Not to mention, all the rookies that are missing. What a disappointment! The franchise mode is still the same as '09...and by that, I mean it's horrible. I was so excited to purchase this game, but I completely regret it now. Such a waste of money. If they were planning on keeping the same game as '09 (besides the roster changes, big deal, whatever), at least warn us so we save our money. I highly, highly, HIGHLY, recommend that you DON'T buy this game, for PS2 at least; I'm sure it's great on PS3."
1,WARNING . ONLINE ONLY,this is online only you can't even play solo without playstation plus  what is wrong with these company's Specially Turtle Rock Studios and warner bros studio making this title internet require and most people don't have internet and any solo gameplay should never had to be internet requirement.
4,"Nice accessory for your Wii U Gamepad, good grade of protection.","I bought the red version, and despite how it looks on the picture, believe me, it really is red. My only issue with this protector is that came folded in the box, and when I put it on my Wii U Gamepad, its fold marks has not disappeared yet."
5,Contains PS4 Version 1.15 on Disc,"Unlike what the picture shows, there is no code in the box. Rise of the Giant and Bad Seed DLCs are included on the disc for this ""Prisoner's Edition"" version of the game. PS4 Version 1.15 (The Bestiary Update) installs from the disc."
1,One Star,I have to pay 55 dollars for a 50 dollar card???? This is insanity.
1,Over priced,This is overpriced and not the market value. Gamestop has it for 299.99. nintendo said the price would be 299.99. What the hell is this?
5,Great way to build excitement!,"Like many others, Thumpback is the one my 7 year old Grandson wants the most. This has been a great way to teach him good things come to those who wait. Sure he was disappointed but after we explained how it will be fun to discover new things in the game and enjoy it longer once Thumpback is released he got over his disappointment quickly. Especially since he already has 21 characters to date. Geeze people, if your kids are so spoiled that you are angry over a toy's release date you have bigger problems than the release date of a toy. We are having a great time with the ones that have been released and look forward to the rest being released to extend the play time on this great game for kids."
5,Great purchase. Saved me from replacing the controller,Fit perfect. My kids drop the controller so much and I didn't want to buy a whole new one because they are pricey. These fit perfect.
1,a review only for true RPG fan,"This is a horrid game galavanting around as a RPG, let alone final fantasy, one of the best RPG series ever created. This game has no exploration, no choice control, no individuality, you can't even interact with NPCs!  If you don't know what a NPC is then this game may be just what you're looking for.  If this game did not have the title of Final Fantasy then perhaps it could be enjoyable.  Having such a name dishonors all the great gaming which came before this abberation! You can't control party leader, give commands, or freely explore.  My apologies for the rant, it is such a shame that this ONCE great franchise has fallen to such lows.  Stay away those looking for a RPG experience.  This is a CG movie of epic proportions interspersed with a few button presses from you, the ""controller;"" when I say few I do mean FEW."
1,Best Left on the Darkside,"Darksiders 3 tells the story of Fury, sent to earth to vanquish the Seven Deadly Sins. Fury is one of the Horseman of the Apocalypse and is sent to a post-apocolyptic world? Planet? Somewhere? I played the first two Darksider Games and they were enjoyable Hack and Slash adventures with a few minor puzzles thrown in for enjoyment, plenty of spaces to roam free, although it was not open world, and a decent story. Darksiders 3? Not so much. The game is ugly to look at, the environment is crudely drawn, there are no real puzzles to solve, the camera angles are awful, the gameplay is glitchy. You can select from several different modes of play. The problem with these modes of play are that the difference between easy and balanced would be the difference between moderate and ""kill me now"" in any other videogame. Easy mode is a cakewalk, Balanced will have you hollering in high def! You are not able to switch modes if you find one or the other too difficult or too easy during your actual game. The other unfair and awful aspect of this game is that it rarely saves your progress so if you die you basically get sent back...waaaay back to the beginning of an area. Clumsy, unworthy of the xbox one and just about any other commercially released game out there, Darksiders 3 is just an ugly, rushed mess. Blessedly, the game is relatively short! One day I will actually follow through on my promise not to purchase games right upon release."
5,Great if this is what you want,"I did a review on the circular gates which I feel is superior to these if you want the authentic Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat experience from the 90's. Most people get these for that very experience which I felt was not accurate. The 90's fighter cabs used circular plates, not octagonal, which is why the circular motions were smooth when performing special moves such as hadokens. With these octagonal gates you will get a bumpy feeling when executing those types of moves which can be ok if what you are looking for is to be able to jump diagonally with precision. That is what is good about these octagonal gates is that you will be able to jump diagonally with less issues than circular plates but my point is that octagonal is not the more authentic experience. In the Arcade 1up modding scene, octagonal gates seem to be the preferred suggestion to new people asking for advice on what they should use but if you ask me, I would say try the circular gates if you want authenticity, if you want jumping diagonal accuracy then go for the octagonal gates. Hope this review helps you out. Thanks."
5,A,As described
5,Very good purchase!,"This product was exactly what I was looking for in a video game, and I enjoyed the quality throughly. Also, the game arrived on-time without any ridiculous shipping prices or delays."
1,"No snug fit, tracking doesn't work when it matters","If your getting this headset for some casual play or just to explore scenery, it's perfect. But if you want play real games and get into it, it fails to keep tracking when you need it most. Until they release the option to use lighthouses for tracking, I would not recommend getting this in it's current state. HTC's inside-out tracking tech is far behind Oculus's. I often found when I brought the controller up to my face to aim with a weapon, it's loses tracking and flings around everywhere. I regret getting this headset early, if you want inside-out tracking, get Oculus. They're way farther ahead with their software then HTC is. The fact that they thought they could release a headset in this state is just unacceptable. The flip design is great, but there no eye relief, and I'm constantly losing the sweet spot. If they had a way to properly secure it to your face, it'd be perfect. The headphones that come with it are cheap. They snap up and snap down, I often found they never stayed snapped down hard enough that they'd snap back up."
5,Never getting bored!!!!,"I am 43 years old, and I absolutely love this  game!  It isn't difficult and when I showed my brother (47 years old) he wanted to play!  I can not say enough good things about this game. I purchased one other game and regretted it...it was made for a 4 year old and the movements, handling eveything just stunk (poor 4 year old).  But I mean it was terrible, the horse looked like he walked out of a coloring book.  BUT, not this game!!!  Awesome guys...just loads of fun."
5,They work great with my PlayStation 4,"They work great with my PlayStation 4. Audio quality is good. They are flexible so they fit good on your head and don't put too much pressure on your ears. I would recommend these. I received this product at a discount or free in exchange for my honest review. I am not connected with the company and I don't have any monetary gain. I'm  not required to leave a positive or false review, I just test the products and leave my honest review. My opinions are based on my personal experience with the product that I'm reviewing and I will update my rating and review if my opinion about the product changes."
2,"Eh, not really sure these are worth the discounted price i paid","Not sure how much these really add to the game. The vehicles are limited to the Toy Box area, which me and my son don't really play in all that often. We typically play the racing add-on, which is excellent, or play through the Star Wars story add-ons."
4,"A bit tricky to install, and not nearly as much of an improvement as I had hoped","This wasn't particularly easy to install. It required soldering a wire, which wasn't too tricky for me, but a novice could easily damage their Steam Deck. One thing worth noting is that my Steam Deck's original analog sticks had something covering the solder joint preventing it from being desoldered. I didn't notice at first since it was a mostly transparent sort of film. Once I pealed off that coating, it was pretty simple for me to desolder the wire for the analog stick and move them over to the new analog boards. The zeroing not the analog sticks aren't perfect, but I was able to reduce the deadzone a little. I think the main benefit of these analog sticks comes from the fact that they won't suffer from stick drift. I'm not sure they're worth buying if your current analog sticks are working properly, but if you want to prevent the analog sticks from developing drift then these do just that."
1,Doesn't Work,I bought and downloaded this game on release day.  All the server were full and then I was finally able to join a server shortly after I was disconnected.  The game was saved on that one server and if I didnt connect to it i would have to start over.  There is also a mandatory tutorial that you have to play anytime you join the server for the first time.
5,PS5,"I was really skeptical but it came in about a day and in original packaging. Set up was fairly easy and I love it so far. If you have the chance to buy this, do it!"
4,More detail than AC4 (for advanced pilots) but less fun.,"Aero Elite outclasses Ace Combat 4 in terms of realism and detail but sacrifices fun in the name of it. The weapons, for example, are exact to the real specs and number. You have to pay close attention to your speed and altitude when landing, especially if you're flying VTOL in a Marine Corps AV-8B Harrier. The vertical take-off and landing feature of the Rolls Royce Engine only engages at a specific airspeed. Going through the VTOL training really helps you learn the basic skills for flying the AV-8B Harrier. Unlike Ace Combat 4, you can pre-program your replay views before saving it and even choose a different background music. Not to mention, you get the whole replay for the entire length of the game! Ace Combat 4 only replays the last 4 minutes and you cannot save each individual replay movie. Aero Elite even lets you land any plane on a city freeway or on almost any flat surface you can find on the face of the Earth like parking the F-16 Falcon on that helipad in front of your house in the Snowy Mountains Mission. Try parking the huge F-15E inside the pyramid in the desert mission. Mastering the technique of landing the AV-8B Harrier on the LHA at sea can be hard to learn at first but you'll be proud once you get it right and to watch or show that perfect replay is almost enough reason to own this game. Not recommended for beginner pilots. Advanced pilots dare this!"
5,The Playstation 4 is a(Almost...) perfect video game console,"Had to get this because i sold my original playstation 4 when i was in tough financial times. Only problem i have with this bundle is that the 500gb may seem like a lot of space, but in actuality it can only hold maybe 7 to 8 full length playstation 4 games, which means that i as well as people who bought the 500gb playstation 4 will have to keep downloading and deleting games to make room(once a game is either downloaded digitally or with disc, the game is automatically saved into your playstation network account so even if you delete your games, you can always redownload them for free) OR buy and install a new hard drive.Besides that and the bs policy of having to actually pay for playstation plus when it used to be free, The playstation 4 is by far the best video game console on the market today."
4,Works as Promised,My son loves it. There was definitely a learning curve to using this fluidly but he mastered it with a little help from reading the actual instructions!!
1,Big Disapointment!!,"I have been waiting for this game to come out on the store shelves for so long, as I am a huge fan of Wii Sports and thought it would be similar but with more games. I was really let down. The controls are so hard and don't seem natural in anyway. Save your money."
5,perfect,exactly what I was looking for
5,Works as advertised!,"I'm not terrible sure of it's durability, I would still be worried about dropping my Switch in this case, but for the purpose of travelling, it's perfect!  It stores all my games and the console neatly, and I'm not worried about the console taking damage while it's in the case in a backpack or bag."
5,When you need it fast,"Recently found my Game Boy Advance SP and still have quite a collection of games to replay, but I couldn't find the charger for the SP, so rather than waste my time trying to find the whereabouts of the cable, I decided to buy one from here. It works just as described, and I'm glad the price is extremely reasonable."
5,A really bad decision.,"This piece of crap toy didn't work. I never saw a single pack of mischievous monkeys; no crazy hunter; no angry rhinoceros. That said, however, a old 'n' hairy comedian emerged within the first 10 minutes of playing. He was cool, I guess, but he wouldn't stop playing with my electric toothbrush."
5,One of the best purchases I've ever made.,"Street Fighter II tournaments?! Old school Mario Cart Cups?! Dr. Mario till the cows come home?! Yes please.  These controllers are excellent!  One of the best purchases I've ever made, as we've gotten hours and hours of great fun out of them and will be doing moreso.  Pretty much plug and play, sometimes a little fiddling depending on the emulators you are using...Round 1: FIGHT!"
5,Great for parties,"I first saw the game at a party of adults (27 and up). Instead of sitting and drinking, everyone was in front of the TV and playing, laughing and having fun. It is a great game to get some exercise, challenge your friends and have a good laugh. Unlike all the games that come out lately with fights and violence this is an absolutely innocent game suitable for all. Good also for parents to play and spend time with their video addicted kids. Can't wait for the US release to buy it."
1,A game that relies on online registration for so much content shouldn't need DRM,This DRM is ridiculous.  I bought this directly from the EA store and I have no idea how many activations I can make.  Even reading online about the retail box version I see a 3 and a 5 activation limit.  Nowhere before during or after downloading from EA or before during or after installing was I told how many activations I have total or remaining.  I hope if I still like this game a few years and computers from now I will still be able to install and play it.  I did buy it after all.
5,The power of an Amazon review,"I had all but written off this game because of the barrage of negative reviews, but the consensus from the users that managed to actually get the game installed was that it was good. I took a trip down to my local store and saw the game for the same price as on this website. I decided to take a chance, after reading that Ubi had put out a patch for this game. True enough patch 1.0.3 seems to have cleared up any issues with requiring a CD to run the game, as I'm running the program now with nothing in the CD drive. I have noticed to crashes or problem. The game is fun and a good investment."
5,Good at first...,"but, as soon as I started typing the s would get stuck and well, I couldn't turn a paper in a whole bunch of s.  I tried getting it replaced, but apprently it was the only one."
5,must have !,they fit perfectly to my controller
5,Simply Amazing!,"This is a very deep dev kit that is very easy to pick up and well thought out. Navigation  using only the dualshock is good enough that move controllers are not necessary. Once you start playing around in Dreams you really get addicted to exploring all the fantastic options. While the tutorials are excellent and easy to comprehend,  my only complaint is they should be a little better organized from the beginner to advanced lessons. I think Dreams is a huge milestone in the history of gaming, thanks for making something so cool!"

I do love that the mic doesn't pick up a bunch of background noise, although at times it feels like I have to scream for it to pick up my voice.  Guess you can't have the best of both worlds, but that'd be the loss of a star.  If you're looking for a headset that will work for a very good price, i'd recommend getting this one!"
5,Best way to experience Nintendo's 3D on the switch.,"This headset is well made for the price, decently comfortable.  I had to adjust the straps so that they pull up just a little, because I find that my big nose gathers condensation which can fog up the lenses.  Compared to that joke the Nintendo Labo 3D VR goggles, these are a must buy for anyone who really wants to play switch in 3D.  I am playing Breath of the Wild with these.  It looks good, but the pixels do kinda stand out too far.  I don't know.  For less than 20 bucks how can you go wrong?"
